V  Please freeze for a moment. Gentlemen, what did you think about your performance? I wouldn't say "terrible," but were you accurately on pitch, all of you?\u000a No.\u000a No. Like as soon as the ladies came in, you were like, "Whoo," and then you forgot what you were singing. Okay? So, don't let them distract you. They're trying. They're trying to have this beautiful sound and pull you off. But hold firm, men. Hold firm to your position.  All right? Let's try it again. Here we go. \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a Lock it in. \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a Two parts. \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a Together. \u266a Sing we all noel!\u266a The support! \u266a Sing we all noel!\u266a\u000a Two parts. \u266a Sing we all noel! Sing we all noel! \u266a Back to the beginning. \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a End song. All right. If you were going to give yourself a grade, what would you give it, Alison? As a class.\u000a  Like out of A's and B's and C's?\u000a Yep.\u000a I would give an A-minus.\u000a Okay, and why the minus? What do you think we think need to improve?\u000a The pitch was kind of off at some parts.\u000a Okay. So there was maybe some pitch issues. What about energy level? It was okay, but this.... But one of the things about African music is it is something that is like felt in their soul. Okay. It is traditionally, when you listen, I mean, they are just letting it... You know, when we see any of the performances, or listen to any of the CDs we've listened to, it's just very gut-felt. I feel like you're, "\u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a" So, "This is so pretty." Yes, we want, "\u266a SING NOEL, SING NOEL, NOEL, NOEL. \u266a" Especially on that, "\u266a Sing we all noel. \u266a" That's me. We're singing! It's like you're telling people, "We are singing!" Not, "\u266a Sing, I think, we all noel. \u266a" Okay? So let's make sure that we're right there on that. One more time. See if you can get a little more weight to your sound. I don't mean make it flat. I just mean with more confidence, more security, more support, Okay? Here we go. \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a Awesome! \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a Two part. \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a Support this! \u266a Sing we all noel! Sing we all noel! \u266a \u266a Sing we all noel! Sing we all noel! \u266a \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a Good. And stop there. So you get the idea. That was awesome! Did you hear the difference?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Awesome. I love that you challenged yourselves. You pushed yourselves there. It's hot. Those notes are kind of high. I know that. And you just pushed right through it. So good job. Let's review the instrument parts we just got to touch on last time. So, I'm going to come here so we can do our body percussion. Real quick. We are going to start with our bass part. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not going to use these right now because traditional African music is by rote, meaning you learn it by hearing. You learn it by doing. If you are a visual learner, these are our music stands by the instruments, so this will help you. And you know, I want everyone to be successful, so you use the tools that will help you be successful. You be an independent learner where you decide. If this is what you need, grab a music stand. Okay? If you don't, you don't need it. Okay? So there are music stands in each of the instrument sections when you pick. Okay? So, basses first. Let's all kind of scoot over this way. So bass section first. We have, starting with your left hand,  "\u266a Sing, oh sing, oh sing noel \u266a\u000a  "\u266a Sing, oh sing, oh sing noel \u266a\u000a And you have that crossover.  "\u266a Sing, oh sing, oh sing noel \u266a\u000a Everybody feel comfortable with that? Any questions? You look good. You look like you have it. All right. Then we have the xylophones. This one's a tricky one. So we have, for that part... Let me just double check on our words that we decided for last time. So, we have,  "\u266a Sing noel, sing noel. Let's simply celebrate it. Sing noel. Sing noel. Let's simply celebrate it. \u266a"\u000a   Sing noel. Sing noel.  Let's simply celebrate it. Sing noel. Sing noel.  Let's simply celebrate it. \u266a\u000a Okay? So the trickiest part is how many G's. All right. So remember, we have low C and high C, So you have, "C, C, C. C, C, C." And there's four Gs over that syncopated rhythm. G, G, G, G, F, E, D. Okay? So it's kind of like, "One, two, three, down the ladder you go." Okay? So let's try that.\u000a C, C, C. C, C, C. G, G, G, G, F, E, D. C, C, C. C, C, C. G, G, G, G, F, E, D.\u000a Got it? Got the idea? All right. Then we go on to the glockenspiels. And for that one, we can just clap that rhythm, because I think on the instruments it will be easier to see, to show, because they're so obviously a little, so it's not really like that. So here we go. It goes, "\u266a Sing, oh, yes, sing noel, noel. \u266a"\u000a \u266a Sing, oh, yes, sing noel, noel. Sing, oh, yes, sing noel, noel. \u266a\u000a Okay? Got the idea for that rhythm? So I will come over and help that section, and some of you may remember that from last time. Then we have our percussion section. Okay? We have first the conga drum. A real quick review on conga drum playing. Everything in you is going to want to tip it toward you. If we can kind of spin back here so I can show you. When you play a conga drum you scoot over this way a little bit. And scoot over that way. There we go. So, when you play conga drum, you actually are going to hold it in between your legs, and put your feet around the base, and you're going to tip it out from you. So that that way the sound can come out, but you also have the correct play style. Remember pat on the ends. when you're playing. And those are in... You can pat this on your lap as well. \u266a  \u266a Right now, practice on your fingers. Okay? So here's on this. Practice with a good technique, right now. Ready. Go. \u266a  \u266a\u000a     \u266a This is the part of the conga drum.\u266a \u000a All right. You've got the idea? And that goes over and over, each measure. Then we have the log drum. And the log drum... And again, the parts are right here on the stand if you need them. You're going to have... One side, you're going to play, "Sing." So basically... \u266a  \u266a And it doesn't matter with those. "Sing noel, sing noel, sing noel." Okay? So you can clap that real quick.\u000a  Sing noel, sing noel, sing noel, sing.\u000a Okay? See how it fits? Hello. Welcome.\u000a Thank you very much.\u000a All right. So. Next we are going to have this part, which is traditional African bell. And this one you have, "Rest, rest, rest,  noel." Sorry, hi to low. So it's, "Rest, rest, rest,  noel.  Rest, rest, rest,  noel, rest."  Can you snap it?  Noel. Rest, rest, rest,  noel. "Rest, rest, rest,   noel. And you can try it. Rest, rest, rest. Hi and fast.  Noel. Rest. Get them up!   Noel. Rest, rest, rest,   noel. Yes. Ladies and gentleman, I'm always spot-checking to see if you have rhythmic accuracy when we're doing this. It's really important that I see that participation. Because then when we go to pick parts, I'm looking to see who has it. Yes, there's choice, but also to check you off on including this rhythm thing. Okay? So let's try it again. Ready. Go. Rest, rest, rest. \u266a  \u266a Rest, rest, rest. \u266a  \u266a Rest, rest, rest,  noel.  Rest, rest, rest,  noel. You got it. And then,  I love these shakers.  You are the pulse. You are the heartbeat and the foundation of this song. So it would really be nice if you could pulse with my pulse so we could all pulse together. So again, really important. We might add in some other, more African instruments. They're kind of loud, so we'll see if you can get the correct sound.  So what I'd like you to do now. Do you have any question? All right. If you really mastered the instrument that you got to start on last time, I would challenge you to maybe pick a different one. Okay? If you were still working on it, you're welcome to stay there. But without any payoffs, so just kind of selection, I would like you all to go and pick an instrument part. Remember we have glockenspiels, basses, xylophones, and percussion. So open? Two glockenspiels open, and a bunch of xylophones open. Who was there first? Who was there first between you and Ellen?\u000a  I was here.\u000a You were there? Okay. So if you want to join the glockenspiels, you can do that. You can go to xylophones. Oh, nobody's up to the challenge. \u266a  \u266a All right. Once you get there, you can start practicing.  \u266a  \u266a All right. Hold up, everybody! All right. Thank you. Since we're trying to add in some singing over the top of it eventually, if you have the green mallets, would you, especially for you guys, switch them out with the felt mallets instead? So here's a set. Well, you need those for that as well. So we have one. There should be another one in there.\u000a  Oh, here, right here.\u000a Nope, those are green. You don't want those.\u000a  Oh, here's another one, right here.\u000a Here, here you go, here's a set That's awesome. Thank you. Because that's just going to make it a lot softer, and not quite as angry sounding. All right. So, let's listen to each part so you can know what you're listening for. Remember, when you are playing in an ensemble like this, if you can't hear the other parts, what does that tell you?\u000a  You're playing too loud.\u000a Yes, you're playing too loud. And remember, again, texture is everything. We want to be able to pull out the different parts, so maybe at the end we can talk about different ways we can set up a form to highlight that. But for right now, let's make sure that we can keep it soft. Okay? It's not a competition. All right? No one's going to win. It's the whole class that we're trying to do this together. So if we hear bass part first. And let's go ahead and add at least shaker for right now, and then we'll build in one or two sections. One, two, ready, go. \u266a  \u266a Okay. Time out. So, you're listening for the beat. She's watching me instead of the basses, right? Because you're doing their work a little bit, and you need to keep it nice and steady. What happened, we ended up with three different tempos. Did you hear that? One, two, ready, go. \u266a  \u266a Okay. Pretty good. And then we started to kind of get off where the beginning of the patterns are. Okay. One thing that will help is adding the singing to it. Okay?\u000a

V Hi, welcome to the library  media center. At the entrance, we post school community events and have some newspapers so that our readers can keep up with the current news and community happenings. At our situation desk we have a suggestion box, our series list, and magazines  and books to entice students as they check out. In our commercial seating area we have state book award nominees and winners, as well  as numerous magazines for you in the library for your checkout. For the teachers, I have a professional library with over 3,000 books, DVDs, manipulatives and kits, developed to support the curriculum. Fiction is concentrated on the right side of the library. The paperbacks, a student favorite, arranged by genre just like in retail stores. All of the series books are clearly labelled so students can quickly find the next book in a series. I give special consideration to my reluctant reader's needs if students interests were looking for fiction, or making sure we have quality literature for all reading levels. We have 13 desktop computers, and a mobile laptop lab with which students access the internet, numerous databases, Impact, and a variety of software. On the school library website, they find reviews,  blogs, links to resarch sites,  as well as book suggestions, trainers, and podcasts, many of which are created by the students. On the left-hand side of the library, the reference and the non-fiction sections are located. Our many biographies are housed on the non-fiction side of the center counter. I have many displays throughout the  library and around the school, but two of the most effective ways I encourage student interaction with literature is by display of their works such as book reviews, or projects, and by intermingling related materials to encourage further exploration of the topics. I keep the collection current and relevant through annual reading and by following  my collection development plan so I can offer my patrons  a fantastic collection with enthusiastic and professional service.\u000a ?\u000a . \u000a But we don't, we don't find our food and just like... \u000a The three little pig wolf thing? .\u000a .\u000a She counted all the way up. And she wants to know the lines or something.\u000a We're going to, now that you guys have most of your categories filled in, I would like for you to flip over the lab sheet that's in front of you. There are two reviews for this book. Compare what you have on your graphic organizer to what you find in the review. If you had mentioned that Bridge was a protagonist, or basically mention Bridge and give some description of Bridge, then that would be something that is in common with one of the reviews. If you find something in common, circle it on your graphic organizer. I would like for you to circle everything on your graphic organizer that you also see in the reviews. And again, you can work with your partner on this one. \u000a .\u000a . \u000a .\u000a  it talks about what they deserve and . \u000a 30 more seconds. That's okay, . Did you find that there were several things in common between the elements you looked  for and found in the story? and what you find in the review?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  The review has some additional items in it, doesn't it? There are a lot of people  with the same basic items. Anyway, I wanted to do a quick Venn-diagram up here, and compare and contrast. I want for each group, this group, I want each of the two of you to find one thing that you found that wasn't in the review. Or, one thing that was in the review that was not on your paper. Okay, . Okay, you guys, I want you to find, one for each of those groups, I want you to find one thing that was in common . So this is compare, this is contrast. Contrast, compare. Find one thing that was in common, and one thing that's different. Oh, okay, here's a sticky in the middle of the table, I want you to write it on the sticky. You guys  hard.   Awesome, step up here and tell  us what it is and where does it go. ?\u000a . Awesome, perfect. So all you guys came up with a . \u000a We did like don't count your chickens  before they hatch  and it was in our graphic organizer .\u000a Oh, okay, .\u000a .\u000a .\u000a Perfect, and that was .\u000a .,\u000a Good, perfect. Okay, so everybody here found something that they had that wasn't in the review, it was in their graphic organizer. . You guys, come on up. This table, everyone at this table is looking for something that was found in both their graphic organizer and in the review.\u000a We found .\u000a Super, .\u000a .\u000a Super, so that goes in the middle because it's in common with both of them. This group?\u000a .\u000a Perfect, they found both in the review and in their organizer that .\u000a .\u000a So that was a? What category ?\u000a .\u000a Oh, was that in common? Did you find it in the review also or was it...?\u000a .\u000a Just you guys found it? So where would it go? Excellent, excellent. That would go in the graphic organizer because it was something that wasn't in the review, so it would go over here, perfect. Okay, next?\u000a We found that the .\u000a Okay, so you found something that was only in the review that the, how the pigs disguised themselves. Where do we put that on that? Excellent, something that was only found in the review. Save the best for last. What'd you guys find?\u000a We found that the graphic organizer and the review, they both talked about  that related to  like the .\u000a The allusions in there, Wizard of Oz, Three Little Pigs, Excellent, that was . So we see an awful lot is in common with these. Sometimes, you guys find something that aren't in the reviews, the reviews sometimes had  something you didn't find. They are a little bit different. Not necessarily in your review cover every literary element there is. You won't necessarily tell them the five different types of literary devices that are used there, and that's okay. What you want to do with your review is tell some about the book, and give a substantiated opinion of the book. Why do ? What are the good features of this book? What are the weaknesses in the book that you read? Now there are other things that you may need in there, and I'll show where you can get some additional information. Let's bring this on down here. In the online catalog. Both of those computers are logged in over there. . Okay, look up. So far . So if you want to make a note of how many pages as a reminder to yourself, "Oh yeah, that was a really long book",  or "Oh, that was a quick read." That would be something to kind of jog your memory there. Things like, "Oh yeah, this was about Korea."\u000a

V Write at the top of your paper The color that you want for your sugar and the color you want for your salt\u000a on both of them? Sugar on one, salt on the other\u000a Yes, because you can make from your sheet two.  Now the purpose of these sheets is so you can actually take your spoon Malik, take your spoon and dip out onto that paper. This gives you a better visual of how much sugar and how much salt is in that particular food. Now what's the most important thing about the label?\u000a Serving Size\u000a Serving size. Good Aaron, serving size. So that is showing most of these is the container itself. That's the reason we went to snack foods so that you could see how much that is. This also gives you a better idea of how much you eat. Some of you, like Aaron, may eat two or three of these especially if it was Gummies, right Aaron?\u000a Yes\u000a It's not Gummies but it's close Okay, so any questions before you get started? Okay, decide who is going to do calculations decide who's going to measure first I want you to rotate those responsibilities around and Devon, what is your question?  Remember the personal column is how much you would eat \u000a  the serving size\u000a Doesn't matter, your group remember has to cooperate, figure out who's going to do what and just look at responsibilities\u000a  Just make sure everyone sees how much sugar; how much salt it is That's the important part. On the back of your paper.\u000a  When it says about 29 grams right here\u000a What's the serving size?\u000a Serving size is here...  there are four servings in here\u000a  They would eat half the bag then it would be two servings \u000aSo next is the total calories, and it's got...\u000a 130 calories\u000a total carbs \u000a ok so nine grams\u000a Now when you dip out your salt and sugar try to replace it in the correct bucket we don't want the salt in the sugar or the sugar in the salt. So pay attention to what you're doing. \u000a Now remember, you have to calculate what you would eat. \u000a  Give me some sugar.\u000a  11 grams divided by four. \u000a Put two teaspoons on here \u000a  Is it sodium?\u000a Dip it out you see how much See visually how much it is. \u000a I don't have any salt. \u000a Yes Paul  I want to encourage you that after you done something that's really sugary, do something that you would think would be salty as if it surprises you, how much sugars in it \u000a

V Does everyone agree on the first question?\u000a Yeah.\u000a What did you all agree on?\u000a That it wasn't really fair for--\u000a For First and Second Class to go through without any problems, and the people from the Steerage had to go through examinations, and this whole, long hassle.\u000a And why was that? Why did people who were First and Second Class just get to come right on in and not have to go through examinations?\u000a Cause of the money.\u000a What about the money?\u000a Because they thought that they had-- they were perfect. They had no disease. They had lots of money, and thought they would work hard.\u000a So the stereotype is, what?\u000a That rich people are more-- can work harder, or have less chance of disease than the people in Steerage.\u000a Do you think that that stereotype is still true today? Or do you think it's not true anymore? It was just for First and Second Class passengers for Steerage passengers before emigrating?\u000a Well, it's kind of like this. It's not over-the-top, but it's just a little bit.\u000a What do you guys think about what Eric said?\u000a I agree with him.\u000a Why?\u000a It's not fair because First and Second Class usually are kings or royalty, and so if you're in Steerage, you're just a normal person. If you're in Steerage, it's not going to be fair. You have to go walk through that and--\u000a Well, First and Second Class Passengers they weren't necessarily royalty, they were just people who had a lot of money. People who had enough money to buy those tickets which they were really expensive. What do you guys think about what Eric said? That the stereotype today is still here, but not really? Just kind of back-and-forth?\u000a It's back-and-forth. They don't do the same thing anymore.\u000a Who's "they"? And what's the "same thing"?\u000a The American Embassy. The people that take care of the immigrants and everything, and all about them. They don't go to Ellis Island anymore.\u000a They don't go to Ellis Island anymore.\u000a You have to go on a plane, or you have to drive here.\u000a But do you think the stereotype, in general, that rich people are better or they don't have diseases, and they're just better than people who don't have a lot of money? Do you think we still have those stereotypes today? \u000a Sometimes.\u000a Sometimes? Have you seen it ever?\u000a No.\u000a No, but you just think it's still there?\u000a I haven't really seen it at all.\u000a Yeah, I agree with .\u000a Okay. You can start the next one. Hold on. Josh, did you have something else to add?\u000a Yeah. On TV shows, sometimes they have rich people in huge carriages with horses sometimes.\u000a And they're usually pretty snotty.\u000a And how do you know they're snotty?\u000a They're always like, "Don't touch that! "It's going to fall and you're going to pay for that!"\u000a Oh, okay. So you do see in TV sometimes?\u000a Yeah.\u000a All right.\u000a Do you think immigrants were treated fairly at Ellis Island? Why or why not?\u000a I don't think they were treated very fairly, because they had to go through .\u000a I agree with Jacob because sometimes people just sent them back at Ellis Island, but some doctors at least tried to keep us here to help us be better until we got to stay in America.\u000a Yeah, and that was good that the doctors are supposed to check them and see if they were okay.\u000a Some of the doctors, two people could have the same diseases, but both the doctors-- one doctor could send one person home, and one person could stay at Ellis Island which is unfair.\u000a Possibly because of their religion or the way-- their language?\u000a I think they were mostly--\u000a I think they were mostly, yeah.\u000a So they were mostly treated well, but sometimes not?\u000a Sometimes not.\u000a Yeah.\u000a The doctors or the inspectors might think that one person can stay because of their religion or their language and others might have to be sent back.\u000a And remember the book that we read? It kind of said that-- the cousin, he had to be sent back to-- well, he almost had to be sent back to his country because--\u000a To Russia.\u000a Yeah, to Russia, because he had a scratch and they thought it was infected. His father was trying to tell him, but they didn't listen.\u000a Yeah. He didn't.\u000a  I think they should have translators with all of them, so then it would make it fair.\u000a That spoke English, and that language.\u000a That language. So they can understand things.\u000a So I would say, mostly.\u000a Yeah. Mostly.\u000a So should we check them both off?\u000a I think we should check off the first one.\u000a  If they were sick or something, or if they needed food, they had places where they could get food. Or if they were sick and had to go to the hospital, like Sophia said. So I'm in the middle. Kind of. Because sometimes, they were treated badly.\u000a I agree with Josh because if they were sick, they would probably be treated less fairly because they were sick and had their diseases. Like, "Oh! Get away from me, because you're going to spread that disease to everybody. It's going to be an epidemic."\u000a I want to add, if they were sick, they could have been contagious, and there were a lot of people at Ellis Island so they might have--\u000a Usually if they were at a hospital, they were curing curable diseases, because if they couldn't cure it-- they didn't have a medicine or anything to cure that, they got sent back.\u000a Yeah, I agree with Eric and Sophia...\u000a Go ahead. Were you going to say something?\u000a I was going to say, if we all agree on this...\u000a So your general feeling here is: were they treated fairly at Ellis Island?\u000a They weren't treated not very fairly. Like they were treated half the fair that they should have been, but they weren't treated really good.\u000a They were fed very well, and all their needs were there, but they weren't treated very good like if you were on an airplane in First Class.\u000a It's kind of like--\u000a I would like to add, they were treated way better in Ellis Island because on the ship, in Steerage, they didn't have good food. They couldn't really bathe, and it was all crowded. They didn't really have a good place to sleep, but in Ellis Island, they actually had okay food. They weren't treated like .\u000a Do you think that it was fair that they each had to have $20 on them in order to stay?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Sort of. Sort of.\u000a What I think is they need to take care of themselves and America is actually bringing lots of them over here. America just could say, "Stop. No more immigrants, at all," but they've been letting people in. A lot of people in, and they've been very generous by giving them food, and letting them live here in this wonderful country. So they've provided enough.\u000a I have something-- I have two things to say. I agree with Sophia because-- I sort of agree with Sophia because if they didn't have $20, they wouldn't have much to live, and the government is not really responsible for the immigrants. They're responsible for themselves. They're on their own, and I would like to say is that, going back to Sophia's . It said that-- then they were fed well, and that they were...\u000a All wanted to get to America, and even if some of them had money, how do you know that they didn't have a disease or something? How do you know if they didn't have lice or something?\u000a I kind of agree with you, because if they paid more, I think they shouldn't get a lot, a lot more, but I think they should get a little bit more, but they still should go to Ellis Island.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Sometimes they did have doctors who came on the ships, and kind of gave the medical exams to First and Second Class Passengers to make sure they didn't have any diseases. And then if their medical exams checked out fine, then they could skip everything else. So they didn't have to get asked all those questions, and they didn't have to wait in all those long lines, and things like that. So what do you think about that?\u000a I think it's still unfair that they didn't have to wait in long lines just because they were already examined on the boat.\u000a I think instead of Ellis Island, they should have checked them before they got on the boat, for everyone.\u000a Yeah. I agree with you.\u000a I think they got all seasick. Think that's where they all got sick?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Like in the Steerage. Some of them got sick because they were in Steerage, and then when they got to Ellis Island, they had to get sent back.\u000a The reason why some of them got sick, was because they didn't have fresh air, and so they couldn't breathe that well.\u000a Stuffy in Steerage.\u000a I think all doctors should have been actually fair instead of sending some immigrants back just because they don't like them, for their religion and stuff.\u000a Could doctors send people back because they didn't like their religion? Doctors could send people back, why? Doctors couldn't send people back, but they would mark letters on your back. Why could they mark letters on your back?\u000a Because they probably thought-- they probably saw something different when it was actually a scratch.\u000a So, just if you were hurt, and then they had to go through further medical exams to see, but doctors couldn't just say, "I don't like you! You have to go back!" They were just examining you to make sure you didn't have a contagious disease that could get other people sick.\u000a When we were reading, they said something about the doctors-- where they didn't have any diseases or anything, but they'd still send them back.\u000a And you read that in the book?\u000a We were reading one of the things.\u000a Oh, and why would they send them back? Why would they get sent back, by the legal inspectors and other people?\u000a Sometimes, it was like there were random reasons they sent them.\u000a Just because?\u000a Yeah.\u000a That's not fair? That's what you're saying?\u000a Yeah.\u000a I'd also change the part where they had to-- why did they have to mark stuff on their own clothes?\u000a Yeah.\u000a I mean they should have given a sheet or something.\u000a Or something. Because, what if that's the only thing they had? You know?\u000a I think they should mark on their skin, or something so then you could just wash it off.\u000a Like a marker or something?\u000a No, I don't think they should do it on the skin, because then if there was a water fountain, they could just wash it off and say, "I'm in this line." Right?\u000a True.\u000a  They could. They could do that. We all agree they should do something other than your own clothes.\u000a They should give you a sheet of paper and--\u000a You could rip it apart. \u000a I think that they way they did it, for example, that guy in the book did his jacket inside-out. They should have been kind of more smart about what they gave them. Because someone could just say, "Take this jacket inside-out," and then go into the other line.\u000a Or he could just put his jacket on tomorrow.\u000a Yeah. "Oh, I don't have a jacket."\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah.\u000a If we didn't have Ellis Island, not as many immigrants would be here, probably, because it'd be a lot harder. And Ellis Island, they fed you food. It was good. I like it.\u000a I agree with Josh because they gave you food and water, a place to sleep. They built stuff and made kinder-cares, and made stuff with the little kids and stuff for the grown-ups. The people that were there at Ellis Island didn't even have to pay for any of that. That was all for free. I mean, imagine that happening to us right now? That will never happen.\u000a I definitely agree with Sophia because if you just come to Ellis Island, and they just give you potato soup every meal, it's kind of like they don't get a good impression of America. I think they try to give a good impression for the immigrants on America, from giving them good food, and a good way to start their time in America. and then they realize how complicated it is.\u000a Yeah.\u000a According to everyone, I kind of agree. It was good, I think.\u000a

V  So how is that energy?\u000a  Different things like jules. Which are increments, which are similar. \u000a  kilowatts hours and BCU\u000a  Okay.\u000a  You could also measure it with a thermometer, if it's kinetic energy sometimes\u000a  Okay.\u000a  I have an cubic feet, tons, and gallons, too.\u000a  That's mass. And volume\u000a  Oh, cause it was like... \u000a  Hold on. \u000a  Totally different thing\u000a  I don't remember \u000a  While she's looking at that, what are some cons of nuclear energy that most people are concerned about?\u000a  Well, there are no  no explosions. That's a totally different process with nuclear bombs and nuclear power.\u000a  Oh, I have...\u000a  And it states, in lots of articles, about nuclear waste, that it produces very little waste. At all.\u000a  Well I have a cubic feet, it's for like, natural gas. Tons is measured for coal. Kilowatts hours is for electricity.\u000a  It doesn't  pollute the air. You could inject the water back into the earth to reuse it. Like you could put the water back in and keep reusing it. And then, the disadvantages for geothermal energy is, the gasses that are released smell bad and efficiency is only 15%, which isn't, it's not that great. And there's a limitation of it. You can't just like keep reusing it and reusing it.\u000a  I think that would  be like a possibility for a scenario, but like, we don't know if it's warm enough to be able to do that.\u000a  Yeah, if there  was a good spot around our area, it might be good but--\u000a  How would you know if your area was a good spot?\u000a  I don't know. They would have to do tests and stuff\u000a  Plus, I don't know that people would want it in their backyard.\u000a  It's hard because, Cranberry, if we're thinking of where those people, well, like a civilized area. People really don't want something--\u000a  That smells bad.\u000a  Yeah, that. They don't want any disruption.\u000a  And where are you most likely going to see geothermal energy come from? There are--\u000a  Inside of the earth.\u000a  Right, but it's inside of the earth, but it comes out in what ways?\u000a  In geysers.\u000a  In geysers, or what else?\u000a  I'm not sure.\u000a  Volcanoes.\u000a  Oh.\u000a  Yeah, so, who, that's definitely something. You don't have volcanoes everywhere either.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Right? And you definitely wouldn't want that in your backyard.\u000a  And sometimes, if there would be a good area, maybe the state, or the country, would buy the property to like put it there, because it's a good spot. Sometimes they do that for like mining and stuff. They like buy the property.\u000a  Okay, Okay. \u000a  I had hydro-electric. And some of the pros that is, it doesn't pollute at all. And the actual running of the power plant is really cheap. And then it's really reliable. So, say there was a big power-outage in the area, the hydro-electric power plant could get that running again. But, it's run by building dams in rivers and they're extremely expensive to build, which can be fixed by partnering up with someone else who needs that. A different, a business or something. But it can also cause flooding upstream for the animals, and people, and houses.\u000a  I have a question for you. Do you have to have like a big river or could you use like a little creek like we have around here?\u000a  I don't think you could necessarily use the creek.\u000a  The Connoquenessing?\u000a  Yeah, but, yeah you have to have like a big river. and it has to be fairly out of the way.\u000a  Would it like cause flooding?\u000a  Yeah, you couldn't have any houses really upstream, because could--they'd flood.\u000a  And for example, your science book says that the Hoover Dam, which is on the Colorado River, it created a waterfall of 400 feet, which is more than twice as high as the Niagara Falls. So you're talking about a river that you would have to be able to create that drop, because the water creates the kinetic energy. Am I saying that right?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  And that's what causes the electricity.\u000a  Correct.\u000a  So, if you could create something like that with the three rivers we have here, that might, that might work.\u000a  And again the whole--\u000a  Yeah, the three rivers, that could do it, because there's a bunch of big rivers in Pittsburgh.\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Yeah, but if you build that up, wouldn't that flood?\u000a  Well, not in the middle of the city, you could maybe do it like out of the city, cause the rivers aren't just like in the city, they go out.\u000a  And also, if you have a good area, flooding wouldn't matter so much, if you pick the right area. Which I mean, I guess, the whole thing...  So definitely not in Cranberry, here. Where we live.\u000a  Well we get a  lot of rain around here, so, I'm just... like flooding would be like a problem.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  We're sort  of in a drought right now, there's not been a big rain for a long time.\u000a  Does it harm the  animals that are in the river?\u000a  It's better for  farmers because down the streams the water is deeper and there's more fish and stuff, but there's less... plants and stuff. Like upstream it floods the animals and homes, and so it doesn't really hurt too much down stream. I guess it depends, because the farmers need deeper waters, but not if there's less life in it. Because that's what they're trying to achieve. \u000a  Rachel tell us about yours\u000a  My energy is fossil fuels. The pros were that it's the most effiecent of most of the energy sources we can use. It's easy to find if you know, in the general area, of where it's at. It makes up half, or more, of our energy, in the United States. The cons are that it's non-renewable. There's a limited supply. It makes a lot of pollution when it's mined. It's expensive to transport. It harms aquatic life with pollution. It takes millions of years to form.\u000a  That's something I didn't know about fossil fuels, that it takes a very long time to develop.\u000a  It has to be, like, compacted.\u000a  Uh-huh.\u000a  So maybe the big plant, it might be able to, not might be able, it would probably run out fast, if we started using it a lot, so there wouldn't be a point in making this huge plant, and then it just run out.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So it might be  something people would use more often in the future. Just little by little, like just for little things. What do you mainly use it for? Like energy, but like...\u000a  What falls under the umbrella of fossil fuels?\u000a  Coals and oils.\u000a  And natural gas.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  And you said it   when you mine it, so we would have to transport it here. There's so many people that live here that wouldn't want that.\u000a  Isn't that what  happened in Mexico? What's that called? The Gulf of Mexico, yeah. Weren't they mining for fossil fuels, like oil?\u000a  Oil, yeah.\u000a  And that happens,  so that's like a natural disaster. And that's happened a bunch of times, so it's not that safe. \u000a  So for our scenario, what do you think would be the best two?\u000a  Maybe nuclear  around here, out of the way a little so it wouldn't create any huge explosions. \u000a  So thermal energy  transfers into electrical energy\u000a  So it's kind  of like biomass, cause they both, you burn both of them, except yours you use--\u000a  Mine's not renewable\u000a  Yeah, yours,  you use like uhm... What's it called?\u000a  Like plants?\u000a  Fossilized  plants and stuff. And for biomass you just use waste or woods scraps and stuff like that.\u000a  Actually, isn't the, isn't the fossilized, or fossil fuels, or whatever, don't they keep on making them?\u000a  Yeah, fossilized,  yeah, but it can't, it takes so long to make them, because you need all the pressure and the decomposing, like plants and animals, that once it runs out, it's going to take a while for us to get more.\u000a  Like thousands of years, it takes to replenish.\u000a  Yeah. \u000a  It takes a long time.\u000a  Yeah, it takes a very long time, for sure.\u000a  So I think,  Keeton, I don't think yours would be the best for our community to use.\u000a  It's running out anyway, yeah, so.\u000a  How much pollution does it cause?\u000a  A lot.\u000a  Why does the world  just use it, if it's running out?\u000a  Why waste it?\u000a  We talked about the efficiency. What's the efficiency cost of fossil fuels?\u000a  I wasn't sure. I couldn't find the exact-- Uh, 38 to 47%.\u000a  That's actually really good. cause like biomass was only 22 to 30 or something.\u000a  So that may have something to do with what your decision is, right? The efficiency of the energy.\u000a  I think so.\u000a  I just . You should save some of it. You don't need to save it but it's not that good of an idea, to rely on this energy source that's not going to last forever.\u000a  That's why I say,  you could also use that as a backup plan, because if we use something that's renewable, like Katelyn's, or something, but something like a disaster happens that could always be our, just our fall back. That we know we could use that if we have to. Just like an emergency generator. It's like, you know it's there, if you need it, you can use it, and it can last for a little bit.\u000a  Since it  is running out, would you guys say that it would be better for us to use it now or save it in case--\u000a  Oh, definitely save it.\u000a  Save it.\u000a  I say save it, too.\u000a  Now I actually  think save it, because--\u000a  I think probably save it.\u000a  I would say to  save it because if something would happen and then you would need to use that specific type then you'll be able to go back to it, but if you use it all, then you couldn't go back to it.\u000a  So, what are you all proposing as your primary energy source?\u000a  Biomass.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Cause it doesn't cause that much pollution.\u000a  And then they  harness that pollution like Katelyn said. They capture it and then they use it for different things, like growing trees or--\u000a  Cause the  only thing that, the only pollution that really comes from it is carbon dioxide. And they have a way of capturing the carbon dioxide and using it to fabricate metal and create paper and use it in greenhouses and stuff.\u000a  Wow, interesting.\u000a  Yeah, I  thought that was pretty good.\u000a  So I think Katelyn's definitely provides the most for the community, definitely out of all.\u000a  Yeah, I   ...have high effiecency rates so you'll be able to get like a lot of usable energy out of it.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a   ...the Colorado River, isn't actually renewable energy's that good of an efficiency rating.\u000a  Actually, actually the... the hydro-electric energy is nearly 95% efficient.\u000a  Wow.\u000a  Once you build it,  since tidal doesn't use any fuel either It's just once you built it, but the down side on building is it costs so much. So, I don't understand why people would want to use that amount of money whenever because you could use that on different things. You could do it to create more biomass. Like if you wanna try to look up ways to make that fossil, plant roots, or plants, just, try to find research to make that happen more quickly. speed up the process, so it wouldn't be a non-renewable resource like fossil fuels or anything.\u000a  There's no, they said, the small streams and like rivers and stuff like that, they only create like a small amount of energy, and so we can't really do that in Silicone Valley... \u000a  What about the three rivers in Pittsburgh? Could we not somehow harness that?\u000a  We were talking about that.\u000a  I was like  talking about redirecting the river.\u000a  Redirecting the river.\u000a  Just making one big one.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  I think that we  would be able to use the three rivers in Pittsburgh, because they're all pretty big rivers, so if we just put like one dam in there, and then we harness the energy from all three, I think that we could get a lot of energy from it.\u000a  I don't think it'd  be enough energy, like to completely rely on it. I think that we'd still have to use other resources, to still create energy because I know the title, it only creates 10 hours of energy a day, but I don't know if that means, like, an hour of that energy runs like a power plant. It didn't exactly say how much energy is used to do one thing. So, I don't, I don't think that'd be a good idea, to completely rely on that, and put it in the three rivers.\u000a  And doesn't then, the, with the title energy, too, there has to be a difference in the--\u000a  The low and high\u000a  Difference in the low and the high.\u000a  Yeah, three meters of low and high.\u000a  Yeah, so where did you, find out where in the world there is that difference?\u000a  Yeah. They  said the biggest title... it was in France or something. But we don't have any in the United States because we don't have an area that we can put it in that has that big of a difference.\u000a  Oh, wow.\u000a  So there's none used in the United States, and I don't think we could use that, then.\u000a  Well, what you were  saying before about how, like, each energy source, we basically have to fall back on another one.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Because none  of them we could completely rely on, to supply all of our energy. I think that we would definitely need at least two choices.\u000a  At least two. And if we had to pick two, I would pick biomass and then your nuclear because you said a little amount takes it a long way.\u000a  Yeah, like  you only need a little bit, and it can produce a lot of energy. And the efficiency rating's pretty high. It's like 35%, so, yeah.\u000a  Wow, that is pretty high.\u000a  Remember you  said it was like really hazardous?\u000a  Yeah, it doesn't produce a lot of air pollution, or greenhouse gases, but if like one small accident is made, then it can cause like a really big disaster, which would be bad for a community of people, since there are so many people in it.\u000a  I think that--\u000a  Katelyn and  Kelsey were talking about like  different kinds of energy sources, and according to issels, uh, issues...\u000a

V  Plug in two. You got it?\u000a  We got it.\u000a All right. First question is... Once energy is used up, it's gone for good. Talk to your partner, no! Let's try that one more time folks, eyes up here. What was the rule on the darts?\u000a The rule is don't do anything until you say so.\u000a Thank you. Don't act until I say so. Go! \u000a Yeah.\u000a There could be a little bit left of potential. Is that what you mean?\u000a Yeah. Well, . \u000a All right. On three. I'm going to need eyes up here, please. One, two, th-- Don't flip your card until I tell you to. I shouldn't be able to tell what your card is. It should be much more secret. They're colored, guys, I can tell what they are. Okay! Here we go, on three, hold up your card please. One, two, three! Okay. We've got mostly disagrees. And then we have very one confident... Oh, we disagree. So here's what we're going to do. Put your cards down. I'm calling on Mark first. So where should we be looking?\u000a  Mark.\u000a At Mark.\u000a Okay. Okay. So I strongly disagree, because say... So you know you... when you... You know how you eat food, you get fuel in your body and you have energy and you go out running. And then you're out of energy, you're tired, you go to bed, you wake up the next morning, it comes back. You eat more food and it comes back.\u000a Okay. So you're getting it from a different source.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, but that energy you have originally. So that initial energy that you have, and then you ran. Does it go away? Yeah, you have plenty more, but does that original energy go away?\u000a No.\u000a Where does it go? Because you still don't have it, right? You have to eat more food. This is supposed to be challenging. Great job. Who has another idea? Or who can tell me where does it go? It's awfully quiet. Awfully quiet. What do you got?\u000a I don't think it literally... Well, I don't think it goes anywhere. You just... It just keeps making more.\u000a It makes more. So the energy I burnt, right? So I'm running, and I'm running, and I'm running. Where does it go?\u000a Out.\u000a Out where?\u000a To the air.\u000a To the air, in what form?\u000a Breath.\u000a Now this is tricky. This is where it gets tricky. Breath is made of what?\u000a Vapor.\u000a Carbon dioxide.\u000a Water and carbon dioxide. And we call that matter. We call that stuff. Is stuff and energy the same thing?\u000a  No.\u000a No, and this is really a tricky idea in Science. So we're going to keep working with you on that. So where does the energy go?\u000a Out into sweat.\u000a Out into... Now, okay, sweat is?\u000a Stuff.\u000a It's stuff, right? But where... So where does the energy go? Does anybody want to change their answer? And say, once it's used up, it's used up for good? Anybody? Some people I think... Now Tatum what do you think?\u000a I think that when you run, it's... Some of the energy go into the ground.\u000a How many people agree with Tatum? That some of that energy is going to go to the ground?\u000a Oh yeah.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay. In what form does it go to the ground?\u000a In static stuff.\u000a What's that? I think you said static stuff. Is that what you say?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, so static stuff is... Now this gets really tricky because now we're getting into electrons. But you're thinking about the rubbing, kind of thinking. Is that what you're thinking? How it rubs? And then you shock people? Okay. So that can happen. That's a little more complicated so I'm going to put that on hold for now. But what... So if I'm running, and that energy's going into the ground, somebody said that. Who said that?\u000a  Tatum.\u000a Tatum. Okay. So Tatum said the energy is going into the ground. In what form is it going into the ground? Yeah.\u000a Energy transfer.\u000a It is an energy transfer, right? This is going from my foot to the ground. What form is it in? Do you guys know what I mean when I say form?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Yeah. We talked about kinetic, and potential, and heat, and what else we talked about? Elastic, and--\u000a Light.\u000a Gravitational, and light, and chemical.\u000a Sound.\u000a Heat, sound. Ooh, there's just hey, is any of that sound energy?\u000a No.\u000a No?\u000a Maybe it could be sound energy.\u000a Yes! Sound! Because you're... You're stepping hard. You're...\u000a Okay, so if I'm running, I'm probably going to produce some sound. Anything else that could go in there? Jason?\u000a Huh?\u000a Okay, I think that as you step on... You'll actually transform some potential energy to the ground because once you step on, you all react to gravity to the ground.\u000a So gravity's pushing down--, now remember what gravitational energy is, is how far it is away from the ground, right? So how much room it has to fall basically. So would there be... If I go like this, would there be any gravitational energy there?\u000a Wouldn't there be if you raise your foot?\u000a Now it's got gravitational.\u000a Here's what we need, I'm really doing something to say... But here's what I want you to think about this one... Actually, let's do this one more time. I want you to re-vote on this. Once energy is used up, it's gone for good. Talk to each other for 10 seconds. \u000a You're thinking it's going someplace else.\u000a I don't know where but I don't think it just disappears for good. I think it's going somewhere.\u000a That it's somewhere but just not sure where.\u000a Yeah.\u000a All right folks, we're going to re-vote on three. One, two, three. All right, put your cards down for just a second. Here's what Henry just said, and I want you to raise your hand if you agree with Henry. And we're going to talk about, again guys, we're not getting answers to all these questions today, we will at some point. I promise. We're going to do it in the formal labs but not before I'm through telling you. Henry, tell me what you just said.\u000a I think that it's not gone for good. I'm not sure where it goes but I think it doesn't just leave. It's still somewhere but I don't know where.\u000a How many of you agree with Henry? That you think that it's somewhere but you're just not sure where?\u000a I don't know where though.\u000a All right. Do you know what form?\u000a No.\u000a No. Anybody else? Know where?\u000a But wait. Doesn't it just transform?\u000a It can transform into something else but then my question for you would be...\u000a  What?\u000a What kind of energy is it? All right, but here's what we're going to do, we're going to move on to the next one. If a person is pushing a box, the person has energy, but the box does not otherwise it would help out. Ready, set, go. \u000a What's the evidence that the box has energy? What form of energy is that, that's moving?\u000a I don't know.\u000a Well, it's kineck, kineck...\u000a One more try.\u000a Kinetic.\u000a Okay. \u000a Because it's currently in motion.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. All right. So now here's what I want... We're going do a challenge question. What about the person? What kind of energy does the person have, who's pushing it?\u000a That... I don't know.\u000a You guys all have it? Okay, here we go! Eyes over here please. Are we a little bit on balancing in agreement? All right, here we go. A person is pushing a box, the person has energy but the box does not, otherwise, it would help out. On three, hold up your cards, please. One, two, three. So what you're saying then is you all think the box does have energy, am I correct?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay. Chloe tell me why... What is your evidence, that the box has energy?\u000a I think it has energy because when you're pushing it, it has a friction with whatever you're pushing it.\u000a How many of you agree that there's friction there? Because it's rubbing against what?\u000a  The ground.\u000a It's rubbing against the ground. There could be some rubbing against you, but most likely it's going to be rubbing against ground. But here's my question, what is your evidence that it has energy? It does have friction, and now it gives you some sort of indication that it's doing what?\u000a  Moving.\u000a It's moving. What do we call that, something's moving? What kind of energy does that? Just shout it.\u000a  Kinetic.\u000a Kinetic. So it has kinetic energy. So here's my next question, so does anybody disagree? The box does not have kinetic energy? Tate?\u000a I didn't believe it. I thought it was transferred. I thought that it was energy transfer.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay. So you think energy's being transferred from the person to the box.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, but the question is still, does the box have energy? Even if I'm transferring it there? Does it have energy while it's moving?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Well, do you mean before the person?\u000a I mean while I'm moving it. I'm in the process of pushing the box. Does the box have energy?\u000a Yeah, but don't you think part of it, would be from you, and part of it--\u000a I think all of it is from you.\u000a Oh.\u000a But does it still have energy?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah, it does. So what's your proof? Chloe just said it. What's your proof that the box has energy?\u000a  Friction.\u000a It's moving.\u000a That it's moving. Okay, now the friction is proof that's it's moving, perhaps. But you also see it moving, that would be the proof that it's moving. Okay, so here's my other question, I'm going to make this point, this is too easy for you. We're going to make this more challenging. What about the person pushing the box? So here is me, this is how I push a box. So if I'm pushing the box, what kind of energy do I have? Think about it. Jack, what do you think?\u000a Kinetic.\u000a How many of you agree with Jack, that I have kinetic energy? How many of you think there's something else going on there as well?\u000a No.\u000a So I have... I can only have kinetic energy, right? Because I am... ?\u000a  Moving. Pushing.\u000a Because I am moving and I'm pushing. Okay. What other kind of energy must I have?\u000a I have to say something else, like it's kind of helping to  and what disagrees. Yesterday, you told us the classic pool...\u000a You're talking about energy transfer? You guys know what she's talking about? We're talking about the pool and handle.\u000a Yeah. I think of it kind of the same thing only the pool hall has some of the  because you have the stick in your hand, and you have the energy, potential energy and then you start moving it, and then it's kinetic and it goes through the stick, and through the ball, and it moves.\u000a So you're saying that I have some form of potential energy as well?\u000a Yeah, before you start. And then .\u000a In what form is that potential energy? Because I think Emily was about to say this, too. Think about this guys. Where am I getting my energy from? Is it gravitational?\u000a  No.\u000a Muscles.\u000a Okay, so I've got my muscles, I've got my body. But where's that energy coming from?\u000a Food.\u000a Which is a form of what, Marcus?\u000a Fuel.\u000a Which is a form of what?\u000a Potential!\u000a Time out. We're asking Marcus. Marcus, what form of potential energy is fuel?\u000a Um.\u000a This is hard. Did you want a lifeline?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Anika, can you help him out.\u000a Chemical.\u000a Chemical, right? Make sense?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Okay. All right, we're going on to the next slide. Are you ready?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Woo hoo hoo. Okay, here we go. Now, goodness, gracious. Okay, this is a hard one. Cold moves faster than heat. Ready, set, go. \u000a And but also I remember my mom on hot days, she's like, "Don't go upstairs because it's hotter." Heat rises.\u000a So is it, is it move... So your evidence that it's moving faster is that it goes up.\u000a Yeah, and also when you put it in hot, hot water, it's looser because...\u000a Okay, so you're saying if cold moved faster it would go up as well?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Faster than heat? Okay. How about moving in other directions other than up? Is there... Do you have any... ?\u000a Wind!\u000a Okay, so that would... So does one move faster than the other?  Tatum, what do you think? All right. Think about it.  All right, here we go.  Okay, here we go. So on three, hold up your answers please. One, two, three. We've got strongly agrees. We've got an in between. We've got an ooh, we've got a strongly agree. And we've got a couple in-betweens. All right. We're mostly in orange land, we've got one green. So here we go? You ready?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a And stand together, you're going to back them up.\u000a Yeah. So, okay, so we agree that. . .\u000a Are you sure?\u000a No. Just kidding.\u000a Because I think the answer you just gave me was certain. So you're a strongly disagree. Okay.\u000a Well, I read it wrong. I thought it said heat... Yeah, I thought it said heat moves faster than cold.\u000a Okay, so tell me why you strongly disagree then, Tim?\u000a Well, because there's just as  heat rises. So it has to be lighter to move.\u000a And so it must be moving faster?\u000a Yeah.\u000a How many of you agreed with this... How many of you thought about this whole heat rising thing? Interesting. And how many of you... Nope, you guys, it never crossed your mind. Okay. Let's hop to another... Tatum, do have anything else to add to that?\u000a No.\u000a What is your evidence that cold moves slower? Because he was just saying heat was rising, do you have any evidence that cold would move slower? Let's see, Alex, what do you think?\u000a Well, because when we did that investigation and stuff on molecules, they move faster when they're hot.\u000a The coke can.\u000a Yeah, the coke can investigation.\u000a Okay, so I'm going to ask them for specific evidence. So what was your specific evidence in the coke can, the hot molec- that they were moving faster?\u000a Well, there was steam coming out of it, and then in the solid, everything's... Molecules in solids are super slow. And then as they move on to liquid then gas, they move faster.\u000a Okay.\u000a And then you need heat to make liquid into gas.\u000a How many of you think that this whole molecules moving faster in a gaseous state proves that heat moves faster than cold? How many of you are kind of stuck on this idea of cold? So let me ask you a question, and I want you to think about it for 10 seconds, then we might move on, let's see. What is cold? Not looking for examples of things that are cold but what is cold? What is the idea of cold or coldness? Okay, think about it for a second. Ellie, what is cold?\u000a Well, it's like... It could be water that's frozen in... I was thinking that heat moves faster than, than cold because if something was frozen, the molecules wouldn't be moving that fast because if they were they could try to push out on that.\u000a Oh, then it might be .\u000a Okay, so she gave me an example of what is cold. But is coldness? So what, what does that even mean? What does that even mean? Anna.\u000a Shivering.\u000a What's that?\u000a Shivering.\u000a Okay, shivering is because you are cold. What is coldness? Okay... \u000a I think it's when the temperature is really low and everything's kind of darkness, when you think of the sun warm, it's really warm, when you have the sun. But it's when you think of something cold, it's... sometimes.\u000a Okay, I want... You guys are giving me some really good examples of what cold is. Here's what I want to think about... Okay, how to phrase this... Is there a such thing as cold? And if so, how would you define it?\u000a It's a hard question!\u000a Oh!\u000a You got to answer! Get ready to answer! Get ready, and do one quick response and then we're going to put it aside for now, and we're going to move on. Come on, Hunter.\u000a No, because it's just heat that's a... That's just water that can be heated or .\u000a Heat, heat is cold. Heat is that.\u000a Yeah, it's like...\u000a Heat, that's cold.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Oh.\u000a So it's all just kind of a scale? Like you got hot over here and cold over here, and you're talking about there's less heat over here than there is here?\u000a Heat has cold molecules.\u000a Heat has colder?\u000a All right. So here's what we're going to do, we're going to talk more about this later. We're going to move on to the next question for now. Here we go.\u000a

V ... the fact that he couldn't do it because he didn't have enough money to do it. What would you do in that situation? Would you try to get money?\u000a Isn't this kind of different because we're all girls?\u000a Yeah, but...\u000a If it was a boy, and he was the one who didn't have money...\u000a Do you feel like the chapters that we read, do you feel like you could tell what Pip was going to be doing?\u000a Kind of. You could tell that he was becoming more stuck-up; wants to change himself and not be around the poor people.\u000a Are you doing the discussion director? Did you do any questions in regards to his-- did you have any direct questions with regards to the text?\u000a Yeah. One of them was like how did Pip change from the beginning of the book to where he's at now, like his character and basically how he acted.\u000a What was the question I missed, Brianna, where you said about the girls? I didn't hear the question. I just heard your response.\u000a His was, in Chapter 29, when he is becoming part of her marriage, he was just like, how would you feel or whatever. None of us really had an answer because the situation is different, like it's different for the guys... She's the one who's like the rich girl.\u000a Who's the recording one?\u000a So, on page 128, paragraph two, that's where Herbert tells Miss Havisham's story. That's important because it kind of explains why she is the way that she is. He explains that you meet Miss Pocket, and then she's kind of like- he kind of explains why she's kind of crazy.\u000a All right. Chapter 8 was interesting because he was home from war and in the camp. He started to treat people. He treated them like they were all heroes.\u000a And he shared the cigarettes with him one time.\u000a He shared the cigarettes with them and was even .\u000a When he was amongst the Russians, he didn't care. They were struggling to survive. He felt sorry for them, which as a connector, I've connected it to- I don't know if you guys have seen "Tears of the Sun."\u000a I have.\u000a And "Avatar." In "Tears of the Sun," he wanted to go and try to rescue people, but he got stuck behind enemy lines , like they're struggling people too trying to gain their freedom. And then same thing in "Avatar." Paul kind of reminded me of how he was behind and he was with the Russians, but he thought that they weren't as bad as he- the military was the only bad part about them. Civilians, he felt sorry for them, that they had to go through all this. They were being killed. Their people were being killed. And they were actually just regular people trying to make it. Everybody was dying because they used all this stuff in the military and they weren't caring about the civilians. \u000a The prisoners?\u000a They were .\u000a They had to trade whatever they had to get like a couple supplies to the refugees.\u000a He started to wonder like why are people higher up, people he'd never met forcing them .\u000a Yeah. \u000a So, then this whole section made me think about that. So, I thought that could be like the controversial part to talk about. This whole section...\u000a Which whole section?\u000a The one you were just talking about.\u000a They're talking about magic.\u000a Yeah. They're talking about the magic and being invisible and then he  and scares them away.\u000a It really showed a struggle between Antonio internally with religions.\u000a Yeah.\u000a In one he had keys and then in the other one it was totally crazy.\u000a Yeah.\u000a That's my next section, is that dream. I think it's page 119. That whole dream is really important because it's like, it kind of highlights what I just said about how he might be the next  person or whatever. He goes to this dream and it's kind of the same thing he's been facing through the whole book- his mom's side versus his dad's side. And Ultima kind of comes out and is like, "Well, you are both. You have to find a happy medium." It's all within the world of his dreams. And then page 139...\u000a One part that I thought was really, really important was his brother at the brothel.\u000a These two chapters, I think they're kind of jam-packed. I just kind of picked stuff that would be good to talk about. And then page 139, paragraph three, they're talking about how the group can be buried in the casket of time. I just felt that was informative and something that we should look at. Just pretty much the whole funeral.\u000a The funeral was good styling.\u000a Like, I don't know, these four chapters...\u000a There was no part where you didn't .\u000a It's like, read these four chapters.\u000a Exactly.\u000a After I read the chapter, I wrote some questions down. The first one is what did the contrast between the golden carp and the black bass- how the golden carp made the black bass jump. And his missing of the bass symbolizes maybe like a win for Abel...\u000a The golden carp story was just very interesting.\u000a The whole controversy is that he's Catholic, but part of him really wants to believe in this whole...\u000a It's not like he wasn't interested in it, but he still didn't believe. But then he still respected the story itself and the respect of the carp.\u000a It made me feel like the golden carp would bring it up. Could Antonio... \u000a It made me feel that Antonio's struggle between his mother's beliefs and his father's, how his father was like, on the corpse-strewn shore.\u000a I remember there was something like when you're in the ocean, it's the same water-\u000a It's like Ultima came in.\u000a She was like, "You don't pick one. You're both. That's it."\u000a You can't just choose one path.\u000a You should be a priest cowboy.\u000a I think the way it was portrayed was like because of the way he was brought up, it was kind of showing the negative. \u000a She's brought up. She's not there, but she's brought up too much.\u000a I feel like she's a goal though, to be like be some kind of spirit type thing.\u000a He hopes that she's like someone who's not fake.\u000a So, I guess he's trying to like make things work with everyone else and see, like, what his relationship with other people and to finally be able to call a .\u000a I feel like he compares all of his relationships to her. He has that standard.\u000a Didn't he point out like all the flaws of her? \u000a That was just creepy. I was just like, "Poor guy," to have all of these weird, awkward dreams.\u000a I'm going to say foreshadowing. I'm sticking by that and saying Ultima's going to die and he's going to be the new... I'm sticking by that, and that's foreshadowing.\u000a Look at you go.\u000a All of those things are foreshadowing or are they just predicting something that happened in the past?\u000a Most of them. Well, I think the one where, remember where he went into a brothel in the one dream? Right. Exactly. So, I think that most of the dreams are foreshadowing.\u000a They're not showing directly what happens, but hints.\u000a Basically I'm a beast.\u000a We don't even have to read the rest of the book because I just gave it to you.\u000a Because we know what's happening.\u000a I said also, in chapter 14, the bad dream, what do you make of it? Is he seeing the sinners as deserters that all witches are being spun out and that he needs to step forward? Or does the golden carp have like stronger power? What do you think it symbolizes?\u000a I think there are good witches and there are bad witches. The bad witches are the ones that should be, like... \u000a That's Antonio's issue as well. I think he's kind of figured out that there's something different about Ultima. I think he's kind of figured out that- he's kind of just like, "Oh, they're evil and she's good. If she's a witch, then she's evil." So, it's kind of this contrast of can a witch be good? It's kind of like the question of what he wants to believe versus...\u000a It kind of relates to the Civil War and the Africans and their personal stuff. It kind of relates to that. The white people, they didn't want to believe that they're intelligent and they're friends. He doesn't want to believe that a witch can be good because he's been told otherwise.\u000a And he's a Catholic and witches are evil.\u000a I think that the golden carp symbolizes perhaps the rebirth.\u000a I think the two most important themes, symbol figures are the owl and the carp. \u000a

V  Dakota didn't want to bring his... because it's all broken.\u000a  Well we can still look at it. Go get it, honey. Actually, Hannah, bring Dakota's petroglyph over, please. Yeah, that's the thing with clay. It breaks very easily. Okay. All right. Will you still be able to tell us about it?\u000a He said that it exploded.\u000a Please don't break it any more. Are you going to be able to talk about it still? You can tell us what was on it. Okay, put it down, Addy, or it's going to break. Okay. So you guys, you did... Your small group was Washoe, and you're going to present to the whole group next week or the next week after.\u000a The whole group?\u000a The whole classroom.\u000a Okay.\u000a Okay. So what I need you to do for a little bit is talk between yourselves about what you found. And the four things that I want you to make sure somebody knows something about: food, shelter, clothing, and location. But if you found something else you want to talk about, go ahead. So anybody, chime in.\u000a Okay. I think I know where they're located.\u000a Can you tell us?\u000a South Lake Tahoe.\u000a  I know what they ate.\u000a In your strong voice though.\u000a They ate onions. They ate wild potatoes, wild carrots...\u000a I think a little bit...\u000a Wild mustard, sunflower seeds, wild carrots, wild potatoes, wild strawberries, raspberries, wild gooseberries, wild rosehips, wild rhubarb, pine nuts, and they used...\u000a Sweet potatoes, wild turnips, wild spinach... seeds...\u000a Okay. Do you think we're good on food?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay.\u000a I think Olivia got the part.\u000a Well, we'll talk about that after. So we have location...\u000a Shelter.\u000a Go ahead. Okay. Who's going to go next?\u000a  I have they used sticks and leaves to build their homes.\u000a Okay. What do you have your information on?\u000a I have clothing. They used rabbit skins, buckskins, and plants.\u000a Okay. And I'm sorry, Coleman. What did you say?\u000a They used sticks and leaves to build their homes.\u000a Okay. So you got those four covered. Any fun facts you guys found? Dakota, what did you find out? Give us one fun fact.\u000a  In 1859 the Washoe... Wait.\u000a Let Dakota, guys. Remember, we're trying to be good listeners.\u000a In 18...\u000a Go ahead, sweetie.\u000a In 1859 the Washoe had about 90 people  times.\u000a Aw.\u000a No, no, not 90, 900.\u000a Can I see what you wrote? They had 90,000, or?\u000a Nine hundred.\u000a Nine hundred, and now they only have 300?\u000a No, let's see. The population. Well I got it off the computer.\u000a Yeah, I got 1500.\u000a In 1855 the Washoe numbered about 900. But are now reduced to about a third of that number.\u000a What that the same fact you had, Dakota?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah, very good. Thank you, Dakota.\u000a I got in 2007, there was 1500. But I got it off the computer too and it said that.\u000a Well, you know the computer is not always...\u000a I got the latest.\u000a What kind of data did you get? Like demographic? Or where did you get yours from?\u000a I got it from Google.\u000a Well guys, 300 was what yours said, Dakota? And yours said 1500?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Are you sure yours wasn't 1500 from before? And now it's 300?\u000a Well it said in 2007.\u000a Okay.\u000a On here, on my brain copy.\u000a Okay. We might need to look at that some more, you guys. We'll look into that before we report on that. But that would be a fun fact anyway. Joe, did you tell us anything?\u000a  Yeah. I have another fun fact.\u000a Okay.\u000a A fun fact. Their houses are called Gadus.\u000a Gadus, okay. Okay. Now who hasn't had a turn, guys? All of you got your hands up. Let's include our little friend, Addy. Okay.\u000a  They made baskets.\u000a Any good baskets?\u000a Mostly Dot So La Lee.\u000a Most famous one.\u000a She was famous for making baskets.\u000a What was she famous for, Olivia?\u000a  She was the... She made the most baskets than other Washoe people, the other Indians.\u000a And why was she more famous than all the other Indians?\u000a I don't know that, but I think she was like a really good basket-maker.\u000a You think she was a good... Can you scoot over?\u000a I can, yeah.\u000a Okay. Did you guys get to see any of the samples of the baskets?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Did you know that they're in very... Oh, you have a picture? Awesome. These are actually Dot So La Lee's baskets?\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a Okay. So the thing, if you every get to see one of Dot So La Lee's baskets, they're woven so tight, you could carry water in them. And we talked about symmetry today in math. They're perfectly symmetrical. Yes, they're woven so tight that you can put water in them.\u000a And even Dot So La Lee had like 2000.\u000a You what?\u000a She had made that many baskets.\u000a She made how many?\u000a A lot.\u000a Two thousand.\u000a Two hundred and something.\u000a Wow. It would be nice to have one of those now, huh?\u000a Yeah. But they're like... You can't even buy them.\u000a You cannot buy them, huh?\u000a They're like in a museum.\u000a They're in museums, but I think some people do have a private collection of them.\u000a Really?\u000a Maybe one or two, yeah. They're not like our petroglyphs that we're going to talk about. Can you have a petroglyph in your private collection?\u000a  No.\u000a Those you can't have. Okay. So you guys, let's see, who wants to be the writer? Do you have a pencil? Grab that pencil. Would you write your tribal name up here? You guys are Washoe. And then go around, Addy, and find out. Write the name of the person next to the food, the shelter, and that's what you're going to kind of be responsible for. Let's get Addy... And you can go around and ask each person, or you can say, "Who wants to do food?" W-A-S-H-O-E.\u000a I'll do fun facts.\u000a I'll do shelter.\u000a I'll do fun facts.\u000a No, I'll do shelter.\u000a Okay. How are we going to decide?\u000a Joe should do the clothing.\u000a Joe should do clothing.\u000a Is that okay with you?\u000a Do you think I should tell you the name of the...\u000a Hold on. We're not doing these. We'll do that later. Thank you, Olivia. Olivia volunteered for food. Joe, do you really want to do clothing?\u000a  I was either going to do clothing or language, because I found a whole thing for...\u000a Everybody can do a fun fact too.\u000a But I was going to do a fun facts.\u000a We need somebody to do food and location.\u000a Okay. I'll do location.\u000a Shelter.\u000a Shelter and location.\u000a I got... I'll get shelter.\u000a Good. Thank you, Coleman. And then, I know you guys want to do fun facts too, so everybody can do a fun fact.\u000a L-E, and then M-A-N.\u000a C-O-L-E-M-A-N.\u000a L-E.\u000a L-E-M-A-N. Okay. Now we just have location left.\u000a But what's Dakota doing?\u000a What do you want to do?\u000a How about me and Dakota will do location together?\u000a Does that work? Okay.\u000a That's who's going to do the fun fact.\u000a Everyone can do a fun fact. So write, "Thomas/Dakota" for location. No, don't worry about fun facts. Everybody has got a fun fact right there. So if both of you are doing it, it's got to be super duper. \u000a Okay, so, we're going to look up if they lived in Washoe. They probably did. \u000a Did you have their names down, Addy?\u000a It's like, Washoe people... \u000a Where are you guys going to find the information, Dakota?\u000a And Dakota.\u000a D-A-K-O-T-A.\u000a Better... You guys, what did we find out about Google? Maybe you want to find two. If you have two things and they don't say the same thing, you might want to check another one.\u000a There's a lot of maps on Google.\u000a There's a lot of maps on Google?\u000a Yeah.\u000a We're going to go... We're going to go on maps and look where...\u000a Okay. Thanks. I'm going to take that so when you... Okay. So next week or the week after, you guys are going to do a whole group, class presentation on your tribe. And you're welcome to bring pictures, or artifacts, or like pieces of whatever, if you want to do that. You can bring a basket. Obviously, it's not going to be a Dot So La Lee.\u000a Can I bring a arrowhead?\u000a Did your tribe have arrowheads?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. Now, looking in front of you, you guys, for our art project we did something. What is this called. Who knows? Olivia? I like how you raised your hand.\u000a The petrograph.\u000a Louder. Petro...\u000a The petrograph.\u000a Petroglyphs. And what is a petroglyph? You're going to break yours, Thomas. Addy, what's a petroglyph?\u000a It's a carving in a rock.\u000a A carving in a rock. Did your tribe make petroglyphs?\u000a We don't know.\u000a Why don't you know?\u000a 'Cuz they put things like right down. They made it. They just moved. They just carved it in and nobody really knows, unless there's someone from that tribe who made it and passed it down, generation to generation.\u000a Yes. Very good. What were you going to say?\u000a You know when we were looking on that website? We were looking on that website ...and one said, "Washoe."\u000a Okay. Yes. So some of them they attri... They say that they did it, but we don't know who did what petroglyphs. But in our state, can we narrow it down to one of four tribes probably? And maybe, if they found petroglyphs where your location was, you could say those were Shoshone petroglyphs? Would that work?\u000a We're Washoe.\u000a Washoe. I'm sorry. All right. So who wants to share theirs first? So what you're going to do is you're going to share it, and show the whole group, and tell us what yours meant to you. Okay?\u000a Okay.\u000a Addy, you want to call on somebody? Since everybody is dying to talk. Who's going first?\u000a Coleman.\u000a Coleman, can we see yours? Okay. I want to zoom in on it. Hold it up a little bit, because I got it up. Okay. What does yours mean to you?\u000a It means that it's night, and there's some stars, and there's a duck. And then there's a canoe on the water. And there is a lot of meat and camping.\u000a Camping. Okay. Anybody else want to go?\u000a Pass it around.\u000a Joseph. Oh, don't pass it around. We don't want to break it. We're going to stick them on wood or something. Oh, let me get a picture. Oh, I'm zooming in. Up higher, Joe, because I've got this on a tripod. Okay. All right.\u000a Mine is we're going to drink some water from a river with fish in it and a duck on top. And there's a snake trying to eat the duck. There's an eagle. It's daytime and the skies are clear.\u000a Oh Addy, you're calling on people. Thank you. Okay. Addy, sit back a little bit so we can see Miss Olivia.\u000a ...random things, but I think I know what it is. It means they're hunting buffalo at night. And then the daytime came and it's all rainbow. And we caught some fish. That's it.\u000a Okay. Good. Who wants to go now? Thomas. Nice.\u000a So there's a camp and there's a little hill behind the camp. And there's people in war, and there's a snake. And then, one person is not in war. He's just trying to shoot a duck. But then the other guy shot him, and then there's... And this has been happening for three days.\u000a Okay. Dakota.\u000a Mine kind of blew up here. Mine kind of blew...\u000a What happened to yours, honey?\u000a It like kind of didn't turn out so well. It like blew up in pieces.\u000a Can you tell us what it was before it blew up in pieces?\u000a Well it was like, I don't know.\u000a Did you have like hunting symbols, or anything?\u000a No.\u000a He just did like squares.\u000a I drew lines because I...  I remember I didn't really know what to write.\u000a You didn't know what to write? Okay. That's all right. But if you could do it again, what would you do? What would it mean to you?\u000a I'd probably make up a war thing.\u000a A war thing? Okay.\u000a It's more war, except hunt.\u000a Hunting? Oh, okay. Did you go, Miss Addy? Okay.\u000a Humans were hunting for humans. That's what's on mine.\u000a Okay. Addy, I would wait until everybody was listening. Thank you.\u000a I can't show your...\u000a Okay. Just show the other children.\u000a It's a sunny day. A snake is trying to eat the fish. The fish are in the river.\u000a Cool. What's the little zigzag?\u000a Mountains.\u000a Oh, those are mountains? Oh, cool.\u000a Sun. Snake. River. Just fishing.\u000a Just fishing.\u000a So, what other kind of art things could we have done to show your tribe? What would have been your tribe only?\u000a Baskets.\u000a We could have maybe tried to weave something. What else?\u000a Basket, but ...\u000a That wouldn't be too fun. In our project, like we could pretend that we were real...\u000a

V Yeah?\u000a I have a question. It says how does the ?\u000a Skip predictions. Move on. Yeah. Olympic athletes--how does your data compare to Olympic athletes? How does your data compare to the class average?  Yeah?\u000a Do we do the predictions? \u000a It does help to have somebody look at it with you. Sometimes it's not as obvious as you think. Scott, we're going to stay on task, right? Good.  We're not doing predictions, right?\u000a No.\u000a So, take a look at patterns. What you want to do for this question is look at patterns. Do you see any patterns there? Okay, good. It's not necessarily worse, by the way. It's definitely different. It's worse, Skye, if you're like dead. If we're talking about heart rate and yours is worse... So, we still have a little bit to learn how that affects you if you are inactive or not.\u000a \u000a So, let's look at the pattern, there. You see that? That's kind of what I was thinking. You just missed that one. Again, one of the things we can talk about then is data collection. Exactly. Come on, let's go.\u000a It's not the same numbers. It's the same pattern.\u000a Right. Good. Any patterns that you guys are seeing back there?\u000a Yeah.\u000a A little bit? What might that be? This is science, be more specific. Are there any patterns for number four? You guys skipped it? It's okay. Yeah. Four. You don't have to do predictions. You compare to athletes. Don't do it for predictions, but do it for your class data and athletes.  Okay. Now, that's a perfect, simple question. Now we take that information and put it into number six. Hopefully you're going to make the mental jump that we need here. What does heart rate have to do with homeostasis? If we challenged our body with a little bit of exercise, you know how heart rates work, now the question is why. How does that keep us alive? There you go. Good. How much more time do we need?  Did you get this one right? If you guys did then you understand the process, hands down congratulations. Make sure you share your answers. Make it quick, I don't want people in and out. We good? How about a drink? Here you go. We got it. It's good. No, I've got it covered, okay? Two more minutes remain in your seats. Number six--there you go. You're good. Good job, Scott. You're very subtle and very helpful. Thank you. Remember, we've got a mic that's on there. All right, got two more. Thirty more seconds, right? Then you're back in your own seats. If you can do six, you're the best. Ten seconds or so. Get in your own seats for the next ten seconds.  Two things are going to happen--we're going to start off with simple answers, then we're going build upon them and then hopefully we'll get to the more creative ones at the end. This class, we have enough time to do that. So, let's do that right off the bat. Question one. Daryl, can you read it or would you prefer to have somebody else read it?\u000a I can read it.\u000a Okay. Good.\u000a "What is the hypothesis being tested?"\u000a Okay. So, let's talk about it. In our experiment, we were looking to get something measured. What is a valid hypothesis for this experiment? Scott we've got and then Alicia. Alicia, let's go.\u000a How does exercise affect your heart rate?\u000a Good. Now, that's a step in the right direction. The hypothesis has got to include the concept-- Alicia and anybody in her group want to help her out--it's got to include the concept of homeostasis. So, can we do that? Can we tale a look at our aim, a look at our model hypothesis--how does exercise affect heart rate? That's a good start. Anybody else have something else different that would support our understanding of homeostasis? You're yawning. You okay? All right. Let's sit up. Thank you. Little bit more. Good. Good. Like you're playing third base, okay Matt? Good. Let's sit back now. There you go. Got it. Anybody else? Go ahead.\u000a If we do exercise then our heart rate will change.\u000a Okay. So, that's kind of what Alicia said. Go ahead.\u000a It should keep going up and then when you're not, it goes down.\u000a Again, a great, great hypothesis if we were at a third or fourth grade level, that's something we want to do. But we're not at third or fourth grade. It's a tenth grade class here. I want you to get out of your seventh grade minds and add this concept of regulation. You want to try?\u000a How does homeostasis affect your heart rate?\u000a "How does homeostasis affect your heart rate?" Think about that, okay? You want to reword that? Which causes which?\u000a Oh, how does your heart rate affect homeostasis?\u000a Good. But now we've got to remember. We combined exercise in this. Kevin?\u000a How does your heart rate change to meet the needs of your muscles and cells in the body?\u000a You didn't use the word "homeostasis," but, "How does your heart change to meet the needs of your cells and your heart in your body?" Excellent. I don't need you to write that. I just need you to understand that's the direction we're going. You want to try now?\u000a I had almost the same thing. I put, "Heart rate changing throughout exercise to the needs of homeostasis."\u000a Homeostasis. Now you guys are closer on it. So, this is about how does your body adapt itself, even when stress with exercise to maintain balance, to maintain homeostasis. In the beginning of this unit, you guys remember I had the balance board up here? How many of you got on it? I forget. One person? Two people? That's it? Three people? Do you remember how hard that was to do? Did we throw things at the people?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Was that easier or harder to stay balanced when that was happening?\u000a Harder.\u000a No, I thought it was like easier.\u000a What's the room for error? How easy is it for one of the sides to touch or how not easy is it?\u000a It's very easy.\u000a Same with homeostasis. That margin of error--we're in a small range here. If I take your temperature, Dustin, and it's healthy?\u000a Not healthy?\u000a Okay. 98.6?\u000a No.\u000a But what if you're 102? What if you're that tell you? You want to try? So, 98.6 is normal. But what if somebody takes your temperature and you're at 100 degrees or\u000a It's not normal.\u000a You want to give me a word for that?\u000a Sick?\u000a You would be sick. You'd have a fever. Something would be wrong with you. You would be not normal, right? Good. That's a small number. 98.6 and if you have 101, you've got to see a doctor or something. You've got to get rest. You've got to get medicine. You've got to do something to help your body heal. All right. Number one, done. Number two and three--Daryl, you did a good job reading the first one. Richie, can I ask you to read the second one?\u000a Sure. What are the controls in the experiment?\u000a Okay. So, controls--another word for controls anybody, real quick?\u000a Independent variables?\u000a No. Not at all. Constants. Things that don't change. So, above the word "controls, " can you guys write the word "constants?" Things that stay the same. So, Savannah, good, good opportunity for you to learn, okay? So, when we say controls, we're talking about the exact opposite of a variable, which is a thing that changes. Everything stays the same or constant. What are some the examples of the constants that you have in this experiment, the controls? Go ahead.\u000a The three categories?\u000a The three categories. We mentioned everybody in the same three categories. Okay. Go ahead.\u000a The amount of time you're giving us.\u000a And how much time was that? Do you remember?\u000a Two minutes?\u000a Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes. The amount of time was the same.\u000a The temperature?\u000a Temperature in the... ?\u000a Stairway.\u000a Good. Because if you were going to talk about your own temperature, actually that changes. Again, that's a whole other topic about homeostasis, that when we exercise, we start sweating, right? So, you're talking about the temperature in the exact place. Okay. Anybody else? Go ahead.\u000a Where we exercise and then the height of the stairs, like if one stair was higher than the other, then it would be harder.\u000a Right. All the steps are the same. Now, here's a control one kid said in my last class and the other kids disagreed with him. He said the exercise was the control, that we all did the same thing.\u000a No.\u000a Do you remember what we did? We walked the stairs. Did we all walk the stairs the same way?\u000a No.\u000a Well, some of you kids hustled, right? Like two minutes, you were like bunnies, like gerbils on the stairway. You were just going crazy. Others were just walking and it was okay. Good. Let's move on. Three, independent and dependent variables. That would be helpful. Thank you for your hand up. We only need one answer of the two and somebody else will give the other one. So, dependent or independent, whatever you want.\u000a Heart rate is the dependent variable upstairs.\u000a Okay, one second. One second. So, tell me a little bit more, though, Daryl. Is it heart rate and how do we measure the heart rate? Take a look at your graph. Your dependent variable is going to be very well described on your graph. Help me out. Go ahead. Okay. You're looking at it. Somebody want to help him out? What is the dependent variable of this? He's close, but he's not close enough to be right. Savannah?\u000a Number of heart beats per minute?\u000a Per minute. You had to have the per minute on that, okay? That's the standard that we use in science. Independent variable--Kelsey, would you like to try?\u000a I'm not sure I know it.\u000a Okay. That's okay. What did we introduce in this experiment to affect our heart rate to see if we could stay balanced?\u000a Exercise?\u000a Bingo. So, your independent variable?\u000a Exercise.\u000a Exercise. Two minutes of exercise is what we did. Very good. Your back group, you have another one or it's all up here? Okay. Four, how does your data compare to the Olympic athletes? How does your personal data compare to the class? Now, remember, we're scientists. So, you just can't say, "It went up and then it went down," or whatever. You can say that, but it's got to be justified with some sort of specific numbers. Richie had his hand up first, okay Justine? Okay. Go ahead.\u000a My heart rate predictions were very low because I didn't have any idea and then my actual heart rate was higher than the Olympic athletes because they're used to running a lot.\u000a Okay. Here's a good example of what I'm talking about. First of all, what you did with predictions is great. We didn't actually have to even do that one for this question, but that's great. Richie, when you say they were higher, what do you mean? Your resting rate was higher? Your post exercise rate was higher? Your recovery rate was higher?\u000a All of them.\u000a Okay. You've got to include them in your answer. You have to include that in your answer. You've got to be specific. Go ahead, Matt. Margaret, you're next, okay? Yeah. Go ahead.\u000a My prediction, I had low numbers, but after doing the experiment, only one of my numbers was lower than the Olympic athletes.\u000a Okay. So, again, what was that one number?\u000a Post-exercise.\u000a Post-exercise was lower. Wow. That's rare, by the way. Did you see the class data compared to you, then? We weren't supposed to do the prediction, but I'm getting so many hits here. How many of you to a look at your prediction compared to other people? Quite a few people. You guys when you were doing this, you asked me, "What's the normal range?" And I didn't tell you. I wonder what you would say your prediction is after I gave you a range. I purposely didn't just to let you see, just like you said, "Mine was off because I didn't know any better." Good. All right. Five--super important question here--oh, I'm so sorry, does anyone else want to contribute to the Olympic athletes? I'm so sorry. Go ahead.\u000a My actual heart rate was higher than the Olympic athletes, but for the exercise one, it was only seven heart beats lower.\u000a Okay. So, what does that mean to you? How close to an Olympic athlete are you is what I'm asking.\u000a I guess it could be exercise. Like with the Olympic athletes, I know it wouldn't be like anything for them. For me to be like that far off is kind of like impressive.\u000a Right. And how would you know that? Didn't you say you had like a cousin who...\u000a Does crew.\u000a Does crew at the Olympic level or just does crew?\u000a She does crew at an Olympic level.\u000a Wow, a premiere athlete, then. Fantastic.\u000a What's crew?\u000a Crew is when you row a shell or row a boat. There's singles, doubles and quads.\u000a Oh yeah.\u000a Fantastic. Anybody else before we move on? Christina and then Scott.\u000a I noticed that we're just like, like I realized we're all, like, the same because when the Olympic athletes went up, class average went up and ours went up, so I noticed it was the same pattern, just like depending on what we were doing it was different than the Olympics and all that stuff.\u000a That's the big picture I want everybody to see here. Take a look at your graphs one more time. Do you agree with what Christina just said? Forget about your prediction number. Did you see that there's a pattern here? No matter who you are as an individual in this class or as a class average or as Olympic athletes, when we exposed our body to exercise, what happened in all cases?\u000a It went up.\u000a So, we would say it increased. Okay. What happened when we rested, post-exercise? Yes?\u000a It decreased.\u000a It decreased. Right. So, there is a general pattern. Excellent job, Christina. Go ahead, Scott. Make it quick.\u000a I had the same thing as her.\u000a Okay. Good. All right. Key question--if we can answer six, we've got this lesson down pat. When muscles are active, cells use nutrients and oxygen at a higher rate and produce waste, chemicals and heat more rapidly. What does heart rate, how does heart rate demonstrate regulation/homeostasis in the body? I've got three hands up. I didn't see the order. I'm sorry. So, I'm going to go four or five hands up. I got one, maybe two, I don't know, Gabby, three, go ahead. Richie, if someone leaves something out, it's yours.\u000a When you're exercising, like, you're using more nutrients and oxygen so the blood has to carry more nutrients at a faster rate so your muscles get it. It does that to maintain homeostasis. So, it's, like, using it constantly.\u000a Okay. Daryl? She did a good job. I'm going to change the question for you. What if your body didn't do that? What if you're running up and down the stairs, Daryl, and your heart rate didn't increase?\u000a It would have a hard time maintaining homeostasis.\u000a Okay. Excellent. And what would happen? What do you think?\u000a You'd be dehydrated and wouldn't sweat or anything.\u000a Well, I don't know if you'd be dehydrated.\u000a You wouldn't get as much oxygen because it wouldn't be working as fast and you wouldn't be like... So, it might get stuck in there while you're running up and down...\u000a

V Welcome to our kindergarten classroom. The library is the heart of our room where books are labeled and sorted by genre and reading level to facilitate student self-selection. This is also where we display author studies, current student work and student-made literacy charts. This is where we have our writing center, more level texts, classroom volunteer supplies and a lending library. Math work is on display and student portfolios are organized and easily accessible. We have a few tables to facilitate guided instruction and small group learning. Our schedule and calendar are housed in this part of the room and we have a message board which is portable and used for modeled and interactive reading and writing. Our learning center's chart organizes student movement around the classroom and our word wall houses high frequency words and rich tier-2 vocabulary words. "But on the morning of the fair, the little calf was nowhere to be found. She had wandered down to Mud Pond by the cornfield to cool off. When she waded into the muddy water, her feet sank. With every step, she sank deeper and deeper and deeper. The little calf was stuck in Mud Pond." "'Get the hands! Get the helpers!' the farmer shouted when he saw her. All the farm hands came running with their ropes, but the more they tugged, the more stuck the calf got. 'Get the big yellow tractor!' the farmer shouted, 'He can save her. ' But the big tractor just scared the little calf. She sank deeper and deeper. And nearby farmers began to gather around." Readers, I think we've come to our problem in the story. I think the characters, Otis and the calf, have a big problem. Talk to your partner and see if you can figure out what the problem is.  Readers, I heard a lot of good ideas. I heard a lot of good discussion. Miami, what's the problem?\u000a \u000a Who sank into the mud? The baby cow. It's called a calf. Oh my goodness, readers. I heard everybody's discussions. You guys were all talking about the big problem--the calf is stuck in the mud. Help me write that in the problem box. Here we go.\u000a  The calf is stuck in the mud.\u000a That's our problem. The calf is stuck in the mud. Let's see what effect this problem is having on the characters in the story. Let's see how they're feeling now. It tells me where to stop to ask you guys questions. "'Call Fire Chief Douglas and the fire truck!' the farmer shouted. 'They can save our little calf. ' But the sight of the big red fire truck startled the little calf into the mud even deeper. The farmer was fit to be tied. If the farm hands and the big tractor and even Fire Chief Douglas and his fire truck couldn't save the little calf, who could?" Oh my goodness. Look at everybody. What effect is this problem having on the calf and the farmer and the community? How is everybody feeling? I like Amir's raised hand. How is everybody feeling, Amir?\u000a They feel sad.\u000a Sad. I heard you say another good word that started with W...\u000a Worried.\u000a Worried. They're sad. They're worried. How else are they feeling? Sad, worried.\u000a Scared.\u000a Scared. Scary--what if they can't get her out?\u000a Scary.\u000a  ...call a lot of people.\u000a Yeah. They're in panic mode. They're trying to call everyone. They're panicked. Frightened.\u000a Afraid.\u000a Afraid.\u000a Worried.\u000a Worried. So, so worried. So, so worried.\u000a They might call the other tractor.\u000a The big tractor can't get her out. He already tried. Wait, Kanye, were you talking about the other tractor?\u000a The red one.\u000a Oh, they might call Otis. Maybe Otis could help. That might be a good solution to the problem. Let's see what they do. Let's find out. "Suddenly the little calf's ears perked up. Over the hum of the growling crowd, there came a faint sound in the distance. A soft, rhythmic purr, 'Put, put, puttity, chuck. Put, Put, Puttity, chuck. Put, Put, Puttity, chuck. ' The crowd turned and looked." You hear the word chuck. Who is coming?\u000a Otis.\u000a Otis. Good. Let's see what happens. "The sound became louder. 'Put, put, puttity, chuck. Put, put, puttity, chuck.'" Let's all make Otis' sound.\u000a  "Put, put, puttity, chuck. Put, put, put, chuck. Put, put, puttity, chuck."\u000a "All at once, Otis put-puffed from around the barn. He turned and he headed straight for Mud Pond." "Otis put-puffed down the rolling hill and pulled right up next to the muddy waters' edge. The calf heard her friend's puttering purr and bawled. It was almost like, Hello!\u201d She's crying out to Otis. Yeah. She bawled. "To the sound of his gentle chuck and to the amazement of all the people in the crowd, Otis slowly began to circle the pond. He circled and he circled and the little calf turned and turned, never taking her eye off her friend." It looks like they might be solving their problem. "With each ring Otis made around Mud Pond, the muddy grip loosened until the calf was able to stumble out of the pond on her own. The two friends had found each other again." It looks like we found a solution to our problem. Talk to your partner about how they found a solution. How did they solve their problem? \u000a I heard a lot of good discussion. How did they solve their problem? You guys, I heard everybody talking about it. So, Jabrielle, how did they solve their problem? What was the solution? Who came and got her out of the mud? I heard you tell Isaiah.\u000a Otis.\u000a Otis. Ramaya, how did Otis get her out of the mud just like Jabrielle said?\u000a He rided around the mud...\u000a Oh, I don't know if you can hear Ramaya. She said Otis rode around Mud Pond and got the calf out of the mud. Help me write that.\u000a  Otis rode around Mud Pond.\u000a It was called Mud Pond. Otis rode around Mud Pond.\u000a  And he got the calf out of the mud.\u000a That's the solution. Now how is everybody feeling? What effect is this having? How do they feel now that they have their problem solved? Nijyah?\u000a Excited.\u000a Excited. Miami? Happy? Sherod.\u000a Glad.\u000a Glad. Edward? Yeah. They're feeling great. They're reunited. Their family is back together. Zion? How do you feel when you solve your problem? They are a little exhausted, aren't they? That was a lot of work. Ismail? They're feeling okay. They're feeling relieved. Relieved. Wow. Great job. Let's see how the story ends. Readers, you are really doing a great job paying attention to the problem and the solution of the story. It's really helping us comprehend the story better. We're understanding it really well. "Otis led the calf right down the dusty road toward the village and everyone threw flowers as they went, following them into town. It looked like a happy parade. No one needed a fancy-- No one needed a fancy blue ribbon to tell them that the calf was a special calf." "Otis was a special tractor. And the two of them were special friends. From that day on, the farmer discovered that with Otis' puttering purr beside the chicken coop, his chickens laid more eggs. At milking time, with Otis' gentle chuck nearby, his cow produced more milk. And on occasion, Otis even got to join the farmer and the big yellow tractor out in the fields. But often, at the end of the day, Otis would just sit with his friend under the apple tree and watch the farmer he loved."\u000a

V All right, so we're going to need someone from all the groups to kind of summarize for us.\u000a Grace?\u000a Guys, raise your hands. \u000a So I figured... okay, you guys should . All right, I need everybody on the floor, and you two groups sit right here, okay? Everybody's on the floor, criss-cross applesauce, in five. Five, four, three two... and one. Okay. I need you to stay where you are and just turn around, and I'll just have the people come talk to me, and they'll talk to you, all right? We're going to start with... let's see. We're going to start with group one, all right? People from group one, raise your hand. Okay. Will you girls come up and tell me what you guys talked about? And I'm going to listen.\u000a Our question was, select three characteristics that you think is most important for school and tell why. So we had our score card, and it said stuff. So then the first one we did was my manners, because if you're nice, that means that you're polite, and then you get more friends.\u000a All right. Next?\u000a Following directions, because you won't have good behavior and you won't do good on a test if you don't follow directions and you don't do, like, your study guide, or study, then you won't do good on a test. And our last one is behavior in class, is because behavior is sort of like not listening, because then you probably won't listen if you're just doing, like...\u000a All right. Thank you. Now tell us, everybody, we're doing this, and everybody can answer. So how do you think that relates to a job? Behavior? Yes.\u000a If you have good behavior, then you'll get somebody to hire you, because you can work good.\u000a If you have good behavior, most likely you'll get hired, because you . Anybody else? Nobody else? Yes, ma'am.\u000a Um... it's sort of like what they said, but if you have good behavior when you're working your job, you won't get fired.\u000a Okay. You won't get fired. And, you know, good behavior is one of those things such as coming to work on time, okay? If there's nobody there to work your position, then your teammates have to pick up the work, or the work doesn't get done. Okay, group two, let's see. Lauren, go ahead, come up and read your question and answer, please.\u000a What is a non-traditional career for a male and a female? And, um...\u000a Go ahead.\u000a We wrote for a male, a fashion and a nail designer.\u000a That's right.\u000a And then for a female, a pilot and a car designer.\u000a Good, good. Can someone... thank you. Can someone give me some more ideas about some things...let's see. I'm going to call...I'm looking at colors. I'm going to pick somebody with this color on. And you can take your jacket off, and I'm still going to call your color, if it's your color, red. Give me a job that you think might be a non-traditional career. One for a woman. What did you... I mean, you can use the video as an example. You want to think about it?\u000a Construction worker.\u000a A construction worker as a woman. My color's red. Yes, sir.\u000a For a woman or a male?\u000a It could be for a male or female. Or you can, it doesn't even matter. Skyler.\u000a For a girl, maybe a football coach.\u000a For a female, definitely a football coach. If you guys watch Glee,  you see the football coach is a male, a female. And so, yeah. But now, Sakwan, we're going to go with you last, and then I'm going to go to group three.\u000a Um... for a male, probably a teacher?\u000a A male as a teacher. Exactly. So let's have Grace... not Grace.\u000a Alex.\u000a Alex.\u000a Mallory. Mallory, do you have a V under your name?\u000a Yes.\u000a You're from group three? So let's, let me read yours, and you guys answer. You can stay there. Let me read it, and you guys answer. So group three was, using what you have learned about non-traditional careers, what would you say to someone when they say that a boy can't do a job, or a girl can't? And I will just let you guys read.\u000a I would say that it doesn't matter if you're a male or a female, as long as you like your job and you can do your job well. Nobody can tell you that you can't do something just because you're a boy or a girl.\u000a Good. Does anybody disagree with that one? No? Does anybody agree with that statement? Okay. All right. Sakwan, come up, do, you guys are going to do number four, and we're going to move to the next activity.\u000a Our question is, what plans do we have for being successful in schoolwork? We wrote, do your homework, follow directions, paying attention, being respectful, good grades and not shouting loud. And the  oh yeah. And don't have some, like, yelling or, like, stealing things, like...\u000a Report cards.\u000a Yeah, but, no.\u000a \u000a Yes.\u000a Well, we did a couple, like, . Writing is a little challenging. Reading, easy, some books.\u000a Okay. So they went with the idea of, you know, not too easy, not too hard. Good. Thank you. Now what we're going to do now is we're going to do some research on non-traditional careers. Now, some of you will be where the purple papers are. Some of you will be where the white ones are. And it's just so that you guys will be able to talk about this later and say, okay, this is what I experienced on a policy job, and this is what I experienced on the other one. So everybody point your attention to the front, and I'm going to go through one of the worksheets with you. I'm going to go through the harder worksheet with you, okay? Just point your attention to the front. And I'm going to go through this one with you, because this one is the hardest one, and then all the other ones are the easier ones. Okay, the worksheet that we're going to do today is going to tie in what you guys talked about with careers, subjects. When do you all get report cards?\u000a We got it yesterday.\u000a You got them yesterday. What I want you to do is I want you to think about your report card, your favorite subject, whether it be English, math, science, social studies, whether it be PE, art, whatever it is, and I want you to pick from this site. You see this site? It says www.bls.gov/k12/, okay? I want you to pick from that site your, what subject you did the best in, or what your best interest is. There are some of you, I know somebody here likes nature. They will pick nature, and in that job, if it's a boy, he's going to pick a job that he thinks mostly females have. Who thinks they can give me an idea of what job mostly females have? Molly?\u000a Maybe a veterinarian.\u000a A veterinarian. Most veterinarians I've seen have been female. So I would go there. And if I was a boy, I would read through this sheet. On this sheet, it has some questions. It says how to get ready. You'll find that tab, and you'll give me a summary of how they get ready for this job. It says what is this job like. You read that, and you'll give me a one or two sentence summary of what the job is like. And it says, are there other jobs like this? That's to the bottom. And you can write those jobs down. Another one says, what about the future? And you'll write a one or two minute summary of that section. Also, we have some reflection questions at the bottom of this worksheet, and the reflection question is, one is, what did I learn about careers? The other one is what's a non-traditional career, and the last one is what did I learn about myself? So make sure you answer all those questions in the worksheet. Now, if I was a girl and I went to nature, what job do you think I would pick Alea? What job do you think most boys have that's over here for nature?\u000a Zookeeper?\u000a Maybe a zookeeper. So the object of this is to do research in the area that you find most interesting. Is this what I have to be when I grow up, Mr. Nealy? No. You just have to do research in that area. So the big important part is to have research done in that area, just so that you can explore different jobs. And I think, was it group three that had that question?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Group four that had the question about what would you tell somebody? Who had that question?\u000a Us.\u000a Group three had that question, and I think you guys gave a pretty convincing argument. Okay, I'm going to tell you who's going to sit at the purple stations. If you're sitting at a purple station, you're going to click yes, you want sound. And your worksheet is already there. And I want us to compare and contrast the different information you get from the two worksheets. Okay, purple station. Skyler, go to a purple station. Mr. Y-...\u000a

V What are some other indicators that tell us, "I'm in my target heart rate range?" Yes.\u000a  By the categories on your RPE chart.\u000a Okay, your RPE Chart, you could use that. That's exactly right. How about within your body? What's something that your body can tell you that you're in that target heart rate range? Yes young lady.\u000a  Um, the way you breath and how you're feeling.\u000a Okay good, your breathing, your feeling, some of you want to come in here and work out and then talk about how that your legs startin' to hurt and your thighs are startin' to be sore. All those things are physical ways that your body's sayin', "Hey, I'm doin' a good job "in this workout, I'm within my target heart rate range." When we do this today, I want you to kind of take a mental picture. Let, take a mental picture of, "This is how my body feels "when I'm in my target heart rate range." Whether your lower end or higher end, take a mental picture so that when you're out walking or, not walking, but when you're out running or playing soccer or playing basketball or things like that, you can kind of have an idea how you're feelin' with those, with those things, and you can know whether you're close to being in your target heart rate range. Now, one of the last things is, is we filled out that family health history that each of you has there and some of you had some different things on that health history, from heart disease, to high blood pressure, those types of things. The cardio workout that we're doin' today, what areas is that gonna positively impact on that family health history for you? Who knows that? What are some of those areas? Okay, Let's get you there Amy.\u000a  It'll help prevent heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes.\u000a Okay, the heart disease, that's exactly right. Good cardio, high blood pressure, it's gonna bring the blood pressure down. Also, diabetes. Along with high blood pressure, you got high cholesterol. All of those areas, cardio, is going to positively impact those areas. Okay? The, yes?\u000a  What do I need to lose weight?\u000a Okay, to lose weight. That's a question I get a lot of time. If you want to lose weight, ideally, you want to be in the upper end of your target heart rate range, or about 80%, however, you do actually at about you do burn more cal, fat calories at about 60%, but you're gonna burn more calories at 80% because it's a more intense workout, okay? So really, ideally, you'd want to be within your target heart rate range. Typically, up towards the higher end will be a little better because, if you're gonna be able to burn a few more calories than at the lower end. Okay? Any other questions on anything? All right, we're gonna get started here. You've already got your target heart rates, there. I want you to look here, and I want you to send that text to this poll everywhere to where your target heart rate zone is. What is your zone? And we'll notice this, most of you, you know, we've all figured it out. You'll notice percentage wise where most of you are gonna stand, or where most of you are gonna be in the chart. We start all the way down at 100, go all the way up to above 176. You'll start to see, that, that most likely that 151 to 175, that's gonna be our biggest area here that we're gonna fall into. You can see right there, we're at 75%, So most of you in here, where's our target heart rate range? In between?\u000a  Between 151 and 175.\u000a There you go, between 151 and 175. That is right on the money for young adults your age. If you're at that 176 or higher, that's not a problem, but that is an area where, you know, anything over about 185 or so, then it just means that you've got to bring your heart rate up a little bit higher compared to most people. So most people though, again, are gonna be in that 151 to 175. That's a good job. Okay, go ahead and go to your machines here. Lay your clip boards off to the side. If you want to listen to your ipod or to your music, you can, only one ear phone though, only one ear piece. Make sure you put your cell phones up in the cubby there, we'll do something with those a little bit later. And where we're gonna start with here is we're gonna start together. We're gonna start with a two minute workout. On this workout, two minute warm-up. All we're gonna do is get warmed up. You need to be out on the bike, somewhere around 40 rpms. Ellipticals, about the same thing, 35 to 40 rpms. On the treadmills, around three speed will be a good, good place to start with. Is everybody good, we ready to go?\u000a  Yes. Are we good back there? You all set? Okay, all right, here we go. Startin' on two minutes. And start. All right so make sure that we got those magnets on there. Bump that up to about three or so. Just to get warmed up.  This is just gonna get your heart rate up a little bit. Now at the end of this warm up, we're gonna check where your heart rate is, we're gonna check that and you'll notice it will be a little bit elevated compared to, compared to, you know, what it was for a resting heart rate. You most likely will not be though, in your target heart rate zone, right here after this warm up.  About halfway through. Good job. Anytime you work folks, you should always do a warm up. Now we've already stretched and done some, a little bit of jogging down there in the gym before we came up here. So you've got some warm up but anytime you go to a fitness room, you want to make sure that you do a little bit of warm up. Don't jump right in to it. You're gonna have a tendency to pull some muscles and have a lot more soreness and injury risk, for you. Good job, everybody doin' good?\u000a  Yes.\u000a As we do this, I'm gonna come along and ask you where you are on your RPE chart periodically, 'Cause I want to know how your body's feeling. Just kind of look at that and gauge where ever you are. Okay? Let's go ahead and get a heart rate check, here. Real quick, put your hands on the sensors, let's get that heart rate checked. As soon as you get that heart rate check, go ahead and stop your machine, hop off and we're gonna record that under heart rate one, real quick, under the warm up. Okay, stop your machine there. Record that heart rate.  As soon as we get this, go ahead lay those back off to the side, we're gonna hop back over here and we're gonna start goin' through the workout. Now the workout's gonna be 10 minutes. Again, bikes, you outta be pumpin' out about 80 to 85, of your RPMs there. Ellipticals, probably somewhere between 70 and 75. We really want to try to push this so at the five minute mark you're within that target heart rate zone. Anybody right now in their target heart rate zone?\u000a  No.\u000a No? A little bit elevated from the resting though?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Okay, all right. Let's go ahead and start.  At the five minute mark, we will check it again and we will check that heart rate, what your heart rate is. We won't get off the machines again until the work out's over.  Caroline?\u000a  Now again, on your own, once we get into this a couple minutes, on your own, if you want to kind of gauge where you are and check those sensors, you're more than welcome to do that. You just don't want to do it the whole time you're working out, and that'll kind of give you an idea where you're standing. If you need, if you're below your lower end of that target heart rate, go ahead and bump up the resistance a little bit, if that's the case, as we continue on through this.\u000a  Are you all doin' good? Where are we on the chart? At 3? That's good.  You all could do this for an hour, huh? There you go.  How you doin' over there? Where are you on your chart?\u000a Two.\u000a That's good.\u000a Three.\u000a Three.\u000a Two.\u000a I'd say around two.\u000a Two.\u000a Two. Ladies, how we doin' over here? How you feelin' on your chart?\u000a  Three.\u000a Three?\u000a Yeah.\u000a You good, Russell?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. Andy, how you feelin? Where are you, on your chart? About four? How do you feel, good? Where are you on your chart? Doin' good. Most of you, you're all about a two, three, four range right now. Now we're just getting to the start of the work out, but here in a few minutes, that's probably gonna change. Might be changing right now. Probably startin' to feel a little bit of fatigue, breathing's becoming a little bit more difficult. We're gonna do a heart rate check in two minutes. Again, remember, I want you, mental picture in your mind, "How is my body feeling when I'm in "that target heart rate range?" Doing a good job, good job.  Okay we got one more minute and we're gonna get a heart rate check, here.\u000a  If you're feelin' like your in that 4 to 6 range, you might be able to go ahead and up your, up your intensity just a little bit there, up your speed maybe, up your resistance a little bit. Russell, did you forget to put your phone on vibrate?\u000a Yeah.\u000a That's all right, buddy. Just don't mess with it while you're on the bike, okay? I mean while you're on the treadmill.\u000a Okay.\u000a Okay, hard to do, hard to do anything with a phone while you're running. All right, let's go ahead and get a heart rate check here. Get a quick check. Remember what this number is. This is gonna be heart rate number two on your chart. We want to be within that range now. If you're not, we need to up your resistance. If you're at the lower end, I want to try to get on up towards the higher end, about that 80% mark. So if that's the case, bump your speed a little bit, up your resistance if you need to. We're gonna get one more check here in about four and a half minutes. \u000a About 65, I'm in my range.\u000a Nice, nice.  Where are you on your RPE chart?\u000a Uh, about four.\u000a About four? Four or five?  Hey, anytime, you know if you're saying, "God, I just can't get my heart rate up there," if you're on the treadmill, increase that elevation a little bit. Elliptical, if you increase the resistance, then you'll start to feel it. How's Callie back here? She's startin' to get it right now, aren't ya?  How are you all on your chart? Five or six? Where are you all on your chart?\u000a  Five.\u000a  Five?\u000a  Six.\u000a  Where are you guys on your chart?\u000a  probably around four.\u000a Ladies how we doin'? Where are you on your chart?\u000a  About six.\u000a  Six?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  How are you, Russell?\u000a  Six, seven.\u000a How about you?\u000a  Six.\u000a  Six?\u000a  Dale, where are you?\u000a  Three, four.\u000a  Three, four? You need to increase your resistance, I mean your elevation a little bit. How about you?\u000a  Four?\u000a Four.\u000a Most of you are comin' up on that chart. Comin' up! Okay, we're gettin' ready to do another check here. Good. A couple more minutes here. Everybody doing okay?\u000a  Yup.\u000a Are you startin' to feel some of the signs we talked about, fatigue in the legs?\u000a  Yes.\u000a I know it's hard to talk right now. A little more difficult breathing.\u000a  Startin' to feel it a little bit more now, aren't you?\u000a  yeah, a little bit. \u000a  How's it going back here? My legs are like rubber . So now you know, you just got increase that resistance a little bit and keep it at the same RPMs.\u000a One mile, Kyle.\u000a  Okay, in thirty seconds here, we're gonna get a heart rate check. Then we're going into the cool down. You really push it right here. You're about to jump off the elliptical, aren't you? Good. Okay, let's get a heart rate check here. Heart rate check. Grab those sensors. Remember this number. When you get this number, when you've got this, go ahead and bring your speed on down.  We're goin' into the cool down phase. Make sure you remember what that number was.\u000a  What was your heart rate?\u000a  Uh, 170.\u000a  I'm about 169. \u000a  In your cool down phase now. There you go, good good. Did we get in there, in your range, in your range? Everybody in your range? Great, good job. Did you stay in heart rate range? Good. Now did anybody on that RPE chart ever feel like you got up to about an eight or a nine?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  You did?\u000a  Yes. Up there? All right. Did ya'll get in your range?\u000a  Yup.\u000a  Did you get within your range? Was ya'll on your upper end or towards the lower end?\u000a  Upper end.\u000a Tried to go up. How about you guys? Did you get in your range there?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Yeah. Now, here in about 45 more seconds, we're gonna get our last check here, on the cool down. You'll notice how quickly as you do this, you'll be able to tell a major difference from the last check that you did during the workout, and even after this two minute cool down here, the difference  between where that heart rate drops to. Are ya'll okay? Okay, let's go ahead and get that last heart rate check.\u000a

V  Inner circle number two. Again, this was a question that was asked in a multitude of ways and this is where we're going with this: Why did the accident happen? The accident of May 10th, 1996. Why did it happen? Any questions?\u000a \u000a Yes, the May 10th, 1996, thank you for clarifying, where everybody died, well not everybody, but a lot of people died. Why did it happen?\u000a  Because...  \u000a Okay, so, I think the reason the accident happened was maybe those people just weren't prepared for for the climb. They thought it was going to be they're just going to go up with a guide and some other people they were just going to go to the top and come back down and it was gonna be an easy thing and they didn't expect the challenges that they were going to face.\u000a  I agree. They probably thought it was gonna be a walk in the park. Turns out that they weren't ready and it was no cake walk and it turned out that some of them it was their last day on the mountain.\u000a  You were talking about they weren't prepared and all that. But they also said that the guide had never been through a storm like that and that that wasn't normal. And I was kind of taken aback by that, because I was like, if there's a guide who's going to be guiding me on a life-threatening thing I would want them to be, seasoned trainer you know...\u000a  Exactly, I would think the same thing. That the guide should be prepared for that kind of storm unlike how he was and it turned out fatally for the rest of the crew.\u000a  I agree with all of you, but during reading the article, Krakauer also mentioned that he said that it wasn't really anyone's fault... because people were so... not in their right minds. They were tired and injuries and how thin the air was, they couldn't breath very well So when they looked at the sky and saw the storm coming,  they didn't expect it to be as bas as it was, so nobody could really prevent it. Anything to add to that? \u000a I agree, and I think that they were just having so much fun that they weren't really paying attention. \u000a  I think that they would've all been prepared if they had been watching the clouds...  \u000a  I know you mentioned the clouds but why weren't they watching them? Why do you think they weren't watching them?\u000a  ...they didn't think that they were actually serious enough to actually \u000a  I agree with Matt, that they were so... they wanted to get to the top so much they weren't too worried about looking at the clouds, 'Oh okay, we can make it back up and  make it back down, maybe before.' Not expecting  trouble along the way. \u000a  Yeah I agree. I think that they weren't really prepared. They were too wrapped up in what was going on to think  about the downfall and what was happening. They're tired and probably weak, they didn't have safe... they weren't really all there to think  about what are the consequences of this and what would happen. Like the guide, if it were me,   I would have made sure they had this... that you're  gonna help me out more than not really being able to.\u000a  Anything you wanna say, Krystin?\u000a  Well, I said that this quote at the top it says that, "Ambition has a steep price." And I think part of like how you guys were talking about how like the guides weren't too prepared and weren't qualified but, I think that, well and the author mentions this too, that climbing this mountian is... it's taking a risk and your ambition for going up this mountain already when  you're putting your life on the line, there's nothing really anybody can do to tell you the qualifications that you have to have to survive, it's just basically putting your life to chance, and so... that's what I really got  out of it... what do you think?\u000a  I agree, I think that , then  not as many people would've died. They should just listen  to what they're told and and not risk their lives  to do something that .\u000a  I agree with that No, but I think that what Krystin said makes a lot of sense that people were just too tired and \u000a  I agree but I think it's understandable because just the thought of climbing the biggest mountain in the world is extremely... cool. and I would definitely want to go up there soon as possible, and not worry about the weather, like go all in or don't go at all\u000a  I agree with   lost or injured I mean but I'm like half way there  go ahead and accomplish what I set out to do and I think that  would've caused anybody to not really notice the weather and the risks involved in what we're doing. \u000a  I agree with what Ellie said a little while ago heard they should have turned around, but they probably thought that this was going to be probably what could have been a once in a lifetime chance to be at Mount Everest I mean it says that they caught about  safely but they should have have taken it more serious and not kept going risking their life... \u000a  One thing I noticed is that they relied a lot on each other but they didn't go back and check themselves and I didn't understand why they didn't go back and and like, when the one guy says, "there's no oxygen here, there's no full tanks." Why didn't they go back and check that themselves? I mean I would trust that person but yet again, if my life on the line. I would be checking it. Does anyone else think the same way? \u000a  If my life were at risk, I wouldn't be relying too much on other\u000a  If my life were at risk, I wouldn't be relying too much on other people. I'd be a little weary about something like that.\u000a  I don't so much disagree but I came up with something a little bit different. I didn't really think that people relied on each other that much at all. Who knows if all the deaths that happened could have been prevented but people were too tired or too injured or, there was always something and everybody was more concerned about getting themselves down the mountain. In a way I would say that it was selfish mission but in another way... I mean if it was my own life, I would be out for myself rather than trying to help somebody else and I think we saw that, at least I saw that a lot happen throughout the story. It's a choice between am I going to help that person and risk my life and they might not really pull through this, does it matter? Or am I going to get down this mountain and survive?\u000a  Some people were relying on others, like at the end, someone was trying to help  was trying to help , he tried to help her down,  she grabbed his arm, and he tried to pull her down. But she just let go and died. \u000a  I agree with Erin too. I mean I think that right now wouldn't be able to. You would think about yourself more. Whenever you're out there and and you're with the same people for that long of a time, and you're doing the same thing, that you become  sort of closer... They would mean more to you then than they do right now. You'd be more willing to sacrifice something, to survive, to help them give them another chance to get out alive too. \u000a That's definitely shown at the end of the article when he's  talking about how he can't live a day without thinking about the lives of those people that he was so close to that were lost  and how he couldn't even come to grips with their deaths for a very long time.\u000a  I agree with Erin, I think there was a lot of, at the end, I think he was talking about the  there  was a lot of blame involved and why couldn't we prevent this, and it brings me back to what you guys said, I think they really wanted to help each other and I think that they wanted to do something but there was nothing that could be done in some cases. I thought it was kind of sad actually dealing with that kind of grief where you couldn't prevent someone's terrible death. \u000a  Tyler, what do you think about this? Like did he grieve, or even just the fact that... who they were  relying on.\u000a  Well, what strikes me   \u000a  All right, outer circle, what'd you notice? What'd you notice?\u000a  I noticed that people were   and books and just kind of in inner circle and I felt  that that really helped them to get the instructions.\u000a  Okay. Blake, what did you notice?\u000a I just thought that it was more and more, like Erin really led the conversation and Krystin really led the conversation and I think that those were like the two main ones, but like Levi and  Elliot and Alex, they all also communicated a lot but there wasn't just one person who was talking. \u000a  Okay, so there were definitely two leaders, but there were other people that were contributing as they went along. Okay, good. Anthony.\u000a  There were some well-developed conversations.\u000a  Well-developed conversations, what do you mean by that?\u000a Like Erin would say something and someone would build on it, then someone else would and then another topic and new questions and another topic. \u000a  Yeah, did you notice- what was the question  they started with?\u000a  Yeah, we got a little off-topic.\u000a  No you didn't. What, what was the question  you started with? What caused the disaster? And then you went into something totally different but, did you have good conversation about that? Absolutely! You guys really started focusing in on that life and death and relying on somebody else for your own life. Okay, I really like how-- I mean it wasn't like you were talking about cookies and then all of a sudden you were talking about climbing Mount Everest. It was definitely very connected to what you were saying. Dorothy, what'd you notice?\u000a I noticed the conversation just kept going and it didn't stop or anything it just kept going from one thing to another.\u000a  Right it kept bouncing from one thing to another. You could see, like steam coming out of your ears, they were all impulsive. Blake?\u000a I thought that also, remember Erin said, "you're relying on someone," and Krystin's like, "well I don't agree." backed up Erin and other people backed up Krystin and there was people who didn't \u000a  Yeah. Is it okay to disagree with the people that are sitting around you? Absolutely! But you need to do it respectfully. Like Krystin did. Krystin said, "I don't exactly agree with you Erin."" then she proceeded to say, 'Why?'  And Levi was over here, he was nodding his head and shaking, 'yeah.' All right, great.\u000a  I thought they did a good job of not having any dramatic pauses, they always had something, someone would pass on to someone else \u000a  They paused occasionally but it was not pregnated pauses. You guys ever heard that before? It wasn't a pregnant pause, it wasn't a big spacey gap, okay, Anthony?\u000a  Pretty much everyone talked\u000a  Pretty much everyone talked. Yeah, pretty much.\u000a \u000a  Yeah, did you notice that? They built on to what other people were saying, okay? They agreed, I still heard I agree a lot; but then they told us why they agree with what they said. All right? Anything else you guys noticed? Yes?\u000a I think that we looked at our  more, because they  had wider subject that they talked about. Eventually it became narrowed down that is was kind of like you have to look for specific details. It wasn't the whole story, it was more like a paragraph or two and so you need specifics to deal with that.\u000a  All right. Anything else?\u000a

V  At the end of class, I want you to be able to explain how to swing the bat faster so the ball will travel further. Because the faster the bat goes, the further the ball's gonna go. And there's three things that we're going to do to make the bat swing faster. Okay, we're going to hold the bat at the end to make it longer. We're gonna hold the end to make it longer. A longer bat means a faster bat. We're gonna use more body parts or muscle when we swing and we're gonna apply more time to our swing by stepping into the swing. And we're learning to bat so that we can play more and more fun games in order to stay healthy. Because there's lots of fun batting games you can play with your friends here at school and outside of school that will help you have a healthy heart and muscles. And we're gonna do four different things today. I'm gonna ask you to talk to a partner, I'm gonna do a little experiment, we're gonna play spotlight tag, and then we're gonna have some personal practice. And I've created a little healthy a little helping worksheet for you that shows you what it looks like. Now all these things will help you know and help you be able to explain how to swing the bat faster. I want you to turn to a partner and tell them as many things, of as many games that you can that use swinging a bat or an impement. Go ahead. \u000a  Hey everybody, let me  get your attention. If I pull your stick, I want you to tell us a game or an activity that you can do that requires using a bat or an implement to hit a ball or something. We're green? No, we're red. Jeremiah, where's Jeremiah? Yes?\u000a  Softball.\u000a  Softball, very good. Raquel, where's Raquel? What, Raquel? Game or something you can play.\u000a  \u000a  Do we use a bat to play soccer?\u000a  No.\u000a  No. How about...Stephanie? Baseball? Who said golf, what about golf? What about ping pong? Do you know what ping pong is?  Yeah! So all of these activities are things that we can play once we learn how to swing a bat. Now, we're gonna go around the blue house, and you're gonna sit on the red dot until I say go, and I'm gonna do a little experiment to show you how these things can make the ball go further. I would like you to walk, please be careful. Go. \u000a  Okay, thank you for sitting. Now over there I said the longer the bat, the faster it goes. The faster the bat, the further the ball goes. So I'm gonna show you what I mean. Is this a very long bat?\u000a  No.\u000a  No, so I'm gonna swing and see how far it goes. \u000a  Did it go very far?\u000a  No.\u000a  Now I'm gonna make that longer. Who thinks it's gonna go further? Let's see if it goes further.  \u000a  It went a little bit further, huh?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Now, by holding the bat at the end it'll make it longer and it'll go further. Now another way we make the bat go faster is by using more body parts and muscles. So I'm only gonna use a couple muscles here to swing the bat. You think this will this go very far?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Yeah? Okay, let's see.\u000a  No.\u000a  I didn't use a lot of muscle. Now I'm gonna use lots of muscles on this step, and I'm gonna twist,  see how far it goes. \u000a  Do it again, do a lot of muscle.\u000a  Anyone know of any other way we can make the bat go faster? Hit from the bottom?  I had it written over there. Does anyone else remember? I want to make my bat longer, I want to use lots of muscles, and.... Alex?\u000a  .\u000a  That's how we use lots of muscles. I want to swing the bat for as long as I can in order to generate speed. Now, if I start my bat right here and I swing it, do I have lots of time to hit the ball?\u000a  No.\u000a  Do you think it'll go far? Let's see what happens. \u000a  Now, if I start way back  here, do you think I'll have more time?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  You think it'll go further?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  All right, let's see. \u000a  So, raise your hand if  you want to hit the ball far? Hitting the ball far will help you be successful, and if you're successful, you're going to have a good time. But today we're going to learn different  ways to hit the ball further by making our bat go fast.\u000a  Don't swing; please tell me.\u000a  \u000a  It makes the bat go faster. Why does the bat go faster?\u000a  .\u000a  The bat goes faster, the ball goes faster. But what makes the bat go faster, because it's short or long?\u000a  \u000a  Long. Longer bat means faster. Okay, rotate! Rotate! \u000a Dominant hand on top. Step, twist. We're practicing what grip is the best. \u000a  How'd that one go?  Fernanda, what grip are you using?\u000a  Mr. Holden, can I go to the bathroom?\u000a  Hurry. \u000a  Excellent twisting, Derek, excellent twisting! \u000a  What number are you going to read it? \u000a  Try this one: hold  your bat with your hands apart. Put your left hand on top. I mean your right hand on the top. Left hand at the bottom. Spread your hands apart like this. Now try it again. How did that go? Is that one good? You think so? Now hold it at the end, see what happens. It's right here. \u000a  Now hold your hands, put your right hand on the top. Right hand on the top, your right hand on top.  All right, Fernanda. Big step, let's see it. Big step, twist your whole body. Get your bat back, there you go. Try it again. Did the ball go further that time?  \u000a Okay, sit behind your  little cone and answer  the question on your card. Alright, now read it out loud for me.   Which grip do you think makes the bat swing fastest? Holding it at the end? Remember when we talked about how long the bat is? A longer bat can travel faster or slower?\u000a  \u000a  Faster, so when you hold it  at the end it makes it longer, and then you can swing it faster, and then the ball goes further. Is that what happened?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  All right, rotate. \u000a  Alright, are you going to twist or not twist? \u000a  Back foot, step. Put your weight on your front foot. \u000a  Alright, so pretend your feet  are stuck in mud, so you can't move them.\u000a  So we've been learning all the different ways we can make the bat go faster so that we can hit the ball far, because when we hit the ball far, our game and when we're batting is more enjoyable. We've practiced, we've talked about, and we've discussed three different ways to make the bat go faster so that the ball will travel further. When we're batting, okay? I have a sentence frame for you, it says: "I can blank to make the bat go faster "so the ball will go further." Okay, you're in your batting team groups right now. When I say go, I want you to use this sentence frame and discuss the three different ways you can make the bat go faster so the ball will travel further. And then I'm gonna pull our sticks, and you'll get to share with the entire class how you think you can make the bat go faster. So now is your time to use all of the intelligence and brains of your group to figure out your three answers. Are there any questions?\u000a  No.\u000a  Okay, I'm gonna give you about two minutes. Use the sentence frame, discuss with your group. Go ahead.  Alright, how is your group doing? Jesse, you getting to share? I might pick your stick. Talk with Alex. What are we coming up with Jeremiah? How are we gonna make the bat go faster? Do you remember?\u000a Okay, how about Alex. Why do we twist, Alex? Alex, why do we twist? Alex, sit up, please. When we twist, we use more what?\u000a  Muscles!\u000a  What color were we? Black or green?\u000a  Red!\u000a  Oh, we were red? Okay second grade, eyes on me, please. Sit down on a number. You've had a nice opportunity to talk with your group to figure out the three ways we can make the bat go faster. If I pick your name, please stand up, speak nice and loud and use the sentence frame, and tell us one way we can make the bat go faster. Let's see here... Jonathan. All right, Jonathan, stand up buddy. Jonathan, use the sentence frame, "I can."\u000a  \u000a  I can hold the bat at the end to make the bat go faster so the ball will go further. Good answer, give him a round of applause.  When we have a longer bat, it generates more speed, and more speed with the bat makes the ball go further. Now there are two other ways you can make the bat go faster.\u000a

V  Well, you know what, especially after Mrs. Bennett taught you the three things she wanted you to do in reading by having you look around the room, and skip around the room, and flip on the carpet, we thought, "Oh boy, that Nathan really "needs to do something hands-on." And I know from you being in Reading Recovery that when you heard a book twice you practically knew it. I mean, you knew the story. You could go somewhere and tell it, right?\u000a  Yep.\u000a  When you read the book is it easy for you to retell it? What is it like to retell a story that you just read?\u000a  Not so easy for me,  'cause I had to pick up a book, look at it for a minute and then I pop it and then I know it.\u000a  Okay, if I read a  story to you would you be able to go tell it to someone else?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  But right next to me.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  All right, well these  are the things we're gonna practice. And because we don't want to leave out the visual style of learning because it's also an important way to get information, we're gonna focus on the auditory and the kinestetic, the hearing and the hands-on type learning, and we're also gonna include some visual so that it will strengthen that part for you. But we wanna make sure we're getting you where your strength is. Because you are fantastic at listening and doing hands-on activities. Oh, you have a plan in your mind about what kind of castle you're gonna build?\u000a  It's not a castle. It's gonna be like when I see that in movies. Like a tower like where the Egypt, Egyptites.\u000a  The Egyptians?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Like a pyramid?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay, cool. All right. Would you like some extra things, like maybe some games or some extra things you can do to help you remember in class?\u000a  Yeah because my teacher she gives us free games, like learning games, in our math book. There's math games and you have to put your thing on it and you have to guess who much it is. And if you get it right you stay on there.\u000a  Okay, cool. Well I want to add some games like that that you're gonna-- And we're gonna add some things that you can do to help you remember directions in class and remember what Miss Smithson has asked you to do. 'Cause one of the things that I've noticed is that when Miss Smithson gives you two or three directions, you'll start one and then you forget what the other ones are. And you're like, "Ugh, what do I do now?"\u000a  Yeah because my  brain it has so much stuff and because if I get more it kind of breaks the other stuff.\u000a  And you know, I wasn't gonna talk about this yet but by you saying that, your brain has so much stuff, I wanted to remind you about, do you know what good listening looks like?\u000a  Uh, huh.\u000a  What do good listeners look like?\u000a  Their hands are crisscrossed with their hands in their lap and wherever the teacher goes they keep their eyes on 'em.\u000a  Okay, and then if you have a comment, if I say, "Would anyone like to ask a question "or make a comment about what we're learning?" Let's say I just taught you about Clemson Football.\u000a  Or I like hockey. That's my favorite.\u000a  Okay, let's say we were learning about hockey. The equipment used in hockey, okay? So if I asked you to either ask me a question or make a comment about what we're learning, would you tell me the names of some of the hockey equipment that you know of? Or would you ask me a question about a piece of hockey equipment that you've seen but you don't know what it's called? Or would you tell me a story about how you really like hockey?\u000a  Hmmm, how I really like hockey.\u000a  I knew you'd say that! You always do that! You remember one of things that Miss McGinnis taught you in Reading Recovery? And one of the strengths, this is what I love about you, one of the things that a lot of people have trouble with when they're reading is that they can't relate what they're reading to themselves or to their lives. You are absolutely fantastic with that. Fantastic.\u000a  If there's a story of a dog and I have a dog and my dog did the same thing.\u000a  Right. So since you're so good at that, though, sometimes I think that that is one of the things that gets your mind off on... on... "Hey my dog did that." Instead of on exactly what your teacher's wanting you to do. So one of the things about being a really good listener is to remember what comments, and what statements and what questions are necessary for what you're learning. And which comments and questions should wait for later, even though they're zinging around in your head, okay? So if I'm doing a whole class lesson about different colored fur on dogs and I say, "Can anyone think of a color "that a dog's fur might be?" What would be a comment you could make?\u000a  Black and brown 'cause that's what my dog is made out of.\u000a  Okay, black and brown. All right, let's say somebody says blonde, somebody else says white and then somebody raises their hand and they say, "Well, I don't know what all colors dogs can be "but my dog Sandy is really pretty." Is that a comment that is necessary for what we're talking about?\u000a  No.\u000a  Okay, so that's one of the things that you can practice. And I love your stories and I know Miss Smithson does, too. And you have a lot of kids and grownups in this school that feel really close to you and we feel like we have a good relationship with you because you do share things about yourself.\u000a  Yeah, but I only do that at the beginning of the day, the end of the day and at writing. 'Cause I write down the things in writing.\u000a  Good, well then I'm glad Miss Smithson is also working on this with you because as much as I want to know about you I don't want it to distract you from what it is you're supposed to be thinking about. Okay?\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Three more blocks. Okay, let's talk about some of the things that we're gonna put in place for you, okay? A couple of 'em I'm pretty excited about, okay? We're gonna work on your memory with reading and in general with classwork so that when someone tells Nathan what to do, Nathan's gonna be able to remember it. Instead of getting distracted and thinking, "Huh. "I have no idea what I'm supposed to do next."\u000a  Yeah because in my class there's some kids, Zachary and Brody and the two new kids, they're talking in the back.\u000a  And that's can be very distracting, can't it? Okay, do you know how to focus? Do you know how to tune people out? What do you do when you're distracted in the classroom?\u000a  I just turn around and go like this.\u000a  Okay, do you think you know how to tune people out without having to tell them to stop? What if you knew they were gonna talk no matter what but you still needed to listen? Could you?\u000a  I could do this to block their sound.\u000a  Okay, you could. That kinda reminds me of the bat we were talking about for some reason. It's kinda like you're directing your hearing at one place.\u000a  And sometimes I push it to what I'm hearing at. So then when I do that in my mouth I can hear it more good without noises from the construction site that's near our house. I can focus on it.\u000a  Okay, I think that's fantastic what you've just said. You make a conscious effort to focus on what you're trying to hear. That what I want you to do when you notice that other people are talking behind you. Instead of worrying about what they're doing, I want you to focus on what you need to be hearing. I want you to stop and think, "I'm not gonna listen to them, "I'm gonna listen to Miss Smithson." Okay? And see if that helps. Just like you strain to hear the construction noises, okay? All right, we're gonna do some fun things with you that I think you're gonna like. First of all, I know you love video games. So one of the things that we've tried before that doesn't seem to be working very well is Odyssey. And I know that when you get on Odyssey you like to choose the math games over the reading games. Probably just--Why do you choose math over reading?\u000a  'Cause I wanna get  more math so then I can just focus on reading 'cause if I'm really smart at math I can just drop it so I know everything.\u000a  I know sweetheart. It's a lot more fun to do something that you're really good at. So we're gonna change up your computer program. Instead of having you work on Odyssey during the day, instead of Odyssey you're gonna work on a new program called Earobics. And it's supposed to be super helpful with your reading skills. And Mrs. Price, the speech teacher whose office is across the hall, she said it is really fun and that she knew kids at Griggs Road that did it and they loved it, okay? So we're gonna try Earobics. So we're gonna keep a computer game for you but we're gonna try one that hopefully is gonna work better to help your reading skills come up instead of Odyssey. Okay? All right. The next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna give you a little tape recorder. Have you ever had a tape recorder?\u000a  No and I haven't even seen one.\u000a  I know, a lot of people don't use tape recorders anymore. Most people can record things on their phone and all kinds of gadgets.\u000a  Well I had when I  was little I had this little thing and it had a recorder. When I would sing a song into the microphone I could record it and then play it to my friends.\u000a  Okay, well we're gonna do something like that. We're gonna have you, if Mrs. Smithson is giving directions and then you guys are getting ready to do an assignment or group work or whatever it is she wants you to do, she's gonna come over and she's gonna give the directions to you. You get to press record on your tape recorder and say the directions yourself into the tape recorder. Then you get to stop it and play it back and hear yourself saying the directions. Okay? Unless you need them, we're gonna have you put the little tape recorder away so that it doesn't bother you. Like maybe in a pocket behind your seat or something. And then only if you get stuck and you think, "Hmm, what did Miss Smithson want me to do?" can you get out that recorder and listen.\u000a  Yeah or I can have it recording beside me so I could record everything and if I still remember it, like it's so easy I can remember it, I can just erase it.\u000a  Okay. But I think the actual act of hearing it whole group with the rest of the kids in your room, hearing it with just Miss Smithson telling it you, saying it again yourself and then hearing what you said, that may be all you need. You may not have to listen to it again. I think just making sure you're really concentrating on what the directions are is gonna be a really good thing for ya. Okay, also, oop. I gotta get something from over here. Okay. One of the other things we might do is maybe Miss Smithson might tell you something, like give you a direction, and she's gonna whisper it in your ear and then you have to whisper it to the person beside you. And they're gonna whisper it to the person beside them and it's gonna go around the table until it gets back to you. How many of you all sit at one group?\u000a  Five or six. I think it's gonna be five 'cause we got two more kids.\u000a  Okay, so sometimes Miss Smithson might say, "Get out your pencil, get out your math book "and turn to page 50." Okay? So then you have to whisper that into the ear of the person beside you. What would you say?\u000a  "Get out your pencil and get out your math book "and turn to page 50."\u000a Okay and then that person would have to whisper it to them. Then it's gonna come all the way around and then the last person's gonna say, "Get out your pencil, get out your math book "and turn to page 60." Is that right?\u000a  I'll just turn back to 'em and say, "It's 50."\u000a  It's 50. Okay, okay. That's another way we might make sure that we understand the directions before we get started.\u000a  Sometimes my teacher she just writes it on--\u000a

V  Are you gonna have any angles in there that add to 90? No, so you won't have any complementary to worry about.\u000a  Is that supplementary, though?\u000a  You will have supplementary. Right. You're not gonna have to worry about the outside. You're just gonna look at your inside. When you measure your angles you'll be able to see supplementary.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Then kinda go back to those parallel lines cut by a transversal rules to explain why. \u000a  We're supposed to draw a line?\u000a  Well I want you to see what's congruent sides. Now, you dont have to measure all your sides because have these, so you've got the same colors, so they're all the same. You're don't have to do angles. Kinda figure out, OK... So they're all 90 degrees. One of yours looks 90. So you know they're 90s. So you got, for the outside of your figure, you got some a little bit easier work.\u000a  Yeah\u000a  OK, so you need to explain why things are 90, and what are congruent. And then, you're gonna get a lot more new stuff when you redraw and draw your diagonals in there. Then you'll actually have to measure your diagonals and your angles. So you know a lot about a square to start with.\u000a  Yeah the equal sides have to be congruent, and certain sides, so write that?\u000a  Then measure those  angles and segments and see if you can't find some more rules that go with a square.\u000a  Oh, OK.\u000a  So yes, your first set of rules for the first page, from here, you know a lot. You know that any point and what they are. You know you have equal sides. Then you don't have to measure these sides because you used the same color. So you can explain it using the colors. So you got a lot you know from the first part. But then when you draw your diagonals here, you're gonna have to measure your pieces. See what happens to these angles. See what happens to these diagonals. And then see if you can't come up with some rules. You're main part here, you know a lot. But now when we do this, this will some of the new.\u000a  OK.\u000a  Square is the last  one that we teach. So you will be the last group up there, today. Right, we're trying to get these rules today. You can kinda build upon them so when you hear what these other groups are doing when you get up there.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  There's just three of you.  \u000a  OK.\u000a  How you doing?\u000a  Good.\u000a  What do you notice  about some of these? Corresponding is what I got here, down here. These are supplementary. Supplementary because they're what type of angles? Help him respond. Well there are options, focus on one. If we were to look at... If I was continuing these lines here they're gonna be same side interior. Obviously yes, so they're not quite supplementary. So you might need to go back and do it again. Sammy knows they need to be supplementary. Same side interior. Somehow your measurements didn't get there. So go back and try to remeasure. You realize you wrote the error. That's good, so you're using some of that previous knowledge and realizing your error. Yeah, so you need what we did on that worksheet the other day. When you measured between 110 and 120 you read the wrong way. You read 122 when it's going this way it's 118. So what you did is you read this way, when you're going this way. You said 122, when it's between 120 and 110. At least your teammates knew that we needed supplementary and worked it.\u000a  You said it was only off by one degree.\u000a  Any amount... Then again, to then explain your rules now, what's congruent, what's supplementary, and then explain why, like you were saying same side interior, that's what you'll have. \u000a  Yes?\u000a  Do you have Chester Marlin?\u000a  Yes I do.\u000a  Please send  him to the office.\u000a  OK. \u000a  What you did was perfect.\u000a  Because they're same side interior.\u000a  So you would say this...\u000a  Would you say equal angle one and angle four?\u000a  That'd be fine,  because you can go ahead and when you're teaching it you can label those angles, and that would be a really good way to do it.\u000a  So it's like, angle one and angle four are same side interior?\u000a  Same side interior, so that has to equal 180. OK, bisectors are gonna come when you cut diagonals in there. Your second page, when you redraw the figure. You're gonna draw the diagonals, you're gonna see your diagonals cut each other, you're gonna see if your diagonals cut your angles in half. I'll be to Ashley then at Brandon's group in just a minute. So make sure your congruent sides. You don't have to measure your sides if you use your colors, you can use colors to explain it. So yeah, you're exactly on the right track. Here we're just gonna draw the same figure, draw those diagonals in there, and then we got a little bit-- some more things. You might see bisectors, you might not. Some figures you do and some you don't. All right. OK, it's up to you. I love the way you put your letters there. So you're getting really good with your letters. You can say... Since you only have one angle at each letter, you can say angle J or angle H, however you want to do that.\u000a  Could we just put supplementary, and draw a little diagonal like that?\u000a  That'd be fine. Actually, do all these, and you've got your congruent and your angles, then you're gonna redraw the same thing over here, put your diagonals in and measure again. When you put diagonals in, you might see some that bisect the angles, or bisect segments. You might not, but that's what you're looking for.\u000a  So this is gonna be... \u000a  Well, the diagonals... We're not gonna draw one of them.\u000a  Oh, we're not?\u000a  No, we're just gonna look at our diagonals. Otherwise you're breaking it into two other figures. And that's a possibility, but you don't have to. I love the way that you've lettered it, here. You're using those correct terms, that'll be really good as you go up there. All right, Brandon.\u000a  What all did we mess up so far?\u000a  Let's see. Well it's a four sided figure. What should a four sided figure add up to?\u000a  360.\u000a  360. Does it?\u000a  No, it's a little more than 360.\u000a  So you might need to change things a little bit, to remeasure it, and one of your rules could be you know that they have to add to 360. There's some that I see really right away that's good.\u000a  It's like 370.\u000a  OK, so you're gonna try to make it work. You know you need to make it work. You know it's gotta be 360 so measure it a little bit better.\u000a  Can we just add one here and add two there?\u000a  Well go ahead and look to see what your actual angles are. But one good thing you see, you see that these angles are the same, which is something you're supposed to come up with, which is good. Now if I was giving this, when you're up there explaining it, you need a way to explain, and I know you said that the two obtuse angles are congruent, and in your picture that's good. But sometimes, let's think for a minute, If I gave you... Write them out. Yeah it may always be the obtuse angle. So here, yeah, that's what I was thinking. If you were to do it this way, the angles that are congruent aren't necessarily the obtuse ones. So what you've found is good, but in your picture it is the obtuse ones, but if you can see as you move that, it doesn't have to be the obtuse ones. Let's look at a way we can describe. You're saying that these two angles are congruent, which is correct, so instead of saying obtuse, how can I explain that these two and not those two. What's the difference between these two angles and those two angles?\u000a  They're 45 degrees?\u000a  Well it didn't have to be. It could be 45, it looks 45, if I was to do this it's not.\u000a  It's the short side's angles.\u000a  It's where your short sides meet your long sides. So the angles with the non-congruent sides. Or the short sides meet the long angles, that would be perfect. That would be a little better to explain it. And even when you're up there explaining, a good thing to do would be to move your figure to show how it didn't have to be... And normally it's the bigger angles, but it doesn't have to be.\u000a  Draw diagonals?\u000a  That's right,  and you're gonna look for all the angles again. When you draw your diagonals, a lot of times you're gonna see bisectors, like segments might bisect each other, they might bisect angles, they might or they might not. So that's what you're looking for when you do that. And then you're gonna kind of come up to...\u000a  We just draw them like this?\u000a  Just like that, that's right. Then you'll measure all of those angles, and all of those segments. We won't be able to use the color to show congruent when we draw the diagonals on the inside, because you won't have a piece that matches correctly for your diagonals, so you'll actually have to measure that part with a ruler. But again, you're not as much concerned with the measurement as bisecting it or something else. So that's what you'll do. All right, I'll be right back. Yes?\u000a  So are we supposed to do this?\u000a  You don't need the angles that are out there. I mean, you could, but it's not necessary. What should, of course, our figure add up to?\u000a  The angles inside?\u000a  Uh huh.\u000a  360?\u000a  360. So make sure yours do.\u000a  What if they don't?\u000a  So I think, if I was to  look at your measurements, here...\u000a  I know what I did, I messed up, I wrote these...\u000a  Good, perfect, that's what I was gonna get to, you read the wrong one and didn't notice. All right, I'll be right back.  How are you doing? So you want to make some general rules.\u000a  So the top and the bottom sides have to be parallel.\u000a  I wouldn't really want  to use the words top and bottom, because what if you turn it this way?\u000a  Yeah, well, A and B sides.\u000a  Yeah, so you're gonna do that. So you've got your pieces. What do you notice about your angles? You've got the angles that are equal, but what if I was looking for supplementary? Do you have any supplementary angles?\u000a  A and D ?\u000a  A and D, so you say A and D are supplementary, what makes them supplementary? What rule do we already know that was why they're supplementary?\u000a  They add up to 180.\u000a  Right, they add up to 180, but...\u000a  Are they same side interior angles?\u000a  Same side interior angles. So you can say they're 180 because they're same side interior angles. Then what you're gonna do, you're gonna go to this page, you're gonna draw your figure again, but you've got to draw your diagonals, and measure the things. When you draw the diagonals, what you're really looking for is to see, is there anything that cuts in half? Do you bisect any angles or bisect any segments? Some figures do, some figures don't. But that's what you're looking for. So you're gonna redraw it, draw your diagonals, then measure, you'll have more angles to measure. You're actually gonna have to measure your segments because your little angle legs won't match your diagonals correctly. You're gonna have to actually do the measurements. and see. See if the segments are bisected, see if the angles are bisected. That's kind of what you're gonna come up with. It may be, it may not be. Some of the figures do and some don't. OK?\u000a  I think I understand that.\u000a  We draw from angles to angles?\u000a  Yeah, from vertex to vertex, that's right. So make an X in the middle. All right, you're good. Yes?\u000a  I think we have about everything, and then I think we have the other vertex... Angle bisectors, they bisect the angle number five. All the triangles are isosceles.\u000a  Wow, that's good, I didn't think you'd get that.  I'm impressed.\u000a  He did it.\u000a  Good job.\u000a  And then, diagonals make a perpendicular.\u000a  Perfect, what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna give you another sheet, make a bigger square...\u000a

V This is a classroom where I push in for language arts. This is a morning meeting area, and this is also the area where any whole group instruction would take place. Over here is the area that the assistant sits and works with children and does phonemic awareness activities. Here is a word wall, and where the students keep their folders with their reading books in it, their book boxes. Here is where the classroom teacher does word study. This is the independent work station. And here is where I sit, and I'm responsible for the reading instruction. This is where the guided reading groups meet. This is a little reading area over here. Where the students can do some independent reading.\u000a You know what Jane told me to do that I liked also? Looking at the word and chunking are good things to do. Jane said go back and reread and make sure it sounds right and makes sense. And that's something, Jesus, I want us to start practicing a little more. When we get to a word that tricks us, Put the book flat, Sarah, please We want to go back, and reread, and check and make sure it makes sense. Okay, here's something else I want us to do today with this book, Rascal. I want us to think about what happened in the story today. And we're going to do it this way. I want all eyes up here. We're gonna use this wipe board.\u000a It's a big wipe board.\u000a It is, and you have a little one. And you will probably get a chance to use it, too. But first, I'm gonna write on the big one. Okay. The first word up here, Jesus, I'm gonna ask you to help me read it. I'm gonna chunk it because you know the first part of this word\u000a [Child} Some. Okay, Jesus is gonna help us. Okay, Jesus, go ahead and help me read this word.\u000a  Some.\u000a Can you try...\u000a  body\u000a Somebody, good job. You see how he broke that into chunks? Do you see that, Jane? Somebody. Let's think about the story. Hands down. I want you to think about the question before you put your hand up. Somebody. Somebody's in the story. Who is the somebody? Who is this story mostly about? Kelly's gonna help us. Kelly, who's this story mostly about? Put your hand down, Sarah.\u000a  I think is  Josie's taking Rascal to the vet.\u000a You're right. Josie's taking Rascal to the vet. So who are we talking about in the story? Are we talking mostly about Rascal, or are we talking mostly about the vet? Hands down, let her think. She'll ask for help if she needs it. Who do you think the story's mostly about?\u000a  Um, Rascal.\u000a Rascal, I agree. Thumbs up if you agree. Thumbs up if you agree. Sarah, do you agree? I agree, do you agree? You do, I see a thumbs up. Okay? So what did you want to say about the title of the story?\u000a  Maybe the story was mostly about Rascal because the title.\u000a Jackie, did you hear what Sarah said? She said, that's some good thinking, Sarah. She said she also knew it was mostly about Rascal because the title was in it. I knew it was mostly about Rascal because I read the story and they talked about Rascal a lot in the story. Rascal. Rascal Okay. Rascal's in the story. Alright. Rascal, now, there's a problem. At the very beginning of the story, and I'm gonna go back in the book and look and see what it is. Sarah, what's a problem in the very beginning of the story?\u000a  I read the words and it said he didn't want to go in the door to see the vet.\u000a He didn't want to go to the vet. Why do you think he didn't want to go to the vet, Jackie? How come? Why do you think Rascal didn't want to go to the doctor? Let's listen to what Jackie says.\u000a  'Cause he's scared.\u000a He's scared. How did you know that he's scared, Jackie? I agree. How did you know that? \u000a Because the picture shows he's looking like he's upset or sad. And I like how Sarah said she read in the story, Eddie, she read that he didn't want to go to the vet. Turn the page. I see other things happening. I'm gonna ask you about that in a minute. Okay, so somebody is Rascal. And Rascal, the problem is, he didn't want to go, Rascal didn't want you know what, Kelly, come up here and help me write. 'Cause you can write the rest of what I'm gonna write. Come up here. Didn't, Oh, I'm gonna do the want part. Didn't want. Rereading helps me think about what I want to write. Rascal didn't want what? To go. Can you write to go? Don't forget to space. Rascal didn't want to go to, let's have a bigger space. Rascal didn't want to go to the I like how you're all looking to see. You're good, that's fine. Just keep going. Good, thank you. Rascal didn't want to go to the Who wants to try vet? Sarah you want to try? That's a word we haven't written before. But I know that she can think about the sounds in it, and I bet you she can do it. Good job. Thank you, Sarah. Okay. Rascal didn't want to go to the vet. But, but what? Eddie, but what? He didn't want to go?\u000a  But He went and he was scaring the animals. Oh my goodness. Rascal didn't want to go to the vet, but he went anyway and scared the animals. Hold on a minute, Jane, 'cause I know you're gonna help me. But he went anyway. Hold on one second, then you can tell me. and scared, should we say, I'm thinking about how this should sound, I'm thinking about what happened in the story. but he went anyway and scared the other animals, or other animals, or the animals? He did scare cats, who else did he scare?\u000a  the mouse.\u000a Can I have a quiet hand for someone else? He scared the cat, the mouse. Jackie, who else did he We can always, let Jackie help. Let Jackie help, let's look. Jackie, let's go back and look. And you're looking at the pictures. Jackie's gonna help us. Jackie, I see the cat that Jane said. What other animal do you see in the picture that he scared?\u000a the parrot and the rabbit. Oh, okay, the parrot and the rabbit. Okay, he went anyway and scared a rabbit, I'm gonna put this mark here 'cause I have a couple things I'm saying. a cat and I don't have room here, so I need to erase this word, so I have room to keep writing. He went anyway and scared a rabbit, a cat, and what's the last thing I need to say, Kelly? And, a what?\u000a  Parrot.\u000a Parrot.\u000a  And I wanted to say\u000a Okay, what did you want to say?\u000a  I want to say that I really know about these, I know their names, they call commas.\u000a You're right., thank you. Kelly helped me because I didn't say what these were called. She reminded us that those are called commas. Thank you, Kelly. Okay, one moment, Jane. I want us to think about the story, and I want us to think about what's happening. Rascal didn't want to go to the vet, but he went anyway and scared a rabbit, a cat, and a parrot. So we have a big problem.\u000a  we need to find a solution.\u000a We need to find a solution. What is our solution to the problem? Sarah? Can you sit on your bottom so you don't fall and hurt yourself?\u000a  my solution is that at the end of the story, right here, he goes in to the vet, so he doesn't scare the other animals.\u000a  Okay, I like how all of you went back to check the solution, and you went back in the story to help you understand what happened. Jane, I like what Sarah said, and I'm thinking about how I can write that. Sarah was looking at this page, and she saw how he went into the vet, and now he won't scare the other animals. Okay.\u000a  Can I read this page? Yes, and in fact, Jane wants to read it, and she's gonna, I want all of us to read it with our eyes, because I want us to listen to how that sounds with those dark parts the author said. Go ahead, Jane, are you ready?  I love how that sounded, and I saw you were practicing that, too, Kelly. Let's all practice that to ourselves. The big dog growled, grrrrr. Rascal ran. Jesus, how did she know, How did Jane know to say Rascal ran? How did she know to read it like that?\u000a  The author wrote it in dark and big.\u000a He wrote it in dark and big, he sure did. And he said something else, Eddie, that I want you to look at. He wrote it dark and big, and what else did he put there at the end? Remember what that mark's called? It's a big, fancy long word. That's okay, Sarah's gonna help us. This mark, right here, Eddie, is what we're talking about.\u000a  Comma?\u000a Nope, but it looks\u000a  Somebody that's talking.\u000a Yes, and when they're loud, go ahead, Sarah.\u000a An exclamation mark.\u000a Yeah. That word is a very long word and it's new to us Eddie, so we're learning it. Do you wanna try and say it after me? Exclamation mark, yeah. That shows they're excited\u000a You mean this?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Oh, I though you were this.\u000a Oh, well, no wonder, I was tricking you by accident, I'm so sorry, Eddie. Yes, I was talking about the exclamation mark. Okay, Rascal didn't want to go to the vet, but he went anyway and scared a rabbit, a cat, and a parrot. And so the end of the story should say, that, it's a solution, Sarah was\u000a He ran into the vet.\u000a What made him? Why did he run?\u000a Because he was scared.\u000a Of what?\u000a the dog.\u000a Jesus, did you hear what Sarah said? So let's think about that. But, but he saw a what?\u000a  Big dog.\u000a Come over here and help me write. Me and Jesus are gonna write this together. Come on over here, Jesus. Lemme move this out of your way, I'm sorry. Okay, go over here. And turn around so everyone can read, come over by me. But he, you can write the word, he. Go ahead. Write it under here. Thank you. Now I'm gonna help you, give me the marker? Jackie, I need you to look over here, so you can help us if we need it. Go stand over here for a second. But he, oops, he saw, you go ahead a a what? He saw a what? Jackie, he saw a what?\u000a  A big dog.\u000a A big dog. And those are words you know, go ahead. Now come down here so we don't go too far up. Dog. Oops, something's tricking you. Go ahead and turn that around. Thank you, go ahead, give me the marker back. Thank you. Hold on. But he saw a big dog and, what happened? What happened, Sarah?\u000a  He\u000a  Yeah?\u000a  ran.\u000a  And he ran. Okay, come over and help me write that then, please. Come on over, over here. And he ran. Good. Go ahead and sit down. and he ran, where?\u000a  Into the vet. Okay, I'm gonna just finish this. And he ran in Into is easy because you know both of those parts. And he ran into the into the vet? Or into the vet's? What's that place? Let's put that, office or room. Let's put room. But both of those are good choices.\u000a

V That they need to make some sort of a change.\u000a  Like the turning point?\u000a Like there's a turning point. There's some kind of change that needs to occur. Do you guys think that most people take that opportunity and then change?\u000a  No.\u000a I think some no. In Fahrenheit 451, how some people were assuming that Mildred already knew, but she just didn't want to not like accept it  but not be part of it. She didn't want to be part of the change, she just wanted to be in tune with society.\u000a She never gave herself an opportunity to have any kind of turning point. \u000a Even when she had the opportunity, she didn't.\u000a Right.\u000a  I think emotion plays a big role in that, too, because Faber let fear get in the way of him doing something, so he basically created that little earpiece thing, so that somebody else could do it for him, and he could watch over somebody that's actually doing it.\u000a  Another person who's carrying the shoes to go through the turning point is Beatty, because although he had all of the knowledge, much more knowledge than Montag had about society and everything, he chose not to go against it because he believed that if he does it, then what's the point, if he's not going to gain anything out of it.\u000a  Do you think also because he has all that knowledge, he wants to use it to have power? Since he knows all that, he wants to manipulate, keep them in control, keep them in check and stuff.\u000a  No, I don't think it's that he wants power, I mean, it's that he's seen the bad side of things, and, like all humans, you don't like to go through something when it has lots of negativity in it. With education, he knows it's good because it helps you think outside of the box, and everything, but it's bad also because then you have two countering opinions on everything. Then you realize that there's genocides, there's slavery, there's wars, there's too much negativity.\u000a  The government also doesn't want that because it probably gives them ideas of where to go. The more information they know, the more possible ways they can use it against them.\u000a  I like what you said about the government doing that kind of stuff, because I guess they see it as a way of knowledge makes people--\u000a  Vulnerable.\u000a  Vulnerable. It's like if the people were the government's subordinates, so it's not the government's people who they're protecting, it's pretty much who they're in control of.\u000a  I kind of want to share my opinion on the turning point thing, like in Harrison, and bridge around again. You get to see the emotion, or what George has to go through, but yet he doesn't do anything about it; Harrison does. It says right here, "His thoughts fled and panicked like bandits from a burglar alarm." It's showing you what he has to go through for his thoughts to be taken out of his head, or whatever but Harrison is the one doing the actions. He's the one that wants to go against the government, and George isn't.\u000a  So, do you think their relationship and the correlation of George and Harrison is just like Montag and Faber's, where Faber doesn't want to do anything, because he didn't want to go to jail in the South? George doesn't want to go to jail because he doesn't want to lighten his own way because he would get, what was it, seven years?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a For each sled that he takes out. And Harrison is actually doing stuff. And Montag isn't doing stuff. So, do you think that you need that person, the one behind the scenes doing the stuff, and then a person that's actually doing it, or do you just mean people that actually already in action to a bill?\u000a I think that you need people who are  I think that you need people who are  but I think that it's easier to  so I think that way is better. So you don't get in trouble  \u000a  I think the people that have , the people in the front lines are always useful. They are easier to camoflauge  They are the ones with the real plans. These people in the front don't usually come up with them.\u000a Yeah, but you have the plans and then you don't do it. but what does it matter that you have the plan and you don't know how to use it?\u000a Well, not every body's that brave. \u000a That's why you need to...\u000a  I think people need the support system, like Faber was Montag's support system.\u000a He had a plan   \u000a  Don't let him tell you he sees, walk away, walk away. \u000a  I guess, here's my question. So, in looking at our essay question for our final exam tomorrow, I want you to think... our question is, to what extent should citizens comply with unfair laws, right, created by government? I know I'm asking you to respond with to what extent, should citizens comply with these unfair laws? But we're also talking about so who should act, right? So who should be the one to act out, to lead, to go against the government? Because we're looking at characters who possess the capacity to act out. We're looking at people who have knowledge, who have strength, who are talented. But they're not leaders. And we're also looking at people who may not have those qualities, they have the potential to have those qualities, but need a little bit of encouragement and a little bit of a push. So when we say to what extent should citizens comply, do you guys think that citizens applies to everybody? Or is it limited to a group of people who are willing to make those sacrifices? Do you even think that's fair that it's a small group of people who make the sacrifice for the whole? I want you to think about any types of current or historical events where we've seen a group of people, whether it is a whole group, or just a couple of people who take charge, who lead and impact change. Are there any examples that you can connect to that? Do you think that that's even fair for everyone to benefit from the sacrifice of a small group of people?\u000a  I see it as a way... every time there's a change, or a law, or something that affects a certain group of people, it's never really based on the whole group of people. Like all citizens. It's more of a target, and when a certain group is attacked or targeted, it makes others not really... I don't want to say care, but it doesn't really matter to them because they're not the ones that are experiencing the negativity of that. Or, yeah... it's just basically it's that group of people who have to, I guess, express their ideas and it may be scary for some people to go along with it and actually carry out what they think is right, but I think it's necessary for a unit. You probably need that one person who spreads the message, and then I think it is very important for other groups of people to go along with it because you never know when it's going to be your turn.\u000a  So, here's my question because on your AP exam, on your final exam, for your argumentative essays, you have to be able to generate your own examples. So, I know Omar you've got a very clear idea, but does any body have a historical reference or a current event that we can tie that idea to something specific, and that's what you can discuss. Let's see if we have any ideas here about historical or current events that we could really provide as really concrete examples that we could look at because you want to get specific. You want to say, "hey, let's look at this specific example, where this actually happened." Any thoughts on that?\u000a  Anything with slavery, with Frederick Douglass and the abolitionists in the north. They really felt the need that slavery was needing to be abolished and I guess that's where civil disobedience comes from, is the abolishment of slavery. Well, the need to abolish slavery. That it really wasn't really blacks or Africans, or whatever you called them back then. Wanting to be set free was people that weren't even affected by slavery that wanted them to be set free. And I think that's more important, and more appeals to your emotion because these people have no tie to slavery. They're not benefiting, they're not getting negative from it, so it's like you really think that it's wrong when someone else is not affected by the situation. It's saying that it's wrong.\u000a  I want to connect to what you just said about to the idea of the mental slavery that's going on right now because I guess maybe not a lot of you are aware, but there's... I don't know if you guys heard something about the green eye? That recently... that's in the past. And I think that's very important because that affects me in a way because many people wanna go to college but I guess the idea of going to college and getting your degree, but then not excelling in what you are supposed to be excelling in. That kind of stops them and discourages them from... to keep going. So I guess that idea is... I don't know, it's kind of opressive because they're trying to maintain you in that little... it's just marginalizing you and yeah, I think it needs more support.\u000a  So I want you to think about that example because there were a lot of protests, right? People were really protesting that, and there were a lot of these laws that people were standing against, right? And when we look at the questions, to what extent should we comply with unfair laws? If that is an unfair piece of legislation, to what extent do you then choose to protest? How far would you be willing to take it? Because we talked about this, this line between pushing your protest and your form of rebellion. Like look at Harrison, right? Dancing on stage as a ballerina. Doesn't really seem all that tough, right? But, for him, he was taking a big stance, right? Not about borderline violence, right? I want you to look at what Thoreau did. He didn't pay his taxes. He wanted to go to jail. He was happy there. He was like, "don't bail me out." Had nothing to do with violence, right? You hear a lot of people protesting, you know. Issues regarding the DREAM Act, but to what extent should they comply with the laws? Do you use violence? Do you even take it there? Do you use more creative forms of protesting? I want you to consider how far do you take it? How far do you show your protest? What is acceptable, and where do you draw the line?  Good reaction, lots of reaction. Let's hear from people we haven't heard from. I want you to go back and think about your goals that you set. I'm hoping those of you that are a little bit quieter in our discussions, chose goals that might push you to speak up. So let's hear from a few folks that we haven't heard from yet and share the air time. Any volunteer? Jesus, what do you think?\u000a  Like Omar said, like the DREAM Act, has an ill affect on a lot of people. It doesn't really affect me, but I know a lot of friends that it is affecting. It's not really fair that it really didn't pass, but when we want to try to push something, like Julian said for slavery, it didn't really take... it took such a long time for them to really get the rights. There was the abolishment, there was Frederick Douglass during that time. But as time went, then came Martin Luther King, who was the center person who started the really big move for African Americans to realize their own rights. He lead the protests, marches... if you gather groups of people over time... if you speak up with your voice people will hear. Even people like African Americans, they came and rallied to listen to the idea that everyone being equal. There should be rights and everyone... no matter what color you are. So for Latinos like us, for the , it's such a short time because we just started also trying to pass our rights, but the dream that was once dead, but even though it didn't pass, people should not be put down, like, "Aw, it didn't pass." So they'll just forget you got to stand back right up and get more people and to continue to pass on for your rights, cause if we stay together, anything can happen... If we stay together as one, something will happen.\u000a  I am hearing two things and we'll get back to Stephanie really quickly I think she's just itching to get in this conversation. I'm hearing two things. One, that it takes a collective group effort. It's not just one person, but it needs to be many people involved. As many people involved And I'm also hearing that it takes a lot of time. So those are a couple of factors that play in to going against unfair laws.\u000a  That's kind of like right now, that it's kind of more modern because .\u000a  You think so?\u000a  no, no, no.\u000a  I want you take this idea that Omar brought, this idea of mental slavery of oppression, of our intellect, our intelligence. Is that something that you think is just recent? Is that something that's been happening over time? I want you to think about that and see... we might isolate one part of the problem, but I want you to think on a broader scale. Is it really just one isolated event, or is this one in a stream of events? Stephanie, you had something that you were...\u000a  Yeah, all of them were in the governement, and I was thinking of the movie, "Milk". How they have to fight for the rights for equality for homosexuals and what he does is he runs for office in California, and to be heard, which is kind of like civil disobedience in a way. But he does it in a bigger way for them to be heard. One part in the movie that I'll always remember, is when a guy in a wheelchair calls him to tell him that he's gay and all of that. But he just hangs up, but yet he does it for him, most likely because he wants people like that to be heard. And that's kind of what my connection is.\u000a  I think another historical event besides the slavery and what  you just said is the nine eleven. I think it's the short-term one. It took actually really quick...  the terrorists going up there. It just took one simple idea to tell them, "Oh, let's just go..."\u000a

V  Clipart. Okay. You show me ... well, if we wanted to insert a Clipart picture, where do you think would be the best place to go? Click on insert. And then where is Clipart? Here you go. And I bet you we're going to find some really cool spider pictures. Click on spi-- type in spiders and see what you come up with. Hold on, I'll be right over. Yes. Wow, look at all those spiders. You have tons. Oh, your project's gonna be neat 'cause you have all kinds of neat pictures.\u000a Um... I think something in our computer is off.\u000a Okay. Let's turn this off. These computers sometimes get a little fussy and it's making bad choices.\u000a When I get 'em, I just keep pressing enter.\u000a Well, it's sort of like hitting an elevator button. But you can't really make it go any faster, but you feel a little better about click, click, click, click, click. So, go ahead and look over here. Hopefully that will come up a little faster. Sometimes it just is a little slow. Start with... there you go. You know what to do.\u000a Okay, there's a big picture.\u000a That's a huge picture. That's a neat spider. I think that'll be a neat one for your... for your project. Yeah.\u000a Okay. Um well, when we... when we clicked on the... uh... and it asked if we wanna include pictures from all the ones before...\u000a Yeah. We did want to do that.\u000a We did? And we clicked no.\u000a Okay. So that's probably why. Okay. So let's go onto Clipart office online and you're going to be able to find some really neat pictures here, too. This is the same thing. Type in squirrel. Let's see what we find. Make sure you spell it correctly.\u000a Q-U-I-R-R-E.\u000a It's a hard word.\u000a I-R-R-E.\u000a And then the color.\u000a Can I put S?\u000a Doesn't matter.\u000a Hit scroll or anything.\u000a Okay. And see what you can find. Look at all those squirrels.\u000a You should pick that one, a moving one?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. So, you copy it to your clipboard. Now here's the problem. You need to accept the service agreement and you'll have to do it again. Yes. Okay. Now, click on your scroll and add it to your clipboard.\u000a Three times.\u000a I... I know. Did you copy it to the clipboard? Did you click on it? Okay. Then go back to PowerPoint. Let's see if it works.\u000a Uh.\u000a You know how to copy and paste things, so go ahead and paste it in there.\u000a  Yay.\u000a He'll move, but not right now. When you go to... make him a little bigger, though, I would say.\u000a Make him fat.\u000a Now, you can check to see how he's doing. If you wanna go to your slideshow... and from the beginning and see if he'll move for you. There he goes.\u000a  Yay.\u000a See? Now you know he worked.\u000a Yay.\u000a Good job.\u000a, We are entertaining using second person stories. Last time we were together, we started a story here today called Aliens in the Library. You saw that I put my name up here on the line, and it says Aliens in the Library. The introduction page is the part where I underlined those 'you's. Did you notice how these 'you's are underlined over and over again? The reason is because we don't typically write like this. This is kind of unfamiliar for us. We had fun making the beginning of this story. We only wrote half of the story using this graphic organizer. Do we remember why we only wrote half of the story? Why did we only write this side of the story?\u000a Because that was, like the one story \u000a Right. There are two main things that you can choose from. If you look up here at the board, everybody should be looking up here, you can see that there are two choices for each one. You have your introduction and you have your two choices. We only did this half of the story, so right now we're going to hide the other half because we're not even thinking about it yet. So the story was that you're in the library, you hear a noise like, what did we say, rats in a blender? And so you go out to investigate what the story was. Now, that's the coolest part about this project guys. The reason we are making our own stories rather than me grabbing the book from a shelf and copying it on here is because we want to use information in our own way. What's that called when you take someone else's information and put it on a piece of paper? What's that called? Who can remember what that's called? What's that called?\u000a Copyright infringement.\u000a Copyright infringement, or there's another big 'p' word, too, that we talked about. That's a tough one, do you remember what that one is?\u000a Plagiarism.\u000a Plagiarism. And if you take a story of someone else's and stick it on there, it's a problem. And so, when you have a story in your mind you want to make sure that it is your story and your story alone. The best way for me to describe this is, right now for reading team we designed our own t-shirts for a t-shirt contest. Maybe your t-shirt isn't the winning entry, and the team doesn't make your shirt on their shirt. But you go to the competition, and another team from another school district has your shirt design on the front of it. How would you feel about that? How would you feel if someone took your idea and walked around with your shirt on? Your idea, that you came up with your in your own brain? How would that make you feel?\u000a Kind of angry.\u000a It would make me feel angry. How about you?\u000a Sad.\u000a Sad is another really good word for it. I would be furious, if we used our exciting words for our writing. But I would also be really disappointed. Maybe kind of flattered that someone liked my idea so much they put it on their own shirt, but it's the same thing. Is it wrong to steal someone's bicycle?\u000a Yes.\u000a You think it's wrong. Why is it wrong to steal someone's bicycle?\u000a Because that was just like stealing. You steal without even asking.\u000a Right. And that would hurt someone's feelings and it's illegal. Is it wrong to steal someone's pencil? Is it wrong to steal someone's pencil? Is it wrong to steal someone's pencil? Why is wrong to steal someone's pencil?\u000a Because it's their property.\u000a Because it's their property and it's not yours. So stealing someone's ideas is the same idea. So when you go to write your stories, boys and girls, and the reason we're writing our own stories is because we're making this our own. We're making this our own design. And I think that's really important for us to remember, because the more that you use your own ideas, the better it is for you. You have all these ideas in your heads, and I know you all have wonderful creativity, so we're writing our own stories. We're not taking the story of a TV show you saw last night like SpongeBob and you're not making a SpongeBob story. I want this to be your own idea. So we have Aliens in the Library, and we have our half here. You're a librarian, you hear a strange noise, it sounds like  screeching rats in a blender, what should you do? We decided our two choices were open the door or hide under your desk. If you open the door, you see the cutest little alien standing in the doorway. I think we had a majority of people here, I don't know if everyone here likes the cutest little alien idea, but this is our story and we're sticking with it. It has a big pink bow in her hair, antennae, and a pink polka dot dress. What do you do? You could either invite her in or slam the door in fright. You invite her in. She, surprisingly, speaks your language. She explains that her name is Lott and she became stranded when her spacecraft crashed. She asks if she can come home with you. What do you do? You have two choices here. You can either take her home or find another place for her to stay. Lott is a great house guest, she even helps with the dishes. You're glad you decided to take a chance on making a new intergalactic friend. You guys have seen this before. We made this story, and I'm not going to go over this story again and again, but I wanted to review with you what we talked about because over here, I'm going to show you what the final product is going to look like. This is what the story is going to be made. We did PowerPoint together. You're familiar with PowerPoint. We've done dozens of PowerPoints by now, at least. And so, on our screen here I'm going to open up my document that I made while you were gone, and it is what the PowerPoint is going to look like when you're finished. It is a choose your own adventure PowerPoint. And this is showing that you've mastered the skill of being able to use PowerPoint. You need to show me that you understand how to use this. This is kind of like our, I would say our final exam for PowerPoint so we know we can move onto the next thing, or the next project, the next exciting idea that we're going to do. So while this is loading, you're going to see that there are hyperlinks, and we're going to work on those as well, which will take you to different parts of your document. So up here we have Aliens in the Library by Mrs. Albright. I chose pictures that are graphics from PowerPoint, or from Clipart. The reason I did that is because we own those. I did not take them from the internet and drag them here. What happens if you take them from the internet and drag them here? They're someone else's ideas, remember? They're someone else's pictures. Yes.\u000a You have to put the date and you have the put the website. We have to, what do we call it? Cite those. But we're not even going to do the citation because this is more about the writing of the project. So we're going to do that instead. My Aliens in the Library. I'm going to show you the start of this, and then you're going to go start writing your own story. So here's my Aliens in the Library story. Now, the best one from this class, the one that we find, or two, that we like the best, we're going to put on my website so the younger students can access these from home, which I think is a really great idea. These are not going to be graphic or bloody. You can have some things happen, but you can't have guts falling out and eyeballs popping out of heads. Okay? Because this is for a young... you have to remember your audience. This is for first and second graders to use in the library when they come. So we are not going to make a big, bloody, messy, gory story. Okay? We're going to make cute little alien stories, apparently. This is what we made last time together... All right. You are a librarian. You stay late one night working on your computer and you hear strange noises coming from the hallway. It sounds like rats in a blender. What should you do? We chose to do open the door. So when I click on the button that says open the door, it should take me to that page. Ta-da. You open a door and you see the cutest little alien standing in the doorway. She has a big pink bow in her hair and antennae, and a purple polka dot dress. What do you do next? We're going to invite her in. If we invite her in, she actually speaks your language. She explains that her name is Lott and she became stranded on Earth when her spaceship crashed. She asks if she can come home with you. What do you do? I want to see what you guys pick for this one. Who wants to pick one? Who wants to pick a direction? What are we going to do, take her home or find her another place to stay?\u000a Find her another place.\u000a Find her another place? Let's see what we decided for that part of the story. You hear her shuffle down the hallway. You may have missed the chance of a lifetime to meet an alien, but at least you are safe. The end. Now notice my ends always go back to the beginning. So this is PowerPoint, that you're familiar with, used in a different way. Are there any questions about what we did here? Yes.\u000a How do you get the green buttons?\u000a That's what we're going to talk about, and that's a new part of the skill that we're working on, but right now, we're going to just be making these. I'm handing out these. You're going to be in your groups and we're going to start writing our stories. After you're checked and over there, you'll make your PowerPoints, and I'll help you with your hyperlinks individually in your tables.\u000a Does it...\u000a I'm sorry, she's talking.\u000a Does it have to be Aliens in the Library?\u000a No, no. No, no, no. That's a great question. It can be anything you want. Any kind of story that you're interested in. As long as it is not ...\u000a Bloody or gory.\u000a Bloody or gory or ...\u000a Violent.\u000a Violent, or, what's the other thing that we just talked about?\u000a Inappropriate.\u000a Inappropriate or guts, you guys are really stuck on the guts.\u000a Copyright.\u000a Copyrighted by somebody else. I wanted to show you a couple other ones that you can choose when you come for book exchange. One of them looks like this. This is actually a non-fiction choose your own adventure about George Washington crossing the Delaware, and it's about you changing history which I think is a really neat idea. If you're not much of a reader, but you still wanted to read some books, this one is very similar to actually, what we're making here in PowerPoint. It has graphics, it's called a graphic novel, and there are different pieces that look almost like comic books. I have several of these also. I have the newer versions of the old ones that I showed you and read out loud. The ones from 1986, remember I told you how I liked them when I was a kid, a few years ago? This one just has new covers on it, so if you're looking for those. And then this last one, this is a brand new series that I'm hoping to get more on, it's called The Golden Path and it's the same idea, just different characters and a different set of authors that made those. So if you're looking for a choose your own adventure story, and you go to type it in the library catalog, you can type in choose your own adventure. The problem with that is you need to know how to spell adventure.\u000a A-D-V-E-N-T-U-R-E.\u000a That's exactly right. Thanks, I wasn't even expecting that. The other thing to remember when we're keeping in mind, I'm going to be coming around to help you with your PowerPoints. Remember, we have to use that rubric, that rubric. Show me that you know what I'm talking about. Which rubric am I talking about? Show me. Show me your papers. Yes. This is the one that you need to do. Also, you can put that down. This other one that I want you to remember, the other thing to keep in mind, is we color coded these and we numbered them. The slides need to go in the order that you need it to be. This is a review of PowerPoint, so this shouldn't be anything new that you haven't seen before. This is kind of our graduation project for PowerPoint so that we can move on to the next project, next time. So we're working with PowerPoint. Who remembers how to insert a text box? What were the directions? We went over this before, and we went over it a couple different times. How do we insert a text box?\u000a You go to insert, you go over under the text box, click on it, and then you'll drag it and there it is.\u000a There it is. And how do you make it change color? Does anyone remember how we make it change color? How do we make it change color? We're on insert and text box. And make sure you make one down here. Yep. And then you can type in it, and then you do what with it? That's not wanting to cooperate is it? That's okay. Let's work on this one together. If you click on text box, you make the text box and you start typing in it. Who remembers how we change the color of the text box? That's what we're going to need to be able to do for our buttons and our hyperlinks that we talked about. Who remembers?\u000a You double-click on the box and it will show up...\u000a Right. You double click on the box, or sometimes even triple click until you get those three a's at the top, then you can change your color. I'll be around to help you. Are there any questions about this right now? Anyone have anything that they want to talk about before we get started. Every slide has to have a picture. What happens if you do not have a picture that you like from Clipart? What do you do? I want you, I'm encouraging you to use Clipart because it's something that's already there and we don't have to worry about where the source came from. But what do we do if you want to find a different picture somewhere else? What do we do?\u000a Find your picture.\u000a You can find your picture under Google images. Then what do we do?\u000a Then you copy it and then you put it back, and then we copy the source.\u000a You have to have the source. Very good. Very, very good. Okay. If you would like to have a whole separate slide with sources, you can do that. And we've done that before.\u000a And the date.\u000a And the date is very important. I'm glad that you remembered that. Okay, so I'll be around to help you, go ahead and get started back again on your project. Make sure the slides are in order. Do you want to format your designs? You go under design, you two can agree on a color scheme. Do you like that one? That's good. Let's look back at your thing. Let me see which one was number two. That was number three. Click on number two. And it should be, exactly, boys, look at how you did that. You put the words at the top, now I did check the word vial on yours and it's spelled wrong. V-I-A-L. Maybe my writing is hard to read. And then you have the two text boxes here at the bottom. If something gets stuck, can I have you guys be the experts and go over and help them?\u000a Sure.\u000a Okay, great. Thanks. Yes.\u000a Can you help us?\u000a Sure. What's the problem?\u000a We can get \u000a Well this one we want to get rid of. Remember, when you go to do the insert and you insert a new slide, you want to make sure that the layout is the title only. Remember how we talked about that one? So you want to insert the text box. You show me, what do we do? Right. And then what do we do? Okay, so you drag it. What are you typing in there? Okay. So you need how many text boxes then? Exactly. All right, so you go ahead and type in there so you can show me you know what to do with that. Can you click on it and then, use typing? Upstairs. Okay, now you want to, how do we make sure you pull that up? There you go, Are you okay with all the pink?\u000a I don't care.\u000a Good. Make sure everyone's input is added, though. Maybe he can help with the graphics. Everyone needs to be able to do something. We have to make sure this is fair for everybody. You're working the mouse, you're working the keyboard and he's holding the paper. Let's maybe switch it up a little bit closer, okay? So everyone has a turn.\u000a

V Where do I have more potential energy, at position A, or position B, Matt?\u000a  Position A.\u000a Why?\u000a  Because it's fully stopped before it's there, it's already moving a little bit.\u000a What else? Why does this point here, point A, have more potential energy than point B? So this is A, this is B. Does everyone agree that position A has more potential energy? Raise your hand if you agree with that. Okay. Now who can tell me why, why does position A have more potential energy than position B?\u000a  It has more potential to do work.\u000a Why, has potential to do work, yes, why?\u000a  It has a greater height.\u000a It has a greater height. Who mentioned gravitational potential energy at the beginning of the class?\u000a  I did.\u000a Okay, so going back to GPE. When you have a pendulum swinging back and forth, types of energy that are involved are kinetic energy, and potential energy, specifically. We can say that the potential energy is representing gravitational potential energy. If you focus your attention here. What is that?\u000a  A pendulum?\u000a  A pendulum. Similar to what you have here. Actually, you guys within the next week, you'll actually be working with the simulation, it's effect simulation, they're online. They're free for you to use and they're nice because they allow you to play. I know you like to a play a lot.\u000a  I like to play.\u000a  Yes, Matt.  You will be working with this, but I just wanted to show you another application of this, just in a different format. When we swing the pendulum what's going to happen?\u000a  It's gonna move.\u000a  It's going to move and at point here. And here, let's say A and B, what type of energy is being represented?\u000a Potential.\u000a  Potential energy. Who can tell me where kinetic energy is going to be represented? You wanna come up?\u000a  Sure. Between A and B.\u000a So every place along the path between A and B. Does everyone agree with Ali?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Yes, okay. Where is gravitational potential energy at its max? Wanna go up and point?\u000a At points A and B.\u000a Right, so everyone agree on the two ends? Where would kinetic energy be at its max? Where is kinetic energy at its max?\u000a Right here.\u000a Why?\u000a Because it's lowest.\u000a What else? So we said here, let's label this point C, we already used A and B. Why is kinetic energy at its maximum value at this point here?\u000a  That's when the potential energy is at its lowest.\u000a Great, that's where potential energy, the gravitational potential energy, is at its lowest. And if you remember or can recall the kinetic energy formula, what does the formula state? What variables involved in the kinetic energy formula, Matt?\u000a  Mass and velocity.\u000a Mass and velocity. What can you infer about the velocity of the pendulum as it's swinging along its path back and forth, from A to B? What can we infer about the kinetic energy?\u000a  It's terminal velocity is .\u000a Well, we're not gonna say terminal velocity, the object isn't falling, it's attached. What can we conclude about the velocity at point C, any thoughts? Garrett?\u000a  Greatest.\u000a  It's at its greatest. When the pendulum is at this point, it stops at each point A and B, our two end points, it stops for a split second because it has to do what? Maddy, did you say it?\u000a  Turn around.\u000a It has to turn around. When it swings back down, what's happening to the velocity? Is it increasing or decreasing? Increasing, so if the velocity is increasing, what's gonna happen to the kinetic energy value? It's also going to increase. Now, if I show you a graphical representation. Who can describe the graphical representation?\u000a  Like a downward .\u000a Okay. Ali?\u000a As it moves I guess it swings back and forth, the kinetic energy when it reaches the middle point, it's the highest and then when it reaches points A and B the potential energy gets highest.\u000a So does this simulation validate the thoughts and ideas you just came up with?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Yes and we see that through the representation of the graphical information of your potential energy and kinetic energy. I can stop it at certain areas. Sometimes it comes out better than others. It is somewhat on its way back, but just note that the kinetic energy is lower than the potential energy. And if I'm really good I can maybe try and get it in the middle. Close enough, it's hard to stop it right in the center. But you notice that the potential energy does what?  Decreases and your kinetic energy will?\u000a  Increase.\u000a Increase rather. And you said that the kinetic energy will be at its max at point C. One other factor that's involved here. There is one other type of energy or form of energy that's involved, can anyone think of it? Celini?\u000a  Thermal.\u000a Thermal energy.\u000a  Mechanical?\u000a Mechanical.\u000a  Thermal.\u000a  Thermal. Garrett, you had your hand up.\u000a  Thermal.\u000a  Thermal. Who agrees with thermal? Raise your hand.\u000a  Wait, actually no.\u000a Is there thermal energy involved in the motion of a pendulum?\u000a  No.\u000a That's mechanical. Thermal. If you're saying thermal energy, what form of thermal energy is represented here with the pendulum? What is the pendulum doing right now? It's moving through the?\u000a Air.\u000a Air. When objects move through the air, what can occur? Or what is present? Air resistance, which is a form of?\u000a  Friction.\u000a  Friction. Is or is not friction an example of heat energy?\u000a  Is.\u000a Or thermal energy? Yes, so is it possible for us to have some thermal energy present?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Yes. Now how come it's not showing up on the graph?\u000a  There's no friction.\u000a There's no friction. So what I like about this, and like I said, you guys will be using the simulation. And one of the options you have is to change the value for friction. Right now I have no friction so it's not showing up on the grid. So if I increase the friction you're going to see how the value for thermal energy will change. Also, when you apply or work with the simulation, you can actually change the mass of the ball, or the pendulum in the length of the pendulum itself. And those are factors that you will investigate and collect data on in the upcoming days. So let's add some friction. Let's go about halfway. What's happening to the friction?\u000a  It's increasing.\u000a  It's increasing on every swing.\u000a It's increasing with every swing.\u000a  And the pendulum is not reaching points A and B anymore.\u000a And the what?\u000a  It's not reaching points A and B anymore.\u000a Why, what's happening here, we have all these types of forms of energy, what's happening?\u000a  The air resistance slowing it down.\u000a The air resistance could be slowing it down. Want a little more?\u000a  Falls away.\u000a Lots of friction, and what's gonna happen? Ali?\u000a  Losing particles?\u000a It's not losing particles, I'm not losing any mass. We're not changing the mass, we're not changing the particles if there's a great deal of friction.\u000a  It's losing energy.\u000a It slows down. Does it lose energy?  How many of you think it loses energy? Raise your hand. How many of you think otherwise? What happens to the energy that was present? We had colorful bars, Matt said it's colorful. We had colorful bars representing kinetic energy and potential energy. Now we have these great big red bars, representing thermal energy and the total energy is thermal right now. What happened in this simulation? Ali?\u000a I don't know that, but because in the definition of thermal energy that's the total potential or kinetic energy in an object.\u000a So there is potential and kinetic energy involved, yes. Steven, you wanna try and help him out?\u000a  The energy gets transferred to thermal?\u000a Exactly, the energy gets transferred to thermal energy. What does the word transfer mean? Or transform, what does that mean? You know the movie Transformers? You guys are not too young for that right? I had a Transformer. I did. Jessica.\u000a  It changes?\u000a  It changes. If we were to come up with a new concept today explaining what happened, what could we say that we learned about the energies involved? What would be the main concept, the thing you just learned which Steven and Jessica proceeded? What happened to the energies, who can restate what they just stated, Matt? Or maybe give a definition. Energy is?\u000a  Transferred, but not lost.\u000a Okay, energy can be transferred or transformed and energy is not lost. So what you learned right now is that energy can be transformed into other forms of energy. Would you agree with that statement? Raise your hand if you agree. And what does the word transform mean?\u000a Bella?\u000a  Change.\u000a  Good, change. So you changed. We began with what kind of energy at this position? Elaine.\u000a  Potential.\u000a  Potential. Ailsa, it changed to?\u000a  Kinetic.\u000a  Kinetic, it changed to?\u000a  Potential.\u000a  Potential. Changed back to?\u000a Kinetic.\u000a Kinetic, and we also have some thermal energy involved. Is everyone clear on that concept? What you're going to do with your group, get out a sheet of paper, a piece of scrap paper. Or you could use the back of your packet is fine, there's a blank spot on there. One paper.\u000a  Per group?\u000a  Per group.  Okay, what you're going to do. I'm showing you two objects, I brought in props for you guys today. Real life, this is my toaster from home.\u000a  Aw.\u000a  Is it a brave little toaster? \u000a What I want you to do, you have two examples. Stand and look at the fan because it is plugged in, it is turned on, the blades are moving. What I want you to do to these two objects, I want you to write down the forms of energy that you think are involved with these appliances or objects, but what I want you to do is take it a step further. I want you to tell me or place in order, what type of energy do you begin with and then maybe with one to two types of energy or forms of energy that are transformed. So you begin with, you might have a thought, what type of energy do I begin with in order for the toaster to work? What type of energy did the fan begin with in order for it to turn on? And I want you to list the types of forms of energy involved and then put them in the order of transformation. You're gonna get about two to three minutes to do this. I would like every person in the group to participate. You all should be able to share your ideas freely. Respect what other people are saying, and then come to a consensus and write down your idea and your energies. Any questions before you begin? Any questions? Okay. \u000a See, it like stops here . Like that's potential energy and . \u000a Well, if you look at the fan, I purposely turned it on. So the blades are doing what? They're moving. Are they doing work? Yes. Base your forms or types of energy on what you see. The blades are moving, it is turning, okay? If you want to list the energy you begin with, put an arrow, put the next form of energy, put an arrow. Put the next form of energy to show the consecutive transformations of your energy that's involved with the two objects. Is it turning right now? Do you all agree on that? I would spend a little time sharing some ideas about that.\u000a Wait, wait, wouldn't they both be nuclear energy?\u000a Nuclear energy?\u000a Yes, because it's .\u000a Think about your definition of .\u000a  Here you put the energy for toaster.  I would write it down. Sucked in. I don't have the jolt in that, look. I don't have the toaster plugged in.  Don't burn yourself. But let's look and observe. Three of you, do you feel anything?\u000a Yes, do you see all those little black pointy things, when you put something in there and you turn it on? I don't know what you call those things, but they like...\u000a The coil?\u000a Yeah, the coil, yeah.\u000a \u000a Yes, they do! That's how you generate the heat.\u000a If you had the toast it would turn on.\u000a How about in the oven, coils inside, what colors do they turn?\u000a Orange. They turn orange, the same thing.\u000a They turn orange? So do you think that there's a form of energy involved here?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Magnetic. That's right?\u000a Oh!\u000a But you discovered it on your own.\u000a

V  What you just said. They're going to go back together.\u000a Well, I've glued them down so they can't. The green and the red charts are locked down in place. They can't get back, but I've taken up the orange field.\u000a  Wouldn't it generate a new field?\u000a They're going to make a new field and that new field will be?\u000a  \u000a Say it again. Oh, like the earlier drawing?\u000a  \u000a We can actually say a little more than that. In this vicinity here?\u000a  \u000a They'll be trying to pull each other back together. So, we're going to end up with a field that's exactly opposite . What we did was they move around. \u000a  As long as it's still running.\u000a They move apart until the field is basically nullified.\u000a  Let's look at one more example.\u000a  Do you have one more potato shape in there?\u000a  Most people.\u000a  Most people, right. So, let's start for this last one, let's look at this shape and say that I observe fields coming out like that. Write down a couple of observations before you make your prediction. Based on what you're seeing in there, what can you say about what you see? \u000a Are those lines all supposed to be straight?\u000a  Yeah. To the best of my drawing ability they're horizontal, parallel lines. My drawing was perfect.\u000a Mr. Shields, what ?  \u000a  They're going in two directions.\u000a  The orange?\u000a  Yeah, the orange one.\u000a  Like a very large plate.  \u000a  It could be just a potato in there and that's . \u000a  The thing in your hand.\u000a  This one?\u000a  Yep.   \u000a  Okay, let's take a look. Chris, can I get you to shut the door to keep the noise down? We'll give you a break in about 10 minutes or so. It's nice to have the extra period here. First thing before we talk about this new one, I failed to address Hannah's question and good insight earlier. Yes, . The orange lines in here will be drawn into the negative and they're going to bend and  will be coming outward   from the positive end. So, you're definitely going to see this sort of pattern. I think people saw a little bit of that in the simulations. Anytime you've got a conducting material... Anytime you've got a conducting material the field lines always intersect exactly perpendicular with . It's a conductor. So, it definitely makes a difference when you call it a conductor and look at what happened in the field. Let's talk about this new one. There's a couple of observations. Ian give me one observation and Claire give me the second observation.\u000a Besides the fact that the lines are straight.\u000a  No, that's a good one. The lines are straight. Very important. Claire?\u000a They're going in opposite directions.\u000a  Exactly opposite directions. Okay, Hakim give me another one.\u000a Well, the lines are coming out of it.\u000a  Okay, they're coming outward not inward. Good.\u000a To indicate that the .\u000a  Okay, so that one we know from the very first piece here. The net charge is positive. The fact that they're horizontal.\u000a They indicate like a plate or something.\u000a Yeah, is it like two parallel plates? \u000a  Two parallel plates? So, where would you draw them? Above and below?\u000a There are two on top.\u000a  So, like above and below like this?\u000a  Four plates.\u000a  Four plates. Let's make it 16. \u000a But if you had a plate and the thing is neutral or no net charge and then they would just...\u000a But what if you had one positive plate straight up and down the middle, then it would push away on both sides.\u000a Two positive plates .\u000a Two plates sounds twice as good as one, but I'm not sure that it is. Four plates sounds even more appealing. An infinite number of plates sounds fantastic. I'm hearing good ideas here. I want you guys to think about what it would look like in different scenarios. So, two positive plates.   Okay, two positive plates and I'm looking at the vicinity in the middle here, is that right? And do I want my two positive plates to be on the sides?\u000a  Negative plates.\u000a  Well, negative plates, okay. Two negative plates on the sides like this so the field would look like what?\u000a Bend.\u000a  Okay, we're getting a bending because if I draw it here--\u000a But you still have to compare .\u000a  It'd be like this kind of a picture?\u000a It'd still be bent. Greater than the distance.\u000a  Okay, so you've got... So, based on that you've got some things going on above and below that should be penetrating into that shape.\u000a What about two infinitely long?\u000a  Two infinitely long plates. Both negative? What would the field look like? Forge the potato shape. What would the field look like in the vicinity of two infinitely long, evenly charged negative plates?\u000a Wouldn't they go ?\u000a  If I take a single positive test charge and release it right in the middle, what would it do?\u000a  \u000a  What if I release it a little bit to the left side?\u000a  \u000a  An infinitely long plate. We derived this one before, a single one. Remember the equation for the field or the general shape of the field from an infinite plane?\u000a  It's constant.\u000a  It's a constant, exactly right. Brittany didn't even have to look at her notes on that one. But you remember, what was our analogy to an infinitely large plate?\u000a  \u000a  Yeah, gravity on the earth here, you know, big flat earth. I don't care how far above the ground I am, it's the same number, it doesn't change at all. That's exactly right. So, an infinite plate, the field is some number, another identical infinite plate, it nullifies it. So, in the same charge, okay? Well, that isn't going to work.\u000a  Infinitely far.\u000a Infinitely far away from each other.  When Brittney says it's a constant, even if you go to infinity, I guess it'd still be a constant, either that or you go to zero.\u000a It would be two sets, one set like that except that they are horizontal and vertical and they're infinitely far away where .\u000a Two horizontal plates like this?\u000a Yeah, because . \u000a I don't think that's going to work either. Ben, you're getting agitated back there. And what are you saying?\u000a We were just talking.\u000a You're saying there's no way in the world they can be infinite. Is that what you're saying?\u000a Yeah. \u000a  \u000a You can't have an infinite plane anything because you're defining the shape?\u000a  So, that's a good question. When I've got the shape here, do we require that the thing that I'm talking about fit inside of the shape?\u000a  No.\u000a  I'm going to say no. Okay, so does that change your answer? Okay. I think we can and will look at situations where the surface... And remember this is all leading up to that Gaussian surface idea we mentioned on Friday. Where the Gaussian surface does not fully enclose an object. Like an infinite plane, we need to be able to study those even though I can't fit it inside of a box. So, we have to expand a little bit to the possibility that whatever it is is inside of there.\u000a An infinitely long positive plate right in the middle.\u000a  Right in the middle. Is that what you said about seven minutes ago?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  I tried to ignore him because I didn't want you guys to get the answer too quick. But I do want to acknowledge him . Yeah, tell me if this makes sense and why? Somebody besides John and Ian. It doesn't make sense that I've got a plate and this is slicing my potato in half and it's a positive plate.\u000a  Would it have to be infinitely long?\u000a  Much longer . \u000a If I don't... Now, I'm not very good at drawing in 3D so is the potato lines, are they diverging this way at all? I can't tell. They're uniform this way, parallel lines this way, so we know that it has to be infinite this way. And not have divergence this way .\u000a  \u000a Well, I didn't draw any lines coming out of the . Do they have to be parallel to the ones that are on the board or would they be diverging? That's going to change the answer that you give. If I draw another red line that's coming like this, that's clearly diverging from this red line. So, I'm going to assume that every line, for this problem, every line that I draw is parallel and then we'll get a new .\u000a  Perpendicular with the plate.\u000a  Yeah, perpendicular to the board. And then all positive coming out both sides. Very good. Alright, I've got one more drawing on there I want to hit and then we'll just say some fantastic summary words and then I'll give you guys a break. The last one here, instead of the three dimensional shape, now all I've got is a single sheet of paper. And this sheet of paper I've got, I noticed...  I noticed parallel lines, arrows, coming straight out of that shape. Write down a couple of observations on it quick and then see if you can predict, based on what you observed here, what and where, if you want to, what the source of the field lines is. What can we learn from the electric field lines?  \u000a  They're all coming out parallel in one direction.\u000a  Yes, parallel in one direction.  One direction. They're parallel this way and they're parallel this way also. So, they're normal to the surface everywhere.\u000a Are they coming from the other side?\u000a  All I see is lines penetrating this way, so I could actually draw them like this and that's fine.\u000a Do you know anything about the other side of the plate, like is there anything there?\u000a  It's a two dimensional structure and the arrows penetrate.\u000a Oh, okay.\u000a  Yeah, they're not diverging at all. Yeah, uniform, orthogonal, all that good stuff.     \u000a  Into the paper?\u000a So, they're coming out of here?\u000a  They're going into here and coming out here.\u000a Oh, okay.\u000a To the differences, that's a closed shape. This is a two dimensional surface. If I had wrapped it around like this it would make a difference, right?  \u000a Okay guys, let's see what we've got here. I'm going to ask Paul first, Emily second, and then we'll see if Michael can go for the trifecta.\u000a Oh no.\u000a  No pressure. You can be wrong, it's alright. Paul, what is, based on your observations, what is the thing that you think is the source of the electric field here? Where is it coming from that it makes this pattern in this object, on this sheet?\u000a I think this is like the second or the third example we did when it was passing through.\u000a  Where they're just passing through?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  So, then where do you think it's coming from? What does that tell you about the source of the electric field?\u000a I'm not sure.\u000a  You have more to say?\u000a No.\u000a  Emily, give it a try.\u000a Since it's positive on this side?\u000a  Yup.\u000a You can see that there might be a positive charge .\u000a  Okay, so if I had a positive charge on this side, I would get electric field lines going like this? That's correct, okay.\u000a Or if you had a negative charge .\u000a Ah okay, so you're answering two things, which is pretty overachieving, but I like it that you're saying that instead of a positive back here, it could be a negative over here. Okay, now there's something incomplete about what you're saying. The positive here versus there could be a negative here, that's a great insight that it could be one or the other, but Michael's going to help us out because you're a little incomplete on what you're telling us.\u000a They have to be infinite.\u000a  Infinite. Infinitely strong charge.\u000a Infinitely long, whatever, a plane.\u000a A plane, yeah. A plane back here that's infinitely large, distributive charge that's positive. That's the only way to get a uniform field here. Can it work with what Emily was saying about it could be a negative over here? It could be an infinitely long thing here? There's one more option. Does anybody ?\u000a It could be intro .\u000a  That this piece of paper here is neutral?\u000a And you could just put a new positive charge.\u000a  But be careful. Any positive charge, if I start off with the very first drawing, and I look at what happens when I put a sheet here, the field lines are like this.   They're diverging. I'm not having divergence here at all. So, it can't come from any old point source. We are going to assume that this thing is neutral though. Okay, that itself is not... It's just capturing the story of what's going on. Hannah?\u000a Could there be both a positive and negative along the plate?\u000a  Yeah, you can have both. You bet.\u000a  That seems like a little bit of overkill, but as long as you're making your sheet infinite in size, you might as well make two infinite's.\u000a You have all your infinite .\u000a  That's right. And two parallel plates, two plates that are parallel to each other, one positive, one negative, is a very common thing. So common in fact that it's on my tie today. Oh yeah, there it is. See that?  Hakim, do you have a question?\u000a Okay, so it's the positive plane that's standing or negative plane?\u000a  Yeah, the infinite plane.\u000a The infinite plane. I was about to say that. That it would be infinite.\u000a  Yeah, I think Michael was saying that it would probably be. Not the charge distribution, the sigma, how much charge per unit area will be some number, but it would just keep on going on. Chris?\u000a \u000a  Yeah, you know, that would be a lot.\u000a \u000a  Reasonably speaking, if something goes to infinity, all of your homework is easy. So, there's no purpose for me doing that. What is the answer? Infinity or zero. It's got to be one. Infinitely large in size with a uniform charge distribution does add up to an infinite charge, but it's distributed infinitely far away. So that's okay. Now, remember the goal of this as we were getting into this today, is to figure out what can we learn from an electric field? And here's the thing. In the first three or four examples or five I guess for some people, if I take a closed surface I can learn a lot. Not everything necessarily, but I can learn about what's inside of that. Infinitively, is the first one positive?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Yes. The next one that I drew was negative, absolutely. This most recent closed surface, it had to be a positive plate shoved in there. This last one with just a two dimensional structure to measure with, to gauge what's happening, I don't know everything. We've got a lot of ambiguity. And this is why with Gauss' law we need to use this closed surface. We need to look at it from all sides. We need to be fully envelop in what's going on or else we might miss something. We'll go back again. The equation that I showed you last week, we'll put that on the board in a few minutes when we come back from a break as well as looking at a couple of scenarios, just conceptually how we can draw these things to capture all that field. Go ahead and take a break and be back in five minutes.\u000a

V It's big.\u000a  Okay.\u000a And that's all, and the little blood cells, and I drew one on there, in kinda like a magnified, and there's little blood strands, they're blood strands, DNA strands.\u000a  Now, those DNA strands are only in the blood? Are they anywhere else in your body?\u000a They're in your hair and in your fingernails, in your skin, they're everywhere.\u000a  Okay, so it's not just in the blood?\u000a But you usually get it from the blood. Blood. \u000a Okay, alright. It looks like you've got a couple questions. You can call on whoever you want.\u000a Me?\u000a Are these questions? You guys, are these questions for Ryan? Okay.\u000a  How do you know Chuck was right? \u000a  What?\u000a Well, he's a pretty smart guy.\u000a  Who?\u000a Chuck, my uncle.\u000a  Oh, okay. \u000a Maybe.\u000a Even though there's a bunch of DNA on the strand, what does that have to, how do you know that a piece of that DNA came from either the mom or the dad?\u000a That's why  because DNA comes from both of them. The dad gives the DNA and the mom provides the DNA. Okay, David?\u000a It was in the blood, right? You said it was in the blood, right?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Yes, but couldn't blood be transmitted to another person because they had the, yeah, it could be transmitted to another person, so that's not really a trait.\u000a  Sure, when someone gets a blood transfusion?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Right? Like if you're in the hospital and you're injured and you get blood transfusions? If your eyes are blue and you get a blood transfusion from a brown-eyed person, does that turn your eyes brown?\u000a  No.\u000a  It could, if .\u000a  Okay. Does it give you a widow's peak when you have a straight hairline?\u000a  No.\u000a Okay. If I get a blood transfusion tomorrow, hopefully that doesn't happen, but if I get a blood transfusion tomorrow, is that going to give me a cleft chin?\u000a  No.\u000a If the person had a cleft chin?\u000a  But how do people die when they get, when they get blood transfusions?\u000a Carlos, can we talk about that later maybe? Let's stick with how we get our traits. Do we get it through the blood? Okay, not really? Girls, what do you think over there?\u000a I was sure it had something to do with the blood , but that's between your parents, and it has nothing to do with the traits, so I don't know.\u000a  Do you want to come over here too?\u000a I want to come over there with the boys.\u000a Yes, I . \u000a  You guys are, you guys haven't even said anything yet, and already they're, they're joining your group. Okay, should we hear from the people who think, I've got a large . Lorenzo, do you want, should we hear from you? Or are you thinking about coming over to this group too? You're set, okay. Let's hear from Lorenzo. Okay, Lorenzo, what do you think?\u000a I think that it was  that brown-eyed people have more traits than blue-eyed people, because I know more people that are brown-eyed than blue-eyed, and I think I read somewhere that usually brown eye is a dominant trait over the blue eyes. So for most of the times, brown-eyed people, if you have brown-eyed parents, you will get brown eyes, but how is--\u000a  So you heard something about a dominant trait? Okay, any questions about that dominant trait? Brown eyes being dominant trait?\u000a Because a lot of people have brown eyes like that, and not many people have blue eyes.\u000a  True? Blue eyes are more rare? Okay. Lorenzo, whoever you want to call on, you've got two people.\u000a So like, what you were saying right now,  something about your parents, then you would get it from your parents?\u000a  Hmm.\u000a  What?\u000a Because when he was, when he was saying that, about the traits, he said you, if your parents have brown eyes or blue eyes, that you're gonna get that trait from them. So, from your parents, so--\u000a  Interesting. Do you get what she's saying?\u000a What?\u000a  She's, she's saying she's sticking with this group because it's coming from your parents. Okay.\u000a That's why they say it's half and half.\u000a  Okay.\u000a Also, I'm in your group too, but what's it called?\u000a  \u000a Yeah, I see more brown eyes, but still, they always get their traits from the parents, not only--\u000a  But a lot of people have, some people still get blue eyes, and then others, it's because of, they still get the traits from the parents, and some of them don't look alike, so--\u000a What about, what about, some people have, both of the parents have brown eyes, and some of the kids turn, they have their blue eyes, though.\u000a  Yeah, that's great, because that's a great, how many of you guys have seen something like that?\u000a I have seen it.\u000a  Where two parents have one trait and then their kid has the opposite trait? Like brown-eyed parents, blue-eyed kid? You guys have seen that? Why does that happen? What do you think?\u000a I'm not really sure. I know my parents have brown eyes, and me--\u000a And you have green eyes.\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Your parents both have brown eyes, right? And your eyes are blue?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, so why does that happen? Lorenzo, since it was your idea let's hear from you.\u000a If I'm correct, there's more brown-eyed traits, so you get, if you have a brown-eyed parent and a blue-eyed parent, you get a brown-eyed trait and a blue-eyed trait, but because brown-eyed is dominant, most of the time, you get brown-eyed. But you still have blue-eyed traits, so even if you have two parents with brown-eyed trait, if they both also have the blue-eyed trait, you could get blue eyes.\u000a  I have a question for you, Lorenzo. You keep using this word, dominant trait. Does, in your mind, does dominant mean more?\u000a  More?\u000a  When you're saying more traits, in your mind, does dominant mean there's more of it?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, what do you guys, how many of you guys have heard this word, dominant?\u000a  There's recessive, too, which is--\u000a Recessive? Okay, does dominant mean more? Anyone know that?\u000a It means power over the others.\u000a Like an overpowering trait, he's trying to say.\u000a Are you trying to say more? Are you trying to say more or are you trying to say stronger?\u000a  Stronger.\u000a  Okay, so this group, the group you're sitting in, the group one, right now, is someone who thinks that there's more traits, come from the brown. Do you think that? You're not sure?\u000a Say yes.\u000a  But you know something about dominant? Okay.\u000a  I'll stay with my group.\u000a  Yes?\u000a  Can I make my own  group where it's like--\u000a  Yeah!  Good, yes. What are you thinking?\u000a I'm moving.\u000a Maybe it's just maybe that nature decides what something will look like, because I don't know, my parents have brown eyes and I have blue eyes, and we don't really have anyone else who has blue eyes.\u000a  You're picking the--\u000a  Wait a minute.\u000a  Fiona, no. Olivia?\u000a Yeah, nature.\u000a Okay, nature makes, so you've got blue eyes, nature had something to do with that, not your parents?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay. Anyone want to respond to that?\u000a  Ryan?\u000a How does nature do that? How does nature choose your eye color?\u000a  Doesn't it have something to do with your parents?\u000a Of course , how could you just , a slot machine where it's like 'ching' and then the eye colors roll around and stuff? "Oh, you got blue eyes!"\u000a  I don't know .\u000a Let him respond. You're not sure?\u000a  No, I'm not sure. I'm still .\u000a Any other questions? \u000a  Oh, yeah?\u000a  And like, you know how, I was gonna ask this, what if you get it from your grandparents or your ?\u000a  Grandparents have black eyes.\u000a  Or from your aunts or something.\u000a  I really don't know.\u000a  If your aunts and sisters .\u000a  Yeah, what if his aunt and sister has blue eyes?\u000a That's right. What if somewhere way back, someone in your family had blue eyes?\u000a  You guys better .\u000a  I don't see how that .\u000a How does that happen? Does anyone know people who look like their grandparents?\u000a  Yeah, my cousin does.\u000a Lorenzo?\u000a My mom said that I look like my grandparent because I have a mole or something that's in the same spot as my grandpa.\u000a If that's the case for you, does that support what he's saying? Nature decides? Or does that keep you in what you're thinking?\u000a  It keeps me in.\u000a  But I have a question.\u000a Okay.\u000a How do people, one eye is blue and the other one is green?\u000a  Oh, I know that one.\u000a  That's a mutation.\u000a  No, no, some people have really--\u000a  Yeah, like--\u000a All right, let's refocus. Let's refocus. We haven't heard from this group. We haven't heard from the few groups that have the most amount of people in them. Okay, so let's give them a chance to talk. Ladies, can you start us off?\u000a You guys read it. I have to read it? \u000a  We agree that people get half their traits from their parents. We think this is a  trait from both of their parents. Also,  for example,  that--\u000a What? \u000a For example, if one person has, one parent has--\u000a  Because for example, for me, I have my dad's eyes and I have my mom's, my mom's .\u000a She has traits from, some from your mom and some from your dad, okay?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a It looks like you've got someone who wants to say something about that.\u000a  But if, what if you get more, if you get some traits from your ancestors too and not just your parents? What about your--\u000a That would just go back a generation, though.\u000a Does that still support what you're thinking?\u000a Yeah.\u000a No, because we're talking about the parents. How they have half.\u000a  Yeah, but you then also get from your parents, some of them, so some people don't look like their parents at all, but they look like someone else in their family.\u000a I'm seeing this issue come up again. What about grandparents? Kids who look like their grandparents. How does that happen? Does anyone here wanna, any of you guys? Go ahead.\u000a You still get it from your parents because your parents, if your grandma has it, then that trait is somewhere in your mom or your dad. It just doesn't show up as much, so it can transfer back to you.\u000a  What can we call that? That there's a trait in you and you just don't see it? Does anyone know a word for that?\u000a Invisible? \u000a  I heard it over here.\u000a  Recessive.\u000a  Yes, recessive, okay. Who else has heard recessive? Raise your hands. Scientists call a recessive gene a gene that does not express itself. It doesn't mean it's a little gene that's quiet. It just means that it's a gene that's not showing. Or a trait, sorry, a trait that's not showing. That's called recessive. You also want to talk about this more, a little bit more, let's stay on this topic. I think it will help us figure it out. Yes, Ryan?\u000a Like he was saying, it's probably about the DNA strands, when they, when two people  combine in different parts or put in different pieces of it, like maybe one, like maybe the blue eyes is out and brown eyes goes in there. Or maybe when they have one of those recessive genes, the recessive genes get, it goes into the strand too. Maybe when Tyler said that none of, neither of his parents have blue eyes, maybe his grandpa or his grandma or their grandparents, maybe one of them had blue eyes, and it was in his mom or his dad, and it went into the strand that he was created from.\u000a It didn't show up in the mom, but then it popped up in the kid?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay. David?\u000a  I don't know, I think, I don't know if I agree with him, but I think I kind of do because, like he said, it was dominant, but he still has, he still has a little bit in him, so it's kind of like a, well, because you still have, some of your traits, or your parents still kind of have a little bit.\u000a How are, okay, how are, how is this idea that brown-eyed kids have, I'm sorry, brown-eyed, there's more traits in brown eyes, right? Is that what this idea is about? All you guys right here? How is that like this one? That we get half from mom and half from dad? Or how can we use some of this thinking and layer it onto some of this thinking, so they're both right?\u000a  The question is how are those two the same?\u000a  Right.\u000a How are that one and this one the same?\u000a  How are pieces from this, how do we use pieces from this idea that Lorenzo is bringing up, dominant and recessive, how do we use pieces from this and combine it with pieces from this group over here? Let me get you to talk about that with your group. Let me ask, I'll ask that question one more time. What's right about what these guys are saying and how can we add it to stuff this group is thinking?\u000a  What if the kid is born blind, right?  Or what if the kid comes out deaf and blind?\u000a  some express themselves and some don't.\u000a Woo! That, you just gave me a brain scan because you read my mind.  Say there's two DNA strands. One in this hand, one in this hand. They combine. The dominant ones from each of these take over and make one of all the dominant ones that were in them.\u000a Can you give me an example ?\u000a With Tyler, maybe there was a dominant gene. The blue eyes was dominant. Maybe it was passive before it started, whatever it's called, recessive, and then it became dominant, but over time, and then it  went in Tyler.\u000a How can a dominant gene become a recessive gene and become dominant again?\u000a  Maybe  every time it gets passed down.\u000a  Hmm.\u000a  Like with us, we get bigger.\u000a What if your, if your mom had two blue-eyed parents, but Ryan here, today ?\u000a And they combine. I found it. \u000a  All right, are we ready to pull back? All right. I didn't get to hear from all, these two groups, but I did get to hear from them. I think what this group has is something good, and I think you guys want to hear it. , you're gonna be the spokesperson for that group? Great.\u000a We agree that people get mom and 50% from their dad. We think this because if there's two people who made the baby, then it's, logically, should be split in half. But all, every time someone has a baby, all of their genes of both parents go into the baby. Only some of them decide to express themselves and show.\u000a  Go ahead.\u000a Say I have two DNA strands from two different people. Say, Mary and Joe. Mary and Joe both had grandparents that both have blue eyes, and that gene got passed down to them. Now, they combined to make one gene. Say Mary had blue eyes, had a blue-eyed gene, and Joe had a blue-eyed gene. Those two genes combined to make one dominant blue-eyed gene and it goes in, like what Tyler, like with Tyler.\u000a  Right, so we, Tyler, he used you as an example. Your parents both have brown eyes, right?\u000a  Mm-hmm.\u000a  And what were you guys saying about, his parents both have brown eyes, but something, they had something else too?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Because everyone kind of has a little bit of everything in them, it's just some, some color or some trait just decides to show because it's more dominant.\u000a  You know the movie, you know the movie, , that movie? They went to some place and they went to go get,  found out, they got the book from some person and they matched it up to ours, and it was different colors, so they had different kind of genes for like, for things. So if you compare a baby who has blue eyes and one who has brown eyes, it's gonna have, it's gonna have different things with the eyes. The DNA thing will be different.\u000a  Maybe those DNA genes that, in a DNA, maybe they would look different for a blue-eyed person than a brown-eyed person?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Did you wanna say something?\u000a Maybe the DNA of Tyler's parents, for example, if their grandparents had blue-eyed DNA accumulating in them, it might have been passed down through them. And then when they got to where they were forming Tyler inside their, his mom's stomach , it might have, the blue DNA might have overpowered, combining those two blue DNAs by getting, it might have overpowered the brown eyes, which made Tyler get the blue eyes.\u000a   50%? It could be like 50%.\u000a  That happened in my family.\u000a They're saying, what color eyes are your parent's, Tyler? What's your mom's eye color?\u000a  Brown.\u000a Oh.\u000a  Yeah, what you got on your mom's side?\u000a From my brown-eyed mom?  Brown.\u000a  So what about your mom's mom? What about your dad's?\u000a  What about your dad?\u000a All right, you guys, let's talk. Let's talk for a second. If we've got an example of one person, in science, you never hang everything on one person. Let's be careful about that. And we don't want to have him be the reason for all. But this is a good example. Do we think that people can have genes in them that aren't showing, but then they can have a kid, and then those genes pop up?\u000a  Yeah, because if the two genes--\u000a Did you want to say something about it, Lorenzo?\u000a  Yeah, because I think that if a parent had brown eyes and one had blue eyes, but the brown-eyed parent also had some blue-eyed genes, then the baby would probably come out blue, because it has the blue-eyed gene and then half of the blue-eyed gene from the other parent.\u000a How could we figure out how we get our traits for sure? Because we have a lot of ideas, but what, in science class, what will we do? What kind of activity could we do? What kind of research could we do? How would we find out?\u000a We could go on AskJeeves.com and we-- \u000a So we could look it up on the Internet. Okay, guys, one resource we could look at. How else could we figure this out?\u000a We could take a survey.\u000a  Didn't we do that?  the class?\u000a  We did?\u000a  No. \u000a But we could  whole school so we have more to research, or more, I don't know.\u000a  Make a larger sample size. Then, we get information and we find out that X percent of our students have brown eyes and X percent of our students have blue eyes. How does that help us find out where those traits came from?\u000a  It gives us more of an idea--\u000a  Their parents and their grandparents too. And their great-grandparents.\u000a  We'd have to ask people to, we'd have to ask people to do some research on their families? Okay, so we could do some family research. Sonja?\u000a We could make up an assignment .\u000a  Sure.\u000a  \u000a  Okay.\u000a

V On a regular basis. Have you ever thought about what that causes? I mean, what causes wind to blow in the first place? Whether it be a breeze. Whether it be a hurricane. Whether it be a tornado. Would you take a few minutes in your notebook, would you just draw a line write after what you wrote?  And I want you to give your best explanation of what the heck causes wind? Just do this on your own first. What could cause wind to blow? Take a few moments, just on your own.  Just like always guys, you don't have to be right here. I just want to know anything that you think might contribute to wind blowing. On a big scale, on a small scale. Anything that you've got that we can build on, anything that you put down. Alright, when you have this discussion in a few moments, share your ideas with each other. And then remember one person will be called from the group to share either what you put down, or what somebody else did. Talk to each other. See what everyone there is thinking. What ideas do we have? \u000a The air pressure and temperature changes and so it kind of like shocks, and it creates wind.\u000a That's good. I think wind develops because clouds carries that air .\u000a I don't really know much. \u000a Alright, folks. When we go, let's use, let's see who gets to share. Person two. We're going to go with person two. And let me switch this over here real quick so I can write down some of your ideas. Hold on. Alright, where'd my pen go? Okay, here we go. Person two. And we're going to start over here. Did you guys have any ideas why wind to blow? No, table seven. Sorry.\u000a I don't know, but I said heat and cold air rising and falling. 'Cause I know how hang gliding gives us columns of air rising, heat rising, how you get in the air. I'm really not sure so I'm just thinking.\u000a  Okay, so something about hot air rising and cool air falling.\u000a  And like how they're .\u000a  Say that again.\u000a  And cold and hot air going over mountains. \u000a  Different land masses. Okay, very interesting. Now she had the toughest job. From now on every other person number two that goes you have to either come up with a different theory, a different idea, or you can agree or disagree with what Miah had to say. But you cannot say, "I don't know." Okay? So you gotta kinda run with what's been said. Keisha, we're going to go back to you first. What was your thought at your group?\u000a  Well, we agree with Miah because basically we said the same thing that like the temperature of the air can have something to do with the wind.\u000a  Okay. So I'm just going to add on here temperature.\u000a  I was going to add pressure.\u000a  Temperature, okay. That may be something different. Let's see what we can add to this. So you're agreeing with Miah that it may have something to do with the temperatures of the air. Yeah? Okay. Table three, you guys had a different kind of theory.\u000a We agree with what she said except we also thought the pressure  how the wind blows and stuff.  Okay, so you guys talked mostly about pressure.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Could you pass that up to table two? So far we have two theories. One has been agreed to already. We have temperature, pressure.\u000a Our group wasn't sure. But I agree with Kavya in how the pressure .\u000a  You're thinking that it's something do with pressure. And, okay there's an agreement here with temperature as well. Pass that up to table one. Prescott, what kind of ideas did you guys have?\u000a Well, we were talking and we kinda agree with A, or hot air rising. And pressure and air too, but I was thinking that currents or air currents carry the wind, or carry the air, faster.\u000a  Okay, so let me add something about currents in here. 'Cause that's another kind of interesting thing. So are currents separate from these two? Or the same? Or added on to? Or they another thing all together?\u000a Just added on, I guess.\u000a  Okay, so we've got temperature of the air, we've got pressure of the air, and we've got something to do with currents. Could you pass that over to Conner? Conner, what is your thought?\u000a  We kind of agreed that pressure of the air probably makes the wind. Like low pressure and high pressure.\u000a  You know that's an interesting thing with the low pressure. What would cause air to be different pressures?\u000a  I thought maybe the Earth's core and the gravity pulls down more in some places than others.\u000a  Okay so, let's see. So you're agreeing with pressure, and you're kind of saying the pressures have something to do with gravity. Really interesting. Oops, hang on. Something to do with gravity causing different pressures. Pass that back to David. David, what did your conversation involve?\u000a  Well, I thought the, I really didn't know exactly what makes the wind blow, but if I had to guess I'd say it's air masses meeting.\u000a  Let's put that down. Okay. Hold on. And you threw out something that says air masses meeting. Alright, so when you talk about air masses, give us more of what you thought of what that is. What do you mean an air mass? And when they meet, how would that produce wind?\u000a  Well, I know that when warm and moist air mass collides with a cool, dry air mass it forms a thunderstorm. I was thinking of one warm air mass meets another warm air mass, then when they collide it might produce wind. I don't know why, that's just my guess.\u000a  No, no that's fine. So you're thinking when, you're saying when two different kinds of air masses meet it makes a thunderstorm. But maybe when two of the same meet it makes wind.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So let me put that on. So air masses meeting. So since we're talking only about wind right now, it's the same kind of air mass meeting. Alright. Would you pass that back to... Ah, Nathan we're going to have you go since Amber already went today. Back over to Nathan. Nathan what did your conversation revolve around back there?\u000a  Well, we didn't really know, but based on what everyone said I agree with Miah, that it's the hot air rising and the cooler falling. But I also think that David's ideas are kind of interesting. I agree with A.\u000a  You're agreeing with A, that it has something to do with the temperatures.\u000a  Miah, what's your thought?\u000a  I also thought what David said, 'cause I know how tornadoes are formed. But then I thought air masses are way too big. And I know almost all over the continent get a lot of wind. And so I think it might have something to do with air meeting together. I think that has to do with hot and cold air, kind of mashing.\u000a  Okay so. You said with hot air rising and cool air falling. And then you said something about hot and cool air mashing. So when you talk about them mashing, are they like coming together and like swirling together? What do you mean by mashing?\u000a  Mixing, not mashing.\u000a  Mixing.\u000a  Yeah, just kind of colliding together, but not swirling.\u000a  Okay, so when you're saying hot air rising, cool air falling, you're saying that those two things are mixing, and it's by the mixing together that's what's causing the wind?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Okay. Guys take a second. I want you to talk, we've got two more tables to go. But I want you to take a few moments, talk about the theories that have been presented so far and see if your opinions change so far. And then any questions that come up based on it. Talk to each other.  Alright guys, about ten seconds. Everybody time. And three, two, and one. Great ideas so far, guys. Let's go to the last... Any questions or comments come up in your discussion that you just had? Yes.\u000a  Well, I think that if two of the same air masses meet it would just make a larger air mass. I mean if you're adding water with water, it's just making more water.\u000a  Huh, so you're saying instead of wind being created, you would just have a bigger one.\u000a  And I also think maybe it creates a thunderstorm if it's two of the different air masses, but maybe I think that would create wind like negative and positive magenets refusing to mix.\u000a  You're bringing a couple of interesting things. You're saying when a warm air mass and a cold air mass meet, you're saying that those are kind of like magnets. Like opposite sides attract? Am I understanding what you're saying?\u000a  Sorry, I mean both of the... I'm a little confused. Also, I would kind of agree with David now because if I'm thinking about magnets then two of the same magnets would refuse.\u000a  Right. So would that analogy be a wind refusing? Or would coming together be more like the wind?\u000a  I think that analogy would work with the two different temperatures of air mass, but there's, the magnets are the same, the air masses are...\u000a  That's really interesting when you go and you apply to analogy like a magnet like that, which is really cool to bring in. Let me get the two other theories and we'll come back to that.\u000a  How big are air masses?\u000a  Well, let me come back to that. Let me get the two others and make sure we get some other theories in. Richard, what'd you guys end up talking about? Did it change as you saw these ideas?\u000a  Yeah, so originally we were thinking that it might have something to do with gravity's movement. Actually, we thought it would probably be more something like a change in air pressure.\u000a  You know, I'm going to, because I think that's an interesting theory, I'm going to put it up here anyway. You said it had something to do with gravity and the movement of the planet itself. So with gravity and movement of the Earth. Okay and then once you started throughout this round, you're thinking more it has to do with changing pressure? Okay, and you agree with what... Connor, was it you that was saying that it was the gravity that was causing the change in pressure?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So are you feeling like, are you taking your idea and kinda hooking it together? Or does something else cause a change in pressure?  Okay, alright. That's fine. Where's the mic? Can you pass it up? Here, I'll come get it. Abigail, last theory. Go.\u000a  Well, at first we weren't sure. And we were talking about kind of atoms moving, like molecules and compounds moving away from each other and combining. But then we changed our opinions and think that like the pressure of air and the temperature of the air and the compounds that make up the air, moving and changing, make wind from the combination.\u000a  So you're really mashing it all together. So your theory revolves around molecules moving away from each other. That was the first part. And then, did that end up causing pressures did you say?\u000a  No, like and then the different types of air kinda combined I guess.\u000a  So then molecules move away from each other. When you say different types of air?\u000a  So like warm, hot and pressure.\u000a  And those combine?\u000a  \u000a  Should I add that to this?\u000a  I don't know.\u000a  Tom. Yeah, Tom.\u000a  I have a question. How would two air masses meet if they didn't have wind to bring them?\u000a  Well, now that's an interesting question. Do air masses, now that's a really interesting question. Are air masses just these big masses of air? And then wind blows them around?\u000a  Because then it wouldn't make the wind if it couldn't, if it couldn't come together, it couldn't make wind.\u000a  Oh, now that's a really interesting thing. So is the wind? Oh, wow. Is wind a result of the air masses? Or do air masses need wind to move? Well, that's a really good question. Ben, you had a hand up.\u000a  I just thought about it, and I didn't really want to share the question. I just was thinking in my head and I thought through the question.\u000a  Alright. Does anybody have any other theories they'd like to suggest? Other than are there. Let's go through them real quick. So we had the theory that said it's hot air rising cool air falling, and somehow those two mixing that creates the wind. We had the theory that said it's the pressure of air and that pressure is kind of dictated by gravity. We had something with currents. So it's somehow the currents in the air, whatever those happen to be, that's what's causing the air to move as wind. There's air masses meeting. If it's the same, what Dave was saying. If the same air mass meeting, that's what causes the wind. It's gravity in the movement of the Earth, which Richard and this table suggested. Although they moved away from it, I think it's a valid theory to be suggested. And then it's molecules moving away from each other and then somehow combining with the other things. So would you take a moment, and if you had to commit to one of these as being why you thought wind would blow, take a moment and talk to each other and decide which one you think you'd commit to as far as which one you think it is. Talk to each other. \u000a I don't really know like what Matthew brought up, how they would move... So...  \u000a  Alright guys, here we go. Would you grab the voter that is registered to you. And when you turn it on, you should have an A through F option. And would you choose one of those to be your theory please?\u000a  Is this graded?\u000a  No, it's not. No, we're just theorizing right now. So just go with the one that feels best to you.\u000a  What's the question?\u000a  It is which one of those theories do you think it is that is what makes wind blow?  Wait for a few more people to vote. Oh Mark, we gotta get to voting. Patrick, you in? Yep, you're in. Okay. Mark, what you want to vote on is which one of these theories you think is best. Votes are on your voter and fire away. And he's the last one to vote, as soon as he goes we'll see what way we as a class think. Oh, you got it? Okay, here we go. Let's see what you think. Alright, so B is our best theory so far. So right now as a group, let me save this. So right now as a group, we are thinking that it is pressure and... Let me ask you this. Let me get a quick hand vote for this, just out of curiosity. One of the things was that the pressure is caused by gravity. How many of you are going to add pressure would be caused by gravity then? Okay, most of the people voted that way look like they're going--\u000a

V It's similar to when we had the hand warmer. What happens is when you add heat energy to the hand warmer, it makes the water rise up. So, in the glass, in the two liter bottle in the glass too, the heat lamp added heat to it, the heat energy. Then the water started to rise up.\u000a Of the water, okay. So, why do you think the water spilled over last time?\u000a I think that it's because of the molecules expanding.\u000a  Okay.\u000a And then the molecules didn't have enough room. Well, the water didn't have enough room, so it had to get out. So, then it popped out through the tube.\u000a  Okay. Do you share the same idea?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Do you agree with her?\u000a Yes.\u000a  Okay. Alright. Let's talk about this. Yes.\u000a I have something. Like, with mine, we thought that since there was oxygen, I mean, there was a glass tube, that the water had room to expand and like, spill out. So, what's why it did.\u000a Okay, thank you. Alright. Let me ask you something. How many of you put that water molecules expanded? Raise your hand. As a reason for water spilling. Alright. Okay. They gave you the reason why, right? So, who can tell me why you put that? Alright, Rebecca.\u000a I put that because, well you see it... Well, in the bottle lab, we had water in there, so when it heated up, they expanded, and they didn't have enough room, so they had to, it had to come out.\u000a  So, molecules got bigger right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a If you don't believe molecules got bigger, what did you guys think that the water spilled over? Yeah.\u000a I think if the water molecules didn't get bigger, I think that the heat caused them to move around and bump into each other.\u000a Okay, so what is the evidence for both of these? You played with the water heater. Where is the evidence to support this? Anybody? Anthony.\u000a Like what I think is that, that the steam is like mostly involved with this, 'cause the only type of air water has is steam. And like, since the water was heated so intensely, it had to let out all the air it contained. So, it spewed out steam.\u000a Okay, thank you very much. Good job. I'm gonna go over with Moorea. Why do you think that water... You didn't agree with water molecule being, expanding, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  So, what is your evidence that it is not expanding?\u000a Well, I think when we added the heat to the water, I think the molecules started getting hotter, and the heat was transferred from the lamp to the molecules, and they started moving around more. Kind of like how sugar makes people, like have a sugar rush, and kind of move around more, and get more excited.. And then, they just needed more room, so they spilled out into the tube.\u000a Okay. Now let me ask you something. If that is true, how come if I press it here, it's going down? Why? Yes, Tyshon.\u000a Because of the heat in your hand.\u000a What's happening, the heat of my hand? Right, Saron.\u000a So, it goes down faster because the heat in your hand is enclosing around the top, I guess. So, it will make it come down.\u000a  Jake.\u000a I'm not sure, but I think it goes down faster, yes, because of everybody else saying that when you hold, from the heat of your hand. But I think it's also because gravity pushes things down.\u000a Okay. Alright. Alec has two finger, means he has something to add.\u000a I agree with Jake. And I also think that since the water went down, it's because it had more room at the bottom. So, when you put your hand around it, it immediately goes down, also because of gravity, and how it has more room.\u000a  How did you come up with that answer?\u000a Well, when you were holding the top, I saw that the bottom was empty. And like, so I thought that 'cause of gravity, when you hold it at the top, it has more room to go down--\u000a  But if you hold the bottom. Look at the whole bottom. Hold the bottom. What's happening?\u000a It's right there.\u000a  It's against the gravity. It's going up. So, hold on. I'm gonna provide the evidence about the result. This is computer simulation. Watch this carefully. I want you to watch this carefully. And look at this. The right side is water. Okay, the right side is water. And, did I turn the heat on?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Yeah. Okay. So, who turned it off? I'm gonna reset it. Okay. And then, heat is off. Watch. Look at air and water molecule. Let's look at the water molecules first, since we're doing the liquid part. Are you with me?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Alright. What is happening to water molecule? Write it down with your group. You've got 30 seconds.  Talk to the group.\u000a Molecules are vibrating very slightly.\u000a Since the water's mostly cooled down, more than the air, it's more stable. It's like, doesn't vibrate as much as air, 'cause water is like, more still, and more like a solid than air.\u000a Okay. Please observe everything. And I'm going to be asking you questions. Alright. And here we go. I'm gonna turn the heat on. As a group, you need do discuss and write everything down, what you see here. Just the air. I mean, I'm sorry. Just observe the water, yes. Everything, okay. Here we go. Group. Water only.  Okay, now discuss with your group. Alright. Water only. \u000a The water molecules, they aren't moving around like the air ones, but they're vibrating. They're moving like back and forth. They're vibrating like really violently. They're staying in the same general area. Like . But the water ones are like... I'm sorry, the molecules in the air are bouncing around, and when the heat is applied, they start bouncing around faster.\u000a I agree with Maor, but I think that with the air ones, that they have more room to bounce around. That the water is all contained in one thing. So, the molecules have to stay in one position, but the air has to--\u000a What do you think, ladies? You haven't said anything.\u000a I think the same thing as Maor, because the air molecules have more room to the surrounding, because it's really nothing in there. And since water is a liquid it has less room. Whatever.\u000a I see that, the more the heat gets on the water--\u000a Alright, 30 more seconds. So, we're gonna start the discussion. There are people who need more time to write, but you already know what to do. So, here we are. Okay. I'm gonna call on individuals, so, please do so. You don't have to stand up. Ivree.\u000a I saw that when you turned on the lamp, it started vibrating faster than--\u000a  Which one? We're talking about which one?\u000a The water.\u000a  Okay. Vibrating faster. Joon Po, you think through?\u000a The temperature also started rising very little.\u000a  Excellent. Dylan, what else did you notice?\u000a I'm noticing that when the heat is on, the water is starting to vibrate very fast when it's turned on, but they are staying stationary, they're not actually moving anymore.\u000a  So, why do you think the water molecules are vibrating? Chelsea.\u000a Because of the heat that is going on to the molecules.\u000a  So, what you're saying is the heat source is going to molecules. Class. What do you call the heat source? Which is the lamp. What is it?\u000a Heat energy.\u000a  Heat energy. Very good. So, in this case. I don't know if you agree with Chelsea. Raise your hand. How many of you disagree? Raise your hand. Alright. How many of you agree with Chelsea? Raise your hand. Okay. Alright. The molecules are transferring energy. The heat energy is transferring heat to the energy. Thank you very much. Now, next part, I'm going to give you a life problem to solve. And I want you to come up with solutions. Okay. How many like to play ping pong? Oh, excellent. You know, I grew up playing ping pong, because in Asian culture, ping pong's a lot cheaper to purchase than basketballs. So, most every home has ping pong, or ping pong table, because it's easy to make out of wood. Now, having said that. Suppose you received a set of ping pong balls for holiday because you asked for it, from your parents, and your parents being really nice, and you behaved really well. They decide to give you these ping pong balls you got. The problem is you lost all of them except one. And your best friend came over to play with this. But he stepped on it on accident. So, now here's a dent. Right, he has to fix it. Can you fix it? You're all worried. Because you've never seen anybody can fix this. So, give me some suggestions by talking to your group. Alright. You have buddies back up there, alright. \u000a Kind of like the water bottle, right. Especially like, you can fix another part. Maybe you could do the same thing with the ping pong ball.\u000a Like if you start to squish the ping pong balls down, and maybe you could  its place.\u000a It'd be easier to pop it out.\u000a I think you can apply air. You can apply air like with heat. Like at least heat. 'Cause you know when the heat was added to the water? Right. Like you could apply air with a little...\u000a Do you need more time?\u000a Like the thing--\u000a Okay. So, I'm going to write the solution, alright, by asking group that has an answer. Just stand up one at a time, the group that hasn't answered yet. Alright. So here's a solution. Say ping pong ball dilemma. Alright. Okay, number one. Which group is gonna be? Just stand up. Just stand up, if you haven't spoke in this group.\u000a We already thought that you could try and use your hands and  like pop the air back into it and get it to its original shape.\u000a Okay. Alright, number two. Something different. Which group that hasn't spoken yet? Okay, Chelsea's group.\u000a Alec said that if you push around the edges, it might pop back into shape.\u000a  So, kind of the same thing. Yes.\u000a We think that somehow if you maybe poked a hole in it, you can use, like an air pump, or some sort of machine to get the air in it, and maybe the air will push against the dent. And make it a sphere again.\u000a  Let's see how many of you believe this dilemma, raise your hand. Okay. Alright. How many of you believe this is gonna work? Raise your hand. How many believe this is gonna work? Alright. Is there a third option, anybody? Okay. Yes.\u000a I don't know if this will work, but maybe you can put in front of a lamp.\u000a Okay. Excellent start. But why would you put it in front a lamp? Let me ask you something.\u000a Maybe so that the molecules in it, like in the water example, maybe they'll start, like vibrate...\u000a  No, you're okay.\u000a Well, it's air, so--\u000a  You want to add heat energy, right?\u000a Yeah, you want to add heat.\u000a  Alright, so, we're gonna try all of those. So, let's try with number one. So, I'm going to give Sasha a ping pong ball that's been dented by my best friend. Or not my best friend. Her best friend, so she's gonna try to do it. Okay, number two is what? Pop a hole in it. So, how many of you disagree with this? Or of this idea. Why would you disagree with this idea, Dylan?\u000a Because if you poked a hole in it, it would be kind of like, ruin it, and release all this stuff, and it would be kind of hard to--\u000a  Okay. What are you ruining in this case?\u000a The ping pong ball.\u000a  In other words. What you're saying, is a surface of the thing?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay. Did you try?\u000a Yeah, like it's really hard. So, it's actually hard to pop it back in.\u000a  Let's see. Who's strong?\u000a Me.\u000a Okay. You're strong. She wants to do it. If she doesn't work, then let's do it. Okay, how about the lamp? Lamp thingy. So... Let's see. Are you the one that says the... Come on over. Okay. Leave it like this. Turn the heater on. Okay. On the top, yeah, that's it. The other way. There you go. Right there. Yeah, there, you got it.\u000a  Oh, okay.\u000a Oh, what happened? It helps if it's connected isn't it?  Okay. Try that again. There. So, we're gonna time it. While we're working on this for a couple minutes. Okay. Alright. Okay. Alright. So, who has the ping pong now? \u000a The dent was too strong.\u000a Okay, now. Look at the ping pong ball. I'm gonna show it to you. Okay, look. You saw it right? All of you. What happened?\u000a It has more dents.\u000a Not only the dent. What else?\u000a It broke.\u000a Is this gonna work? That's completely ruined... What did that do? Nothing. Alright, so, let's say first idea is no good. Okay. So, second idea, poke a hole. We agreed that it's not gonna work, because it's gonna compromise. How many of you agree with that? It's gonna compromise the shape of the thing. Okay. Alright, the third idea. Alright. It's about a minute. Nothing's happening. Okay. Do you have any other suggestions? Who hasn't said anything? Sydney?\u000a I think maybe you could like put it between your hands, because it might work the same as the lamp, but just faster.\u000a Okay. So, how many agree that, looks like both of you, if I'm not mistaken, that you have to have some kind of heat, right? You said because?\u000a I said because, like the water, it needs room to expand. Well, it's not actually expanding, but it needs room to move, so, the ball will probably expand.\u000a Okay, I'm gonna show you this simulation. Is there something... Yes, Dylan.\u000a Yeah, I want to add... Maybe it would work better under a stronger heat source.\u000a  Okay, like a sun.\u000a Yeah, like--\u000a Okay. Can I tell you something that I did before the class? I put it under the lighter and the ping pong went like pshhh. You know, to be honest with you, the ash was big as this one. That was it. I was looking for ping pong ball. It'll burn. Alright, now, I want to show you this simulation again. Okay. So, bear with me here. You all said the two things I'm gonna talk about. You all said the molecules were expanding, meaning molecules are getting bigger, right? Tell me. Is this molecule getting bigger?\u000a  No.\u000a Okay, so molecules are not getting bigger. How many of you believe it's not getting bigger? Remember, simulation is evidence. Is that what is happening? Like many of you said already. Jake.\u000a They're moving around really fast in the space. For air and water, they're vibrating.\u000a So, look at the air this time. Alright. The air. So, class, which one would you say is moving faster?\u000a  Air.\u000a Okay. So, air is moving faster. Okay, we're gonna discuss this next step. So, everyone's gonna get a big picture. You have a question, I need to see the finger thing. Yes.\u000a I have a, I guess, reason... Well, I have another thing that I noticed about that I guess, you could say. I think that the reason why the water molecules are moving slower is because the water is taking up space, and they can't travel around that fast because in the air, there's really nothing in there that's stopping them from moving. But I guess, you can compare it to us when we're swimming under water. We move slower than we normally do on land. Yeah.\u000a  So, air molecules are moving really fast, right? So, what's happening as it's moving very fast? Sydney, you have something to add? Okay.\u000a I was just gonna say, if you look at water, it sort of looks like it's in an invisible cage. And it's trying to move around, but it can't.\u000a  So, it's restricted. It doesn't move as well.\u000a

V  Isn't it nuclear fission when, like, fusion? No, fusion is when they combine. Nuclear fission is like when they split apart, right?\u000a Yes, so it's a fission process.\u000a  See? Ah!\u000a So that's a , I see that, that efficient.\u000a  Efficient.\u000a It increases the safety though, right?\u000a  It's impossible to explain.\u000a No, I'm just saying, does it?\u000a  No, I don't understand. Am I the only one here?\u000a Apparently to you, though. \u000a So, why is it that when the atom is unstable it's radioactive?\u000a It could be it's removing protons and neutrons?\u000a I think you guys can discuss this.\u000a  Isn't it when like it starts releasing the neutrons to a different atom, or something, and then it gains the neutron, and that's when it starts becoming, like--\u000a More vulnerable--\u000a  More vulnerable, and it starts, like, a chain reaction.\u000a  You guys agree?\u000a I agree.\u000a  I agree.\u000a  I agree with everybody.\u000a That's right. \u000a  So, how can radiation help them? Like Amy said--\u000a It could also help in the electricity and helps us get our resources.\u000a Like you said. \u000a  What else though?\u000a Like cancer.\u000a  Cancer?\u000a  Cancer.\u000a I mean, I had an aunt that suffered from cancer and it kind of helped her even though she passed away. It kept her longer than it would have been without her having medication.\u000a Any last thoughts? Okay, that's fine, thank you. I have only one major, I guess comment, about that one. I noticed Steve used a lot of vocabulary words. He did remember a lot of the words, and I think he planned for that. And then I liked the way that David actually redirected the group. He asked the group, "How can radiation help us?" right at the end, and then people responded to that. So, he kind of helped redirect the questions for the discussion group. So, and then people were able to respond. So, that was a nice way to create a discussion. Okay, question number two.\u000a  Three.\u000a  Three.\u000a I'm sorry. Okay, I mean...\u000a How about number four next?\u000a  Okay, I'm going to do number four next.\u000a No!\u000a Do number three. The one with three.\u000a No, I'm going to do four.\u000a No, I want to do three. Okay, number four is going to go next. You have two minutes to prepare.  Number four.  Just ignore it.\u000a What is that?\u000a  A microphone.\u000a Oh, it works? So, they can hear me right now? Oh. \u000a It's recording?\u000a  Well, why do you think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the USA and what are some arguments for nuclear energy?\u000a  David, put that away. \u000a  Okay, Jane, who's going to go next?\u000a  Me.\u000a Jane.\u000a  Okay, so which vocabulary and evidence are you going to focus on?\u000a  Nuclear power plant, nuclear power plant--\u000a  Well, pick several.\u000a  The nuclear, yeah. The nuclear power plant can help us create more energy. I mean, well it's--\u000a Nuclear radiation, for my argument.\u000a  You know what Dano was saying?\u000a No.\u000a  He was just going to put power plants.\u000a Do you know what it is?\u000a Yeah, it's where they . Yeah.\u000a  Okay, what does it do?\u000a Creates energy.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Okay, what other evidence are you going to use, though?\u000a The fact that we are running out of, well, we're not running out of, but, in the future we might not be able to find enough energy . So, we need to start. We need to start thinking about the future, like--\u000a Jobs and stuff.\u000a No, future things that are like, the future and what's going to happen and energy and how are we going to have a good supply. Like what if we were running out and start thinking about that?\u000a Okay, so the next person.  Okay, so the people on the outside, if you were recording the vocabulary last time, I want the people on the outside to switch so that you're recording something different. So if you did evidence first, switch to vocabulary. If you did vocabulary, switch to evidence.\u000a Oh, Sindi, sit like right here. \u000a Okay, this question is why do you think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the U.S., and based on the video we watched, what are some arguments to be made for nuclear energy?\u000a I think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the U.S. because it doesn't release chemicals, therefore it's eco-friendly, making the U.S. more green. Environmentally, green.\u000a I agree with her, because another reason I think the president might support it is because, like, like right now we're in an economic crisis, what you call the thing? And then like making new plants may create more jobs for people. It'll create jobs for building them, and then it'll also benefit everybody for clean power.\u000a  I agree. \u000a I agree because it builds economic stabilization, and it'll create jobs for the future, like, for more years, because in order to run a nuclear power plant you need, you know, like, to build it. And once it's built, you still need to work with it so I think the job's going to last for a while.\u000a I agree.\u000a  But if we're in an economic crisis, like if we're in an economic crisis how are you going to pay for it? Like, where's the money going to come from?\u000a Well, we're already in debt, so we'll get even more debt.\u000a  Yeah, it costs a lot to build a nuclear reactor.\u000a We'd get funding.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a And we have to, like, think about the future and how it's going to benefit, you know, for the economy and making more power plants would just provide, like, a stable future for the upcoming people and the jobs because it supplies more jobs and stuff.\u000a  And more, you know, we'll get more electricity. You know, if we build more nuclear power plants.\u000a Yeah, and not just 20%, but more like the other countries who have 30 and stuff like that--\u000a  needs luxuries, rising electricity demands. It won't leave the U.S. behind and all the new tech stuff? \u000a  And the more factories, and the more power plants we produce, we make, the more electricity and the more factories, it will get more stuff. It will build the more jobs, and that will raise up the economic problems.\u000a Yeah, because more stuff will be done that way.\u000a So, now you guys have given a lot of arguments supporting nuclear energy. What do you think is the biggest problem with nuclear energy that we should be aware of?\u000a The thing that causes cancer.\u000a Probably be the radioactive waste that the nuclear power plants give off. Well, they don't give it off, the water, the coolant or whatever. And then, like, they don't have nowhere to store it. I think it was some cave thingy that they were trying to build, but they didn't build.\u000a  They're going to run out of space to put the waste in. \u000a  Also, it's going to cause cancer to everyone.\u000a But doesn't it cure cancer and stuff?\u000a It has benefits, but more like some freak accident can happen, like what happened in Fukushima.\u000a Or the third mile.\u000a At the Three Mile?\u000a Yeah. \u000a So, say you never know what can happen, that's the downside. Because if it does happen, then it's like downhill from there because people start getting sick, then their kids start dying, and I don't know.\u000a Yeah, and like Giovanni said, if we are in an economic crisis, like where are we going to get the rest of the money? We're just going to get it from debt and stuff like that. We're going to help raise it up, but we'll also fall more in debt.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Going back to the nuclear waste, can someone elaborate on why is the nuclear waste such a problem?\u000a Because it's just there--\u000a Kevin?\u000a  I think nuclear waste will cause more wars and pollution. That's what I think.\u000a  Cause more what?\u000a  It causes more war and pollution.\u000a  War?\u000a  Well, I mean.  This isn't on camera, right? \u000a Okay, someone else?\u000a Wait, what was the question again?\u000a Elaborate on what is nuclear waste?\u000a Nuclear waste?\u000a Why is that such a problem for us?\u000a Well, it's a problem because there's nowhere where you could actually safely put it. Other than like, I think they have this, I read something about they have an island where all the waste of nuclear waste goes. That's the only place that you can, like, get rid of it. Don't throw it in the ocean because it'll contaminate everything. You can't just, like, leave it in the ground because then it'll probably like leak.\u000a And also, doesn't it, if it rains, if water gets in it, it's dangerous? So, that's why they have to find a place where it's not like--\u000a Why is it dangerous if water gets into it? \u000a Soil, I guess?\u000a  The waste and the water mix and then, like, it runs down into the soil and it might go into the ocean or the sewers and it'll mess up the ocean, or, like, water--\u000a And we end up drinking it.\u000a  And scientists are trying to find ways to get rid of the waste, like they're thinking of shooting it out into space or anything. \u000a One thing nobody talked about was half-life. What does the half-life have to do with nuclear waste?\u000a I think a bunch of years.\u000a  What does it have to do with Obama? \u000a Say it louder.\u000a What?\u000a Say it louder.\u000a We're talking about that noise. \u000a Wait, what was your question?\u000a What does half-life have to do with nuclear waste?\u000a Half-life, nuclear waste.\u000a So, energy?\u000a So, why is nuclear waste bad exactly?\u000a Oh, because they haven't determined the amount of years of when the half-life is. I think they determined like So they, so it was an estimate. It wasn't actually a fact, they just estimated that, so it could be before, so they wouldn't be able to prevent, to prevent it from affecting society.\u000a Oh, good. So, let's just get this done. Let's try the next group, okay? Thank you. \u000a I know, Bryan.\u000a I don't need to look it up. I know this already.\u000a Okay. Do you guys want to break before you go up? Okay, you guys get one or two minutes to prep yourself.  So it's not a shock  Okay, question number three, let's come up. People seem anxious, let's do this.  Okay, no phone Diana. \u000a We're missing people.\u000a Yeah, we are. Okay, so people on the outside, you guys should switch. So, if you did evidence, you know. So, what you did one time evidence, looking for evidence, and one time you're looking for vocabulary. Okay? So, people on the outside make sure you're checking different parts. Okay, so what, I might change the question, you guys.\u000a What?\u000a It happens. Okay, number three. What recommendations would you make to President Obama regarding clean energy and climate change? So, for example, they're trying to build two nuclear power plants in Georgia. So, what recommendations will you make to him about building in Georgia?\u000a Building in jorj-ee-uh?\u000a Georgia, the state.\u000a Um, I think he should make sure that employees aren't making careless mistakes such as the human error in the Three Mile Island.\u000a  I think that he should promote programs on alternative energy, but not just nuclear energy. But he could also use nuclear energy because it could, because the field cost and operating cost is low and 20% of our energy already comes from nuclear energy. So, we could just get more energy through nuclear power.\u000a  I think we shouldn't use it because of, it causes harm to people and you never know when an accident happens, and it might hurt the environment and it leads to cancer.\u000a Okay, nuclear energy affects public safety and it creates, nuclear power plants create toxic waste.\u000a  I would still try to build a nuclear power plant because it could also boost our economy when it's most struggling.\u000a  Recommendations I would make to Obama regarding nuclear energy is that, to stop because it's too dangerous to handle, and that if it gets in the hands of terrorists, they can use it to murder, to murder me or destroy countries. We can't prevent natural disasters from destroying nuclear power plants, then the nuclear radiation, which is unstable, can harm by radioactivity, and a nuclear spill has happened in the past with human error that hit Fukushima. And this means that it can happen to anyone, even us. That's what I wrote.\u000a I think it could be a good idea, but I think they should focus more on how it could harm people, to try and control the harmfulness so it won't harm people. Yeah, I think it's a good idea.\u000a I think my recommendation for Obama is that it is not good to  nuclear because it's going to affect us, it's going to affect our pollution. And he's going to spend like more energy on that and he can save more money if he didn't do that.\u000a Yeah, I agree with Charlie, too. We don't know what nuclear energy could also, like, harm us, which ways. Or, I mean we do, but I mean, it's better. Like we could just focus on studying more, like, having more thoughts. Like, ask him what's better? It's like to choose nuclear plants or to keep using what we're using now.\u000a So, I have to change one question. Based on all the videos and the articles you guys saw and read, what argument has influenced you the most?\u000a  The Fukushima argument.\u000a So, go ahead and explain it to the group, though.\u000a Because, um, things happen and they just prove to us that they can also happen to us, like human error. And I think they made people evacuate the cities and the damage, the area which is, nobody can go because it's radioactive, and they have to wait for the atoms to decay which is like, I don't know, thousands of years just for the half-life, and we won't be able to use that space anymore. It kills everything. People got cancer.\u000a

V Counting on that. I agree with AJ, but also I think that... What I want to say is that it kind of adds a lot more risk when they get rid of the space shuttle because kind of like what AJ was saying, it's good to have a backup just in case you want it. And we still do need to go up to space every now and again if we want to maintain stuff up there. So we know that, so we're having other people work with it, but the problem is, is that actually adds more risk because now we have to deal with the fact that, "What if they messed up? "What if they blow up "or do something wrong?" And if they're not as stringent on safety standards as we are then there's gonna be a lot more problems and if it's not able to do the same things that's going to be completely bad, too.\u000a Okay, Eric said, "Go up to fix things." What would be some things that we would need to make sure that we're going up to maintain in space? Just to kind of follow up.\u000a  International Space Station.\u000a Okay, International Space Station.\u000a Some of the satellites we have in orbit.\u000a Okay, satellites that do what for us?\u000a Television and communication.\u000a Okay.\u000a Ms. McCall, what's that one with the sun that is predicting the sun flares?\u000a  You can just write Sun Probe.\u000a Sun probe.\u000a  That's fine. Excuse me while I turn this on.\u000a  And the Hubble.\u000a Hubble's gone a lot longer than they expected it to, so if it breaks, we'd want to repair it.\u000a Especially since we don't have a new one.\u000a Alana.\u000a I know how Mer was talking about the risks, like with the Challenger and that was really devastating, but I remember the wife whose husband died on Challenger. She said that he knew the risks. That's part of being an astronaut and being in NASA and willing to go up there and you're risking your life. It's not like they went in there totally blind about that. I think that's kind of the price of gaining so much knowledge about something so unknown right now. We have to be able to risk our lives to get it and if they have people willing to do that, I say go for it.\u000a  Okay, Blanca and then Megan.\u000a I get what she's saying with they risked their lives, but you're also risking... the money and time that everyone has put into it. They spent all this time and all this money on these ginormous space things and to put them up into space. And like the Challenger it just exploded and they didn't even really get that far just for one minor error. And I don't think they should cut all the way like they were saying. Have it just when you need it, but it's still a lot of money that our country doesn't really have right now, so maybe it's not the most important thing and there's other things that they need to fix before they can go back to putting more money into that.\u000a  We'll go Megan, then Bieber.\u000a So, you know how we're paying Russia to fly up to the International Space Station? I think what we should do is have a shuttle and have people pay us to ride up to the space station. Because then we have more funding for NASA and then we have a shuttle. Then people know they can get us instead of giving all this money to Russia to fly up there. I feel like we should still have our own shuttle so that we can fly up, not for free, but we can fly up with the United States and then have open seats for other countries who need to come in. They can pay us for it and then we get the money.\u000a  Okay, Bieber, you need to sit close. Eli, then we'll go Rachel.\u000a I don't know what color to show, but Russia's not making a profit off of us riding up there. They're just trying to cover their costs. It's not like we'll be doing good business ferrying people to the International Space Station. It's not like a tourist attraction or anything. It's pretty bland up there. Russia's just trying to pay to get us up there. That's the cost of flying somebody there. They're not making profit out of it.\u000a  Okay, good, that's a downpoint. Rachel?\u000a  I agree with what Eli said and also, people were talking earlier about... jobs and how it creates a bunch of jobs. And I think I read somewhere that they created 25,000 jobs or something like that. But if you think about it, if there's 300 million people, that's still less than 1% of the population. So, while it seems like a big number, it's still not creating as many jobs and we could be creating other jobs somewhere else. Especially with the economy, so we could be spending the money that we would be spending on NASA on something else to help boost our economy before we start focusing more on NASA and spending billions of dollars.\u000a  Amber, then Clark.\u000a I was going to say I kind of agree with that because our economy is so bad right now. Any kind of job that is offered will be really good for us right now, at this point in time. So, I don't think cutting the funding for it would be a really smart idea because that's also putting a lot of people out of work.\u000a  Clark.\u000a The statistics with the jobs created are probably from when NASA was being used a lot and now that it's been cut down already all those jobs have already been cut. And I don't think in this economy, people need jobs requiring that much education... not everybody has that kind of education to have a job like that. People just need regular jobs in general.\u000a So, you're saying their employment would be kind of geared towards upper level educated as opposed to maybe...\u000a And like in science and stuff and not everybody has that.\u000a That's a downpoint. Luis.\u000a Going back to the billions of dollars that are wasted or could be used for better things, I found out that the funding for NASA only accounts for 0.7% of the US government spending. I feel like if you just cut all of that, that's not really going to make a huge difference when the government's spending 99.3% on other things.\u000a  We'll go Hallie, then Troy.\u000a Going back to the risk of sending people out into space, I researched and... I found out that the risk of manned space flights are actually increasing because the budget cuts have already happened. As we're pushing for more people and more money, we're actually hurting ourselves more because the safety and quality assurance programs have been trimmed back. The risk is just becoming more and more.\u000a That's an interesting point. As we're slowly cutting back on the budgets already, we're automatically increasing that risk because of those budget cuts. Troy?\u000a I actually support... them cutting the budget because... for one, when they cut budget, they're setting aside money to... buy more space exploration from private companies. Those people are more likely to employ more employees than the government, which also stimulates the economy a lot more. I mean, if everybody's employed by the government, like what could happen to Greece.\u000a Okay, Shannon hasn't spoken, Bieber.\u000a Kind of off of what Holly said with the risk and everything going up, I did a little research and with NASA, there was only a 4.1% fatality rate. Out of something like 439 astronauts, there have only been 18 deaths. I feel like there are other jobs with a higher fatality rate than being an astronaut.\u000a Okay, so even with the budget cuts, we're not seeing this huge increase... Jillian.\u000a A lot of people are making the points that it's only affecting the people that are on the space shuttles, but at the same time, I don't think people realize the amount of carbon dioxide... put off by one shuttle launch. It's 28 tons of carbon dioxide and it's killing... the plants and fish around the site area and it has a lot of negative effect on everyone, not just the people in the space shuttle.\u000a So, you're taking the environmental aspect. Besides looking at costs, besides looking at jobs, there's this environmental piece specifically with carbon dioxide. What is the issue associated with carbon dioxide, Jillian?\u000a The ozone layer depleted... and global warming.\u000a Thank you, global warming. Tyler?\u000a To go along with what Luis said, they only get 0.7% of the national spending, but we also have gained more knowledge from NASA than any other government thing. We can discover maybe how Earth is going to end, and we can discover things that are more important than other government, government spending.\u000a So, you're kind of going at the idea that the benefits are outweighing the small amount of cost when we compare government spending. We'll go Eli, then Justin.\u000a Also, Luis said it doesn't account for very much of the US budget and if we cut that spending, it's really not going to go to anything more productive. Maybe more guns or something. It's not going to feed the world and buy food for homeless people. It's just going to go to corporations and wars. And then in regards to CO2 emissions... does anyone know how much CO2 emissions a moose puts out in a year? Far more than a truck driver. Cows and moose. I think they can flirt over that. I think that's just moose. \u000a So, you're making the comparison to say the idea that even though it's a human-made craft, if we look at natural sources of the CO2 emission...\u000a And the relative frequency that a moose passes gas. A space shuttle launch doesn't have that big of an effect on the environment.\u000a Touche. Anyone have a cup that hasn't spoken yet, that wants to jump in real quick? Justin.\u000a Going off of what Tyler said, if we stop funding NASA, then we pretty much cut off studying anything outside of our solar system because of the atmosphere of Earth just doesn't allow us to see that far. So, it would lessen the chances of seeing the birth of a star or the death of a star or where earth might be heading in the future.\u000a Interesting point. Amber, then Eric.\u000a Besides everything about the jobs, NASA has created a lot of things that have helped us today, different technologies. Like in someone's presentation, they were saying something about they're creating lighter systems for firefighters, and then cosmetic companies are even using their stuff. So, there's a lot of technology that's been created because of NASA, so I think it's benefited us a lot more than it hasn't helped us.\u000a And so, you're saying those products that have been produced because of the exploration are useful to us in our everyday lives. It's not just useful for exploring many new things. I forgot my order. Was it Eric on that one?\u000a I have a couple different connections. One of them's with the cost. Like they're saying, it's 0.7% of the total budget, but the thing is, not only is it that low of a cost, it's 14 billion, just to give you an actual number. It's 14 billion dollars for the entire budget of NASA. This year, just for this year alone. To give you a comparison, it's around $640 between $680 for the military budget. That is 47 times more expensive. Now you can say, "Well, alright, that's the military." The thing is that first of all, it has a lot higher mortality rate. Second of all, it's... a lot less productive in general. I mean, we're pretty much paying people to kill other people on the planet. I'm sorry, but that's not very cool in general. For one of those things, we're trying to get a high fatality rate, not for our side but the other side. But the other thing is that for jobs creations, if you want to create more jobs and you're going for a more positive feel, you wouldn't decrease funding for NASA, you would increase funding. Because, think about it. If you increased it 47 times to the military, I'm pretty sure you'd get a lot more than one million even a lot, lot more than just one million jobs from NASA, if you increased this funding a lot, because imagine whole new planets. Just for environment alone is the fact that we have seven billion people on this planet, and with seven billion people, we can't hold that many people very long on this planet. But there are so many other planets out there, that we could easily fit everyone. There's enough planets in this entire galaxy for each person to have their own planet. That's how many planets there are.\u000a So, you're thinking planning for the future, that it might be beneficial for us. Holly.\u000a As I was researching, I found out that there's really no short-term benefits and we're not guaranteed long-term benefits. Yes, we are learning about things outside of our solar system and universe, but the main goal of studying outside the universe is so eventually it could help us. We're not guaranteed to find some new way to cure cancer or to protect the earth from... magnetic storms. There might be some way we can save ourselves, but we're not guaranteed that.\u000a So, you're saying the unknown part of that research kind of plays into  the factor. We can keep researching, but we may never find the answer. Monique, you got some info?\u000a Yeah, I think when Hepetiah said how benefits outweigh the budget and the risks, we've talked about what was up there. The benefits are so much longer than what we have in the risk section. We gain knowledge, we need to study, the sun probe and Hubble and International Space Station. With jobs, it provides a whole section of jobs, having shuttles go up to space. Not only that, but they've created new inventions through that, and I think the inventions they have created is really important at home and in the hospital. Going from there, there's going to be more. Not just stopping now.\u000a So again, tying in the cost-benefit analysis, that the benefits are much more outweighing the costs. A.J. and then we'll go Alana.\u000a I guess to counter what Troy said and what a few people have said, when they talk about that more jobs can be created using the money. It's not just about the economy. When you think about it, NASA wasn't meant to help the economy at all, and it wasn't meant for job creation, even though it has employed so many people. Through the research that I did, there was a story from somebody that's going to be retiring just because he knows he'd lose his job anyway. He said that, "After 30 years, this is all I know." We're losing the most brilliant minds our country has, because they just don't know what else to do. NASA's been open for decades and that's their job. Technicians and analysts, they're not going to just become accountants or something. There's nothing after NASA. That's probably the highest, most prestigious thing. What do you do after that? It's not like they're just going to fill minimum wage jobs, which is what most people are looking for right now, anyway, if you're thinking about job creation.\u000a It's a good point, you have all these highly educated, specialized people as A.J. points out. Where are they going to go? Are they going to be able to find jobs within our country? Are they going to go overseas and then maybe be helpful and more productive for other countries? It's a good point. Alana, then Troy.\u000a I know we're talking a lot about the cost-benefit and job creation, but I want to go back to the safety, and I have a question for everyone just to think about. The main part in all the failed missions, especially with the shuttle and the Challenger, it's basically been human error. You know they talk about how the higher guys wouldn't listen, that it was too cold outside and the ring would break and  everything, but I've been thinking: what if we were to use some sort of higher technology instead of relying on human    and the possible errors that we make. Like robots, we use robots to build half our cars, and that probably cuts down a lot on the human error rate. So, do you think using more robotic and higher technology than just humans, would that help in any way with the safety issue and the errors that we make?\u000a  That's an interesting point. We'll have to put that on the question board. Troy, what you got?\u000a Kind of to counter what A.J. said, these people are highly educated. Minimum wage places are probably the ones that are hiring the least. Companies with a lot of money are the ones that are hiring them now. People that have... highly specialized degrees, they're really intelligent and they could be working at places like in finance. Those people are being hired a lot more than people that have financial degrees. If you can do quantitative physics, those people are going to be hired a lot more than someone who's just a finance agent.\u000a So, your counterpoint is the idea that because they're so highly educated, they will find some sort of a niche.\u000a Yeah. There's a lot of people that actually get degrees in rocket science and end up going into finance because it pays better.\u000a Interesting. Jillian?\u000a Back to what Alana said, if you're using robots to make it safer, that's also just going to cost more money to make those robots and to find people that can make those robots. If you're using robots as the engineers, then you're having people lose jobs.\u000a Interesting point. So, kind of a counterpoint to... shifting our focus from human exploration to robotics, there's some drawback association. We'll go Rachel.\u000a Going back to what Eric said a while ago, he was talking about the military and it has a higher budget, but I feel like the military helps a lot of people, and it creates a lot of jobs and educates people, because the military pays for a lot of people's education, university and stuff. I know a lot of people now, since university is so expensive, a lot of people are going into the military so they can get their education paid for. So, I feel like it should have a higher budget because it's creating so many jobs and especially for people who aren't necessarily... has a doctorate in physics or something. People that are really smart, like what Troy said, they won't really have that much of a problem finding jobs, especially with a big corporation. They don't have to necessarily work for the government or NASA or something. So, I think that the budget should stay where it is, because that's pretty funny.\u000a  We'll go Megan and Tyler.\u000a I don't know when it was mentioned, but we were talking about how we're trying to find how the earth will be when all has failed, and I feel like with all the carbon dioxide emitted and with our atmosphere right now, we're trying to discover what our world will be like when all of that's gone. I feel like that's really important for the development of Earth, is to know what it's going to be like when there is no more. What can we do so that we don't turn into a Mars or Venus? What can we do now to stop it from happening?\u000a Good, so you're making connections to maybe the video when they talked about the future if there's an issue with our magnetosphere. Potentially could we wind up like Mars? So, kind of getting a jumpstart to say where we are headed, future-wise. So, almost like a selfish need to figure out what's going on out there and where we might go. Anyone that hasn't spoken yet want to comment?\u000a

V  Today is Wednesday.\u000a Yes, I would clone myself.\u000a Good, why? Why would you clone yourself?\u000a Because everybody deserves a second me. \u000a So you would just...\u000a And I would clone a woolly mammoth for my clone to ride on.  Honestly...\u000a What would some of the negatives to cloning something like that?\u000a  Well, it's another me . But it's still good, because, you know, I'm me, and I'm good and bad.\u000a Do you know your clone is not going to be, like, set, right? You're gonna have to wait for it to grow up.\u000a So, I have to raise a little baby clone of me? \u000a Yes.\u000a And it'll look just like me when I was a baby?\u000a Pretty much.\u000a Oh, that's wrong!  Oh, my God. There are so many possibilities.\u000a Alright. So, let's start off with...\u000a I'll get it a baby .\u000a Raise your hand if you can remind us, like, what is cloning? There's only one of you?\u000a Like taking the DNA, or, like, I don't know, like, whatever, out of one person, like, trying to, like duplicate it into another one?\u000a Okay,great. We're all... well, was there only, like, one type of cloning? What were some of the different types?\u000a Well, one type of cloning is only tissues and organs only, and another one is, let's see, animal and livestock cloning.\u000a Anything else you want to add to that? Gady? So, what's one way they do the cloning? So, they take the DNA from one animal, what do they do?\u000a  \u000a Do you remember what parts they used? Like what kind of cell they used?\u000a  Nucleus?\u000a They did take the nucleus. And they used?\u000a  \u000a The eggs of the other animal. Okay, it's kind of interesting. You can take the egg from one animal and completely change its DNA. So, now when that turns into a new organism, it's an identical copy of the animal that it came from.\u000a And if you take... you can bring back endangered species, too. Because remember that  or whatever, then they put in the cow?\u000a Yeah.\u000a But they were, like, related in some kind of way, so it wasn't, like, weird.\u000a That's true. It was probably a decendent. Do you guys remember that from the video? They had tried to take an animal that was almost extinct, in fact, they couldn't actually do the tests on the animal. Remember, they were saying that there were so few of them that they couldn't even do the tests on them? Right? How long did  last? Does anyone remember?\u000a  Three days.\u000a Yeah, it was about three days, right. But it was the first time.\u000a So, when they couldn't open up that cow, the cow died, right?\u000a I don't know that for sure, but I'm guessing that they were not that interested in the cow medically. They were...\u000a Oh, no, I was just wondering because there's a cow sitting there with a giant gaping hole in its womb.\u000a That's true. That does happen.\u000a I mean, I don't care if the cow died, honestly. That's another hamburger for me. But that Goward? That Goward? That's swole. You can't get any other animal like that.\u000a Anybody else in here agree that it's okay to do that testing to save endangered species?\u000a Well yeah, because if there's like a hundred million cows and one... whatever that thing was called... \u000a So, we should probably try and get more of them?\u000a Yeah, why not?\u000a Okay.\u000a We should clone pandas.\u000a Let's hear somebody else, though. Is there anybody else that has....\u000a \u000a I said,  alligator.  try and bring it back.\u000a That's true. What happens when there's so many? I mean, how many of you have ever watched the movie Jurassic Park?\u000a Oh, my God, I've seen all of them at least twice.\u000a So, that's a good question. So, if we can bring back something that looks like a cow, fabulous. What happens when you want to bring something that looks just as cool, but has bigger teeth?\u000a Well, you see, it breaks out of the cage, like in Jurassic Park the Lost World, and it starts attacking all the...\u000a Great.\u000a Well, yeah, it kind of started eating people.\u000a That was wrong.\u000a Fabulous, but what could be some of the downfalls on that? Like, any negatives to cloning animals that are endangered or almost extinct?\u000a Well, hardly any of the \u000a You need to...\u000a The DNA might get messed up \u000a Yeah, but remember that when we're messing around with the DNA, yeah, maybe there could be a mistake. What happens then?\u000a \u000a It could die.\u000a It could die, yes.\u000a I would say. One good thing about bringing dinosaurs back is that you finally get to study them the way we want to.\u000a That's probably what scientists are thinking. "Wouldn't that be great if I could study something and actually be able to touch it and see what it does?" Because a lot of things they tell you about, you know, dinosaurs, is what they think they do. "Well, we think they eat this," and, "We think this is how they lived." Wouldn't it be great if we could actually study those?\u000a What if dinosaurs were never real?\u000a Well, they found skeleton remains, so they're pretty much sure they were around.\u000a They also found .  Because you can't just stick an animal in an environment and maybe it will survive, because it will mess up the chain of life.\u000a Anthony has a really good point, because what's going to happen if we have dinosaurs? We can't just stick them somewhere for them to roam around. Because they don't have anything they can naturally eat anymore. And they don't have any natural predators anymore.\u000a That's why you just bring back T-rexes and velociraptors. And what not. Then, you just feed them cows. \u000a You don't know if they necessarily eat cows, though. You don't know that.\u000a Well, it's meat.\u000a It is meat, but that's also your food source.\u000a Well, that's not going to be . Maybe eight or nine. Maybe 25 for a T-Rex. \u000a You're underestimating the size of some of these animals. But the same thing applies to actual animals, instead of just dinosaurs. What happens if we have animals that are going extinct because we are building new houses, and we're expanding our cities? So, we're moving into some areas where there are some animals, and they start to die off because we are taking over their land? So yeah, we could make a hundred copies of these animals, or whether it's plants, or birds, or certain insects. But that is a good question - where are they going to live if we just bring them back?\u000a Wildlife park.\u000a So, that is a good thing. And again, remember that you all add  because if you put them somewhere that  a park, they won't necessarily survive. So, you might need to think about all the other stuff that goes with that. So, yeah, the food chain. Interesting, how everything's connected. Raise your hand if you'd like to share one of your questions from yesterday. We'll start with Anthony.\u000a Okay, so like say me and this lady get married. We both can't have kids, so they take my DNA and they make a clone of me. I'm married to this person. Would that be only my child, or would that be our child?\u000a \u000a And if, why?\u000a \u000a Maybe, yeah.\u000a But what if you're married?\u000a \u000a Well, does it require two people that has your DNA? I'm sorry I didn't hear you.\u000a \u000a Maybe, it is. Maybe it's totally the environment. Who's to say? Maybe if you raise it, and you're like, "This is our kid..."\u000a Well, because of that case, then, there can't be any more like if we depended on cloning, there woudn't be any...  well, there'd be less drama in the world, because we wouldn't be... doing stuff the natural way. And, like, people being knocked up in bars and stuff,  and random places, and stuff, and, like, not knowing their father in life, you know. But you know what I'm saying, right?\u000a Do you think it would be hard?\u000a Like, what if people were 100% dependent on this? There would be a lot less problems.\u000a Eventually, if you keep cloning yourself, and then your clone cloned itself, and your clone clones itself...\u000a You'd have the same group of people.\u000a You'd have the best group ever.\u000a Yeah, but how would you know because you wouldn't be here.\u000a That's dumb, that's what that is.\u000a That's interesting.\u000a We can't have just a bunch of the same people. That'd be one stupid... That'd be dumb, man. \u000a I don't know. Walking around seeing all the same people?\u000a That's stupid! You're not going be like \u000a Like the Matrix, everything repeating?\u000a Other questions. Let's get one from a female this time. We got the guys' questions. Let's get a girl. Don't all shout out all at once. Mayra, what's one of your questions?\u000a I said, like, if they clone a sheep, and it's like, sick, wouldn't it... or let's say there's  a regular sheep, and they clone that, wouldn't the clone be sick, too?\u000a What did she say?\u000a Not necessarily.\u000a No, because it's like you said, it's two entire different bodies of life. A lot of things can go wrong in one person. So, how could it just be the same thing, two different ? Unless it's like a problem with an organ that the one had, and then .\u000a Well, I want to say that, like, a disesased kid \u000a Maybe. What about, remember, you just did genetics, right? If it's in your DNA, what would happen?\u000a If it was in your DNA...\u000a \u000a It probably would get it. If it was something that it caught, it probably wouldn't get it.\u000a That's true. So it depends, I guess, maybe what it is. Right? So you have this sheep, just cloned it, and because it has something very serious with it, and if it's genetic, then yeah, there's probably a chance that that clone would probably have the exact same disorder later on. I think they were showing... Remember when they were doing Dolly and they showed some of the animals they had cloned? I think they were talking about the sheep, Dolly, and then they had some mice that they had cloned. They had said that the animals  they had cloned... does anyone remember what any of the side effects... what they've noticed?\u000a  \u000a Sometimes they can't breathe right. What else?\u000a  \u000a Sometimes they died really young. So, just because it's a clone... maybe we haven't quite figured it out yet. Because it seems like maybe there are some issues with the animals actually coming out healthy or normal, if they're dying younger or having problems growing. Other questions? Hector, what is one of your questions? Or, if you don't have your questions ready, or you feel like  your questions were answered, maybe you just have a comment. \u000a You have none? What do you think about cloning?  Do you agree with it? Or are there are certain places or times you would agree with it?\u000a Um, I agree with it. Like, the pros I would agree with it,  like, for food?\u000a For what?\u000a Like cloning for more food?\u000a Oh, like the chickens? Right? Cloning to make more chickens. Wouldn't it be great if I have a perfect chicken, and I could make a hundred copies of the same perfect chicken? \u000a I've had all types of chickens. They all taste the same. \u000a That's true.\u000a Everything tastes like chicken.\u000a But have you ever gotten like a really tiny drumstick, and then you got like the nice meaty drumstick?\u000a Well, like a tiny little drumstick. They still taste good. \u000a True, but what one gives you more food?\u000a You got a point there.\u000a Okay, so maybe, right...\u000a But still, you could put them together...\u000a In the case of KFC, the reason why their chicken's so big is because they put hormones in them to make them big.\u000a Yes. That's the way they approach that.\u000a That's the best way to do that right there.\u000a Not really. People get cancer from that.\u000a So, would this be a good solution? So instead of making... eating... our cows and feeding pigs, and feeding chickens these extra vitamins and extra hormones, to make them larger and grow faster, would it better to just take the large, big cows and just clone them? Or make chicken and make copies of it? Yes? No?\u000a Does anyone see any... maybe. This sounds really great, like we're going to make these big meaty chickens so that everybody has a lot of chicken that they can eat, but is there any downside to that?\u000a No. Honestly, no, I don't think so.\u000a Not for you. Great. Is there anybody else?\u000a Money.\u000a Money how?\u000a They could cost more to , but they could cost less and be more affordable, which is what we want.\u000a Good. Money is a good issue, right? People won't have to think about money issues?\u000a I don't think there'd be a money issue if you were cloning chickens, because you can always just get, you know, take a syringe and, like...\u000a But that's what he was saying, that maybe it'd be cheaper if they could make it without using as much stuff.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a It would take longer.\u000a What do you guys think about the cloning for body parts?\u000a Can I go back to the chickens for a second?\u000a Sure, go for it.\u000a Wouldn't there be a lot less farmers, so then there'd be a lot less jobs because, you know, like the whole...\u000a That is true.\u000a Like a lot of companies will go out of business because, I don't know, I feel like there's like a monopoly on it,\u000a More private industries are going to go out of business, and that's going to destroy livelihoods. Because all the big livestock companies like KFC and McDonald's... well, they're not a livestock company, they're fast food.\u000a But they're going to be selling it to those , right? They're going to let it go off of...\u000a Just by show of hands, who in here might have a problem eating food if they knew that it had been genetically messed around with?\u000a That's just because you guys are okay with dying. \u000a Chris, not sure, or does it just kind of...\u000a I don't care, really. \u000a What was the question?\u000a Oh, I said would you be bothered if you ate genetically modified food?\u000a No, before that. The one before Anthony started talking.\u000a We were trying to see if there was any downside of cloning chickens.\u000a We'll get there. I know the question. We'll get there.\u000a I want to say something.\u000a We'll get there. Alright. Erica. Medical, the cloning the body parts, like if people are sick and they need a new heart, or new lungs, or a new kidney.\u000a Ms. Scott, I wrote the name of it. It's called Therapeutic Cloning. They refer to it that way. So, that's what it's called when you do that.\u000a So when we're using it, for cloning for the organs for individuals who have issues, whether it's, like just a few cells, or like nervous cells for people who had spinal cord injuries... what do you think about that?\u000a I think it's a good idea.\u000a It's a good idea? Do you have any reasons to be worried about that?\u000a \u000a It would be better than nothing? Any concerns. Anybody else?\u000a Have you heard of of a book called ? What was it called?\u000a \u000a I don't think I have. What's it about?\u000a \u000a That's okay.  Levon is going to have to read it now, because he'll be like, "What?"\u000a It's about, like, in the future, will people, if parents don't want their kids any more, they can, like, they can give them a , like they can take their other body parts off and... they can take their other body parts off of them and stuff, so they  like your body parts are still alive,  so one arm could be like your real arm, and your other arm could be like .\u000a Interesting. I'll have to read that book sometime. Now, when they're doing the therapeutic cloning, they're not actually creating, like, a whole new human, and then  the body parts up. There's a couple of different ways they were doing it.\u000a \u000a Do you remember what they were using to... how they were growing the organs?\u000a \u000a That is true. But what were they trying to do with the cloning? How are they trying to avoid that? Do you remember? Does anybody remember? How is cloning supposed to help your body to keep from rejecting? Because...\u000a Do you guys remember what happened to the woman...\u000a Close. Very close to that.  So, remember when you get a body organ, like the lady with the kidney, right? Who'd she get the kidney from?\u000a  Her aunt.\u000a Yeah, so she got it from her aunt. Somebody she was not even related to that just happens to be part of the family. Like, they were a match. She had to take... remember all of those pills she had to take? To make sure her body doesn't, like, get rid of the kidney. And then, unfortunately, it still did? So, they're looking at getting, making kidneys, and I think that they were growing them inside of a cow. I think it was a cow. Might have been a pig. It was a big animal.\u000a So, you're going to grow human kidneys that are functional?\u000a Mm hmm.\u000a On a cow? They were using another animal, and they were actually growing it, like, not in the animal. It wasn't part of the animal. They were using the animal as a place to keep it growing and functioning.\u000a So on the outside of a cow, there'd be kidneys.\u000a Underneath the skin. Yep. And then they would take take them out, and transplant them into humans.\u000a This is like that episode of South Park where... it's a little bit inappropriate, but not too much.\u000a Then let's not go there. It's a little too inappropriate, then let's not.\u000a Nevermind. Nevermind. You're going to watch it for yourself.\u000a Fabulous. But they are also trying, by cloning, because remember a lot of times they're trying to find animal parts that might match. Like for example, did you know a pig heart is about the same size as a human heart?\u000a So, you could have a pig heart?\u000a They were thinking about taking pig hearts and transplanting them into people that needed new hearts. The problem is, of course, is it's a pig's heart, which means the outside of the heart looks like, pig cells. So, your body would know that it's not a human heart. It would know that it's a pig heart. And your body probably won't want that in its body. So, they were trying, remember they had, trying to grow new pigs? I think they had little piglets running around? The pigs had human DNA in there to make the outside of their hearts and the outside of their lungs, and kidneys all kind of copy what a human cell would look like on the outside? So, that when they keep those body parts, if they put them in a human, your body wouldn't recognize it as being something different.\u000a \u000a Did you know they've actually done that?\u000a My dad's friend's daughter has pig intestines.\u000a

V Look at your station one information. And the question we posed in station one was does temperature affect the rate of chemical weather. And yesterday, you guys constructed a graph to show that data. Why is it useful to construct a graph in science class? Sky?\u000a Because it's a visual way to show you information.\u000a It's a visual way to show you information. I have a case up here as an example. Based on that graph, what does that pattern reveal about our question? Gabrielle.\u000a The cooler the temperature the more the, I mean, more increases in time.\u000a The more what increases in time?\u000a The more uh weather.\u000a Okay, anybody want to restate that, Rebecca?\u000a The colder it is, the more time it takes to weather.\u000a Very good. The colder it is, the more time it takes to weather. If we're talking about dissolving a tablet, is that chemical weathering or mechanical weathering? Logan?\u000a Chemical weathering.\u000a Chemical weathering. So the colder it is, the longer it takes for the chemical weathering to occur. Would you agree? Thumbs up or thumbs down. Thumbs up, I would agree. Now I want to talk about, so what? Why does it matter to us. Why does it matter in our daily lives. Talk about it for one minute, record your thoughts on your wipe board, and be ready to share back. \u000a We could consider where to build our stuff...\u000a In what types of areas would you have to be specifically and particularly hot? What about up north? You've got 30 seconds to finish writing your thoughts. \u000a Okay, it might dissolve faster in a warmer place. Or, what type of rock would I want to avoid? Limestone, why? \u000a Okay, very good, very good. Alright, let's share some of our ideas with the class. Info managers, table three, what did you find?\u000a If you live in a cold environment, there will be less chemical weathering, than there is in a warm place.\u000a Good point, if you live in a cooler environment, there will be less chemical weathering than in a warm climate. Who's gonna be particularly concerned with this? What, for instance, job field is gonna be concerned with this idea? Forrest?\u000a Construction?\u000a That would be one area, what else?\u000a Statue building?\u000a Yeah, any kind of artist who's designing statues. What type of rock would you want to avoid if you're living in a warm area? And you know that chemical weathering could be a problem. What rock would you avoid? Patrick?\u000a Limestone.\u000a Limestone. Do you guys have some proof for me? Somewhere in your data as to why we should avoid limestone? Which station, Alex?\u000a Station three.\u000a Flip to station three for me. At station three, who can explain to me what the lab was that you did? Someone I haven't heard from, Colin?\u000a We put one small piece of chalk into a bottle of vinegar and a small piece of chalk into water, and we saw if the acid from the vinegar dissolved the chalk and if the water dissolved the chalk. And the chalk didn't dissolve in the water, but the acid made it fizz, bubble, and it was just dissolving.\u000a And why did we use chalk? What is chalk a type of? What is chalk a type of, Jeremy?\u000a It's a type of limestone.\u000a It's a type of limestone. So your evidence showed that yes, limestone weathers quickly with acid. Why is acid a part of our environment? How does it become part of our environment? Andrea?\u000a Acid rain.\u000a Acid rain, acid rain. Now, as we grow up it's important that you're environmental advocates. That you fight for protecting our environment. What types of things can you do in your lives to cut down on acid rain? Give me two ideas on your wipe boards. Two ideas. \u000a Is that polluting our water, our air?\u000a Polluting the air, and it's getting into our clouds...\u000a Very nice, very good. So air pollution particularly because the air pollution contributes to that formation.\u000a You are making worst case scenarios. You don't have to consider the unthinkable.\u000a It can happen, alright?\u000a You don't have to consider the impossible.\u000a So we can unplug outlets when we're not using them.\u000a We can turn off the water when we brush our teeth. \u000a What about things in your house? Electricity. Cut down on your electric bills. Remember you burn fossil fuels, to make electricity. So right now as middle schoolers, the easiest thing to do would be to cut down on your electric use. Alright, I want every table to share one idea. Info manager from table one, give me one idea.\u000a One idea is we can help the environment by taking a bus to school, instead of like everybody having their own individual cars.\u000a Good point.\u000a Or even better you can walk.\u000a Instead of having that carpool line going on, let's take busses. Table two give me one idea.\u000a Save power by changing your lightbulbs to CFLs.\u000a Yeah, use those light bulbs that are like the twirly light bulbs, they use a lot less electricity, good idea. Table three give me one.\u000a Conserve water by turning off the water when we brush our teeth.\u000a Now conserving water. Think about what the question was. How can we be environmental advocates to cut down on acid rain?\u000a We can cut down on electricity by unplugging outlets.\u000a Very good. Unplug items from the outlets, that's good. Table four.\u000a We could use hybrid cars.\u000a Hybrid cars, that's good. They burn less fossil fuels, good idea. Table five.\u000a Recycle.\u000a Recycle.  How would that help acid rain? Okay, so it's cutting down on factory use, that would be a good one. Table six.\u000a Cutting down on electricity.\u000a Alright, cutting down on electricity, because to make electricity you have to burn fossil fuels. Table seven, is there any that haven't been said?\u000a Carpool to work and school.\u000a Carpool to work and school, I love it. You got something to add?\u000a I was going to say instead of the bottles end up in landfills, so you can keep bottles out of landfills if you reuse them.\u000a Yeah, very good. A lot of times we focus only on the idea of recycling, but it's good to reuse, too. That's a good idea as well. So we talked about how the temperature will affect our chemical weathering. We haven't yet talked about how temperature affects mechanical weathering. Which lab would answer that question? How temperature affects mechanical weathering.\u000a Station four.\u000a Alright, look at station four. Take one minute, you don't have to write this one down, discuss it. What does station four tell you and how is that important in daily life. Take one minute. \u000a And it like ice wedges, and then it'll make bigger cracks and then it will do bad stuff for sidewalks. \u000a What were you supposed to be measuring? In centimeters. You measured in milimeters, but you meant to measure in centimeters.\u000a So how much was it in centimeters? Well if you said it was at 79, which would be right there. What centimeters is that at?\u000a Around 15.\u000a Write down 15. Oh wait wait! I had it going the wrong way, and no one even noticed. So if it was at 79, where would it be. At 79, the tick mark right below the 80.\u000a About 16.\u000a About 16, and if it was at 76 where would it be at?\u000a About 14 and a half.\u000a Very good Alright, let's pick someone at random, who's the lucky person, Andrew P. What did you notice was the difference between the same amount of water when it was frozen and when it was left as a liquid.\u000a When it was frozen it was taller.\u000a When it was frozen it was taller. What does that mean that it was taller? Lucy?\u000a Well the water was frozen to ice. So it expands a little.\u000a It expands. I like the use of that word. Water expands as it freezes. Here in Louisville how is that a problem? And it's been a particularly big problem this winter. Ethan?\u000a Because like, the water can get in the cracks in the roads and then when it freezes it will expand and it will crack roads and buildings. Soon the people will have the construction people will have to rebuild the roads.\u000a Right, very good point. Now that affects us here in Kentucky because we have those cold winters. What types of areas would it not affect? Forrest?\u000a Florida.\u000a Florida, areas that don't have freezing that's a good point. Now we've talked about climate as far as temperature goes. We've talked about the warm temperatures and the cold temperatures and how it affects the chemical and mechanical weathering. What is the other aspect of climate, other than temperatures? Other than temperature, what is another aspect of climate? Patrick?\u000a How humid it is?\u000a How humid it is. Which lab do you think would tell us how humidity affects weather? Flip through, Sky?\u000a Seven Let's look at station seven. Now, during our labs, the materials managers were always in charge of getting the materials ready. A material manager. Can someone explain to me, what's the difference between the steel wool that was covered with a cup versus the steel wool that was not covered with a cup. What would that difference be? Lucy?\u000a Well the steel wool that was covered, well the steel wool that wasn't covered with the cup, it was all like stuck together and it wasn't rusting and the one that was covered with the cup it had like stuff popping out, like it wasn't all stuck together and it was rusting.\u000a Okay, so the one that was covered with a cup and moistened, had a lot of rust. And the one that was moistened, but was just left sitting out dried and did not have a lot of rust. Would you agree? Okay, what is the purpose of covering it? Why do I cover that? Otis?\u000a Keeping the water from evaporating. Yeah, it's keeping that water in. So is the covered cup a dry environment, or a humid environment?\u000a Humid environment.\u000a A very humid environment. I have a great map here that tells you a little bit about different areas, and tells you what their humidity is like. I'm gonna flip off both lights to help you see it. This is a tropical wet area, tropical dry area, semi-arid which means dry, arid, then, marine, west coast, Mediterranean, and humid sub-tropical. These areas that are marked as humid, sub-tropical, such as down in Florida, those areas that are marked as humid, what do they have to be cautious about? If it's a humid area, what do they have to be cautious about? Don't see a lot of hands, talk about it for one minute. What do humid areas have to be cautious about? \u000a Now think about this, an area like Kentucky. And our summers aren't just hot, they're humid. So we have to deal with cold winters which are gonna affect mechanical weathering, and we have to deal with, Yeah, so we're kind of getting the worst end of both scenarios. Yes, we definitely are. Good point. Alright, I need someone I haven't heard from to share, let's see who the random card is, Lucy. What do you think?\u000a They have to be careful about rusting like their cars and stuff.\u000a They have to be careful of rusting. Good point.  Because the more humid the air is, the more likely you are to have what? Oxidation. Now there was another lab where we used steel wool. What was the purpose of the other steel wool lab? What were you trying to answer, what were you trying to determine? Jamiel, what do you think? \u000a There was the key word, the what kind of water? Salt water. You look to see if salt water affected the oxidation rate. You look to see if salt water did. Silently, look at your data, and tell me did salt water affect the rate of oxidation. Jeremy, did salt water affect the rate of oxidation?\u000a Yeah\u000a

V What do you think it is going to be this time? I think it's going to be like negative 57, 59.\u000a Maybe like 54 or something.\u000a Colder or hotter. You don't need to touch...\u000a You don't need to touch it. You and your temperature. \u000a  I got a  playing with your .\u000a Go down.\u000a  The temperature is going to go down with the ice.\u000a It was 22.\u000a  22, no not 22.\u000a  You think  ice the temperature is going to go down? \u000a The water went up.\u000a It's your choice how much of anything you put in. \u000a Should we put a lot?\u000a A little more.\u000a A little more.\u000a Why don't you dump it into ?\u000a Not the whole thing.\u000a Yeah. Oh! \u000a  Don't put it all in like that. There's hardly any room.\u000a Ready?\u000a Go. \u000a Science is kind of messy, isn't it? It's okay. Just put it back in there and work together.\u000a Tell me when to go.\u000a Ready?\u000a Ready and start.\u000a What do you think? I think it's going to be like maybe 20 degrees.\u000a Or maybe negative 10.\u000a We'll just have to see. \u000a 40, Jacob, 40.\u000a  No, it's 50. 40.\u000a 50 degrees, it's almost.\u000a It's 50 degrees, Jake. It's 50 degrees. It's 50 degrees, Jake. What's he doing.\u000a  So where's the line? Try to put one in.\u000a Oh, so now you get it?\u000a Where's the line?\u000a  And it's 40.\u000a 40, comes out like 44.\u000a  What's the temperature?\u000a It changed.\u000a 44. It says 40.\u000a  No, it's 44.\u000a Jacob, it doesn't matter.\u000a  What are you having a dispute about here.  get out now.\u000a It was right here.\u000a So it's on.\u000a It's not even gone down.\u000a And now it went up to what? Well, a little higher than that. Yours went up, so what did, how do you know, Jacob, by looking at the thermometer, how it went up or down? Explain to me.\u000a I know how it went up because I see, because if you turn your head away and then you look at it, it went up.\u000a You think so? How do you read this, though? \u000a Are they? There's five lines right, let's see, but how do you break it up so you can read it to get from 70 to 80? How do you break that up, Jacob, do you know?\u000a Um.\u000a Right, you count by twos. Okay, you guys get busy, I'm interrupting your experimental time, you're scientists here. \u000a  Down, all the way down.\u000a  Just color it up to 50.\u000a  Down 30. I wonder what was in it.\u000a I think it's salt.\u000a I don't think it's salt.\u000a Last time I used, last time I used it it went down, and then it went down even more. \u000a That's what I told you.\u000a It's floating.\u000a I'm breathing in good water. Water.\u000a What happened? \u000a Use the thermometer. Ready, set, go.  one more. \u000a I think it's going to get colder, and . I think it's going to get .\u000a I think it's going to get negative 10.\u000a What do you think, Emily?\u000a  Zero degrees. \u000a  Maybe negative zero.\u000a I'm not sure there is a negative zero.\u000a It's like frost all over it.\u000a Cold.\u000a Frost right here.\u000a Whatever was in it makes it go down.\u000a Temperature go down, makes frost. \u000a Mystery  is salt. The mystery grain is salt. The mystery grain is salt, it's melting the ice.\u000a  And it's condensing on the outside.\u000a  Ready guys?\u000a  Five, four.\u000a  What do you guys think it is? What do you think the temperature's going to be this time?\u000a I don't know.\u000a Lower than 50.\u000a 555 degrees?\u000a That would be toasty. Got to be lower.\u000a  One, two, three, four, five. I see that most of you have finished your experiment. I would like to call and see. I'm going to get some questions.\u000a Take it out.\u000a Okay, eight. I have questions. Teagan, your group needs to come to me, please. Thank you, very good. Jacob, what did you notice between the base temperature and the first time when you put the water in, what happened?\u000a I noticed that when the base temperature, when we put in the base temperature, it was only water, it only changed by one degree.\u000a  It only changed by one degree. Very good. Number nine, who's number nine? Kayla, Kayla. What did you guys notice about the temperature?\u000a We...\u000a  What happened to it, what happened to the temperature?\u000a It went down.\u000a  It went down. What happened to your can, who knows? Think about that, take a minute with your group, I want you to talk about what's happening to your can, and why. \u000a  So maybe it got frost for .\u000a They get more frost on it. When I put, and it got yellow. The water was clear and then it got yellow when we put salt in.\u000a  It got dirty. _  It looks like lemonade.\u000a It's all mushy.\u000a The  stuff is looking to the ice that--\u000a And making it squishy.\u000a  Okay, one, two, three, four, five, come back to me for a minute. I pulled number five. Number five, what is happening to your can?\u000a It's getting frost on it.\u000a  It's getting frost on it. Why do you think it's getting frost? What did your group think that it was getting frost on it from?\u000a The ice and the mystery ingredient.\u000a  The mystery ingredient and the ice are making the can frosty. What did we learn about, with the weather cycle, we talked about that, what's really happening? Talk in your group, is it the can making the water come on in and make the frost? Talk in your group and figure out if you guys know what's coming that's making the stuff on the outside of the can. \u000a There is water on the side of the can.\u000a Maybe the mystery thing...\u000a  Making condensation on the can? And because I learned a lot about that--\u000a I think the mystery one and the ice did it together.\u000a That could be.\u000a Yeah, that could be.\u000a And combined and then it created frost on the outside of the can.\u000a  I think that the water, the mystery ingredient, .\u000a  Okay, one, two, three, four, five. Number three, what is making your can get the frost or the wet stuff, what's that wet stuff called? Ella.\u000a Condensation.\u000a  It's called condensation. What do you, why is that happening to your can? Number three, that's you right Luke? Okay, what's happening?\u000a Because it's like evaporating, and when it touches the cold can, then it turns back into cold water.\u000a  What's evaporating? Stop, don't answer that. Think in your group, what, he said it's evaporating, and then it's touching the can. What's touching the can? Talk in your group, figure out if you can figure out what's coming to touch your can.\u000a So well really it  can.\u000a Yeah, it's kind of melting, so the water is on the can...\u000a So it's the mushy, icky...\u000a I know whatever mystery stuff.\u000a  Now I'll take it. It makes me, and then it makes water, water, water. Everything, you know, water.\u000a  How will Eve's last question?\u000a  Nope, we're just asking questions right this second. You guys need to wait, then we're gonna . One, two, three, four, five, come back to me. Number 19, who's 19?\u000a Ella.\u000a  Okay, Ella. What is happening to make that can wet on the outside?\u000a The water and the ice, well the water tries to evaporate, but since there's ice at the top, it hits the ice, and then it comes back down. But then it gets on the can.\u000a  So the water, you think the water, in the, the can itself is coming and making that water come back on and catch that, hit the ice. Good thought, let's keep going, let's see if we can get some more. Who is number 12?\u000a  Hayden.\u000a  Hayden's not here, so let's move on and let's find number nine. Who's number nine?\u000a Kayla.\u000a Kayla. Kayla, what's happening to your can, what's happening to it and why?\u000a It frosting.\u000a  It's frosting.\u000a

V This one is probably medium. So this one is mine.\u000a So this has to be a medium.\u000a And this one has to be a large because... My medium is half way up to here. So it has to be a large.\u000a So you make a prediction about how many small rocks it takes to make a big.\u000a I think it's gonna be 12 small rocks.\u000a That's a good idea. Put our small rocks we have here so we make it, draw two little blocks and if we have 12.\u000a Draw a rectangle and just put, put your line through right here.\u000a What do you think how many small rocks? \u000a I think that there is going to be eight. We have eight rocks. So I think that there's going to be What about you?\u000a I have 10, 11, 12.\u000a Boys and girls I had a good question. If you've got more rocks than you do boxes, you know that we've got how many boxes? How many boxes?\u000a Ten.\u000a There's ten. So at the top you can write, since we've been working with place value with tens and ones you can put ten. We know that's how many boxes we have. You could put plus six if you have which number?\u000a 16.\u000a 16. If you all had 11 what could you do? You got ten so you would write plus one. If you had 12 you would write, you've got 10 so what would you write above it? Plus two. So you can do it that way. Good question.\u000a Now what about you make a prediction of five then you ask us how many baby rocks we think that ten makes.  \u000a I think that there is going to be...\u000a These can be large. And there's one, two three, four, four larges.  \u000a He's already told you how many mediums there are.  \u000a However you think. Very good. So you've got yours sorted by size or you could see if there's another way you can sort your rocks?\u000a We just did size first so we could do our work.\u000a Very smart. Very smart. Tell me about looking at the graph how many small you had Diana. How many small rocks were there?\u000a Five.\u000a Alright how many medium rocks did you have?\u000a 11.\u000a And how many large?\u000a Four.\u000a Good, good and you sorted them. Oh, you got some nice rocks. Oooh. Nice rock there, it's pretty.\u000a Neat. \u000a Now this looks much better, much better.\u000a Medium, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, \u000a Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.  \u000a Wait, wait. One, two, three, four, five...\u000a Now we need five more to make 15.  \u000a One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, \u000a Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,\u000a I counted 14.  \u000a Put them together.\u000a One, two, three, four. \u000a I'd say like maybe it goes with the white.\u000a Okay, what about this one?\u000a That goes with the white right? \u000a What about this one?\u000a Hmm, I'd say like, what does it have the most of? I'd say probably white.\u000a What about this one?\u000a This one goes for tan.\u000a This one is, this one goes. This one goes too.\u000a This goes with the gray too.\u000a This one goes to the--\u000a I think it goes.\u000a It goes with the white. \u000a Now let's see. I think it's a pretty rock. Wait, oh.\u000a That one goes there.\u000a I know it. They all do. Wait, these go with the green. No this one, this one is gray.\u000a It's still got sand in it.\u000a This one is green and at least it looks a little bit greenish. I'd say like maybe green too. We'll have all yes. Okay, now this rock. Okay Diana, Cam and Gaelin. What I want you to do is you'll probably, how about you just take the rocks. Because I can't remember.\u000a What's going on?\u000a We're sorting them a different way.\u000a You're sorting them a different way. And what way would that be? How did you all decide to sort rocks?\u000a I thought we'd sort them by color and now we're gonna do it by cut.\u000a Tell me that again because I don't, I don't know that part. \u000a Now since we did the color, we're going to do is, we're going to do by texture.\u000a What's texture?\u000a It's by how it feels.\u000a Oh, well can you teach me?\u000a Find out the texture from these two rocks, I see how it feels. And since this one feels very smooth I'll put it by itself.\u000a Well, can I feel it?\u000a Pretty smooth.\u000a Pretty smooth. Have you felt it? Feel it. How you think it feels?\u000a Smooth.\u000a It does feel pretty smooth.\u000a And it looks like a piece of meat.\u000a It looks like a piece a meat?\u000a Yes.\u000a Better not eat a rock should I? Okay, where does this one need to go?\u000a It needs to go.\u000a Over here?\u000a We haven't finished quite yet so...\u000a Okay.\u000a And this one is like I'll say pretty rough.\u000a Pretty rough, can I feel this one? Oh gosh. Whoo. Yeah. It does feel a little rough. It does feel like it's got some sand on it. You know a word that I can think of that makes me think of that?\u000a Rough.\u000a Rough or gritty. You know sand is gritty feeling. Well, that's kind of gritty. It does feel a little rough.\u000a It can stand up.\u000a It stands up?\u000a I'm gonna do it, put it by itself.\u000a Okay.\u000a And we're going to keep on doing it. Until all of them are sorted.\u000a Okay, this is a pretty cool rock, how does it feel?\u000a I'll say pretty bumpy kind of rock.\u000a Pretty bumpy, pretty rough. Oh, this one's very rough.\u000a So rough I can hardly stand myself.\u000a Look at the shell on it. \u000a It does have a shell in it.\u000a On the other side, look. On the other side turn it like right here, it has another shell.\u000a It does, so what kind of rock would this be?\u000a A two fossil rock.\u000a A fossil rock. And what kind are they, what's it called? If it has a fossil imprint in it?\u000a Fossil.\u000a If it settled and got a fossil?\u000a Sedimentary.\u000a It would be a sedimentary rock. Very cool. I'm so proud of you. That was definitely very rough. Have you felt it?\u000a This is.\u000a What do you think?\u000a On, the back is kind of squishy.\u000a It is rough. Okay, you all keep working, you're doing a good job. I'm proud of you.\u000a Okay. Now you can put it with the rough, the super rough. I think this one is, I can tell. I say medium, a little rough, a little smooth. This one goes in the middle.\u000a This one is smooth.\u000a This is super rough. Let me feel.\u000a Smooth.\u000a I'm gonna put it in the middle because I think--    \u000a Very good Arianna, I like the way you--   \u000a One more medium rock than large. Because we have eight medium and seven large.\u000a Because you can see...\u000a A smooth side and a rough side.   \u000a Because if you add two more together it make 12. Medium is seven and large is eight.\u000a And I have an idea, when you do your rock what about you trace it?\u000a

V  What are you noticing about it compared to these two?\u000a This one's light brown. These are all dark. So I think this one's not getting enough water. So we should water it.\u000a What's happening because it's not getting enough water?\u000a It's like drying out.\u000a What's happening to the seed?\u000a The seed is dying. It can't grow.\u000a And the seed's gonna die.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Because what's the first stage of a life cycle?\u000a And you have water in it.\u000a It's a seed.\u000a Yeah.\u000a And then it sprouts.\u000a But on this one all stems are dying.\u000a Oh wow, that looks really dry.\u000a So which one are you measuring?\u000a We're measuring water.\u000a Okay, let's measure it.\u000a Let me measure it.\u000a Okay, let's measure it and let's record how tall it is.\u000a I don't know how you use it. \u000a Yeah, almost four inches.\u000a Centimeters. Here, I'll measure it.\u000a Seven and a half centimeters.\u000a Can you hold it, yeah?\u000a Maybe if you hold it.\u000a Oh no, it came out.\u000a It's okay.\u000a It's alright we'll just--\u000a Ours came out, and then it's still good.\u000a Just hold him up.\u000a It's six centimeters.\u000a Okay, let's check.\u000a Wow, it's growing two times enough.\u000a Keep it there and let's see. Let's see if the rest of your group agrees.\u000a Yeah, I agree.\u000a That leaf is up to six centimeters.\u000a Okay, so what in, in a week, how much has it grown?\u000a It's grown three.\u000a Three centimeters.\u000a Three centimeters, yeah.\u000a Three centimeters.\u000a Okay, write and record it. So that's parsley. Write, write.  Why do you think parsley is doing so much better than roma tomato?\u000a Because the tomato is like, a tomato has one thing, and parsley has the same thing and they come out.\u000a What do you mean the same?\u000a I think maybe because parsley.\u000a Because parsley has, a rose, it's easier because, because a tomato has more time to grow, because it like, it's the kind of vegetable that has...\u000a Which is actually even drier.\u000a Can you guys help her out? Can you help her out?\u000a I think, well I think that's growing better than the roma tomatoes.\u000a Is tomato a fruit?\u000a Day one.\u000a Like it's growing a fruit, that's what the tomato is. Like a vegetable, it's the fruit of the plant.\u000a Yeah.\u000a That we eat.\u000a But I think that, what I think it's important is that we grow this.\u000a Yes.\u000a Yes, they'll grow at different times. Once they grow, it'll grow fast.\u000a Yeah, we started this one, planting faster, right? We started this one two weeks later. Do you think we need to water the tomato more though?\u000a Yeah.\u000a When you look at the parsley and feel, feel how wet that one is. And it's doing so well.\u000a I know.\u000a Compared to the tomato, maybe we need to water more?\u000a Yes.\u000a Is this parse? It's the parts?\u000a  No it's the gender.\u000a  I think they need to get more sun and water.\u000a Okay, so Abby's measuring her tomato.\u000a  I did it.\u000a  What do you guys want to do? Do you want to do the top of the leaf or should we do the top of the stem?\u000a Top of the leaf.\u000a  Top of the leaf. The leaf is part of the plant.\u000a  Okay, so you're putting it down, all the way down?\u000a Down and round.\u000a It's four.\u000a Okay.\u000a It's four.\u000a Alright.\u000a Four.\u000a So every single time when you measure this plant, are you gonna measure the top of the leaf not the top of the stem? Is that what you're going to do?\u000a Yeah.\u000a It started four sessions ago. It started four sessions ago. \u000a This one started two weeks before. This one. Let's look at the measurements, and how much for growing, can you compare these two? What are some things that you notice?\u000a I notice that--\u000a It's grown three and a quarter centimeters. Everything else, won't be able to have.  two more centimeters.\u000a G plant.\u000a Can you tell me which one's growing quicker?\u000a This one are pregnant.\u000a Are you sure about that?\u000a Yes. Actually, maybe because...\u000a This started out, and this one not so here before.\u000a Okay, and we started this one when?\u000a We started this on, I mean two weeks ago.\u000a Two weeks after this one.\u000a Yeah.\u000a So, even though this one was started later, what's happened? It's growing.\u000a More.\u000a Faster, taller, yup. Okay. Why do you think, and you guys even noticed that it was dry, and it's still growing faster.\u000a Yeah.\u000a So, should we keep water, should we water it more and see what happens?\u000a Yeah.\u000a What do you want to do?\u000a I want to, want to, since there's no more seeds in there, because we took two of them out and then the other one died. I think we should grow more seeds in there and then water it and see what happens.\u000a Okay, go ahead, you can plant it. And there are sometimes seeds, they just won't germinate. They're sometimes just like a bad seed and they just won't, they won't grow. Maybe that's what happened to this one too.\u000a Can I go through and bob it?\u000a But in the inside of it, it looks very dark. But the outside of it does.\u000a So maybe it's not as dry as we thought.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Now we have to take measurements again.\u000a We'll just see if that helps.\u000a There's only this one left.\u000a Let's look at this seed. What do you notice about it?\u000a I know for, we came from last time when we grow the parsley, this seed is way bigger than that parsley seed.\u000a  These are not dead.\u000a  How about compared to the sunflower seed or a pumpkin seed?\u000a  It's really small. And things can use the lines smaller maybe, because they're smaller things, or like a sunflower.\u000a Oh, so you think maybe the seed, the size of the seed tells you how big the plant is going to be?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay.\u000a On that, some of the tomatoes are as big as that, or bigger than that. Sometimes the seeds are, how they start out are smaller, but sometimes the shape of it, sometimes determines the shape of it sometimes, but others not.\u000a You mean the seed tells you the shape of the plant?\u000a Sometimes, yeah.\u000a It could.\u000a What about a flower or something?\u000a Flowers seeds are different.\u000a They all look different.\u000a No.\u000a So is that always the case?\u000a No.\u000a But some of your classmates have plants that are gonna grow bigger. And so maybe we should ask them about theirs and find out if their plant is growing faster, or slower compared to these two plants, than yours. And maybe we can see if the seed size makes a difference. Alright, you guys can get online. Yeah, you can go ahead and water it.\u000a One in here, and one in here.\u000a And then I want you to go to that website and start your graphs when you'e done. You might want to water it a lot more.\u000a Let me try.\u000a And then over it.\u000a  We finished watering our plants.\u000a  Do we each get a computer?\u000a We need help. When we type into trying capitals in it, it deleted our numbers. So.\u000a Okay.\u000a We didn't know what was wrong.\u000a Well you have your title, Plant Type. Let's be more specific because you're not doing all the plants. What plant are you graphing right now?\u000a Swiss chard.\u000a And?\u000a Kale.\u000a Did you measure them already?\u000a Yeah. And then we drag the numbers but then they don't...\u000a I think it's because of all that room.\u000a James, where is your measurement for swiss chard for today?\u000a Right here.\u000a You want to record that.\u000a Swiss chard. \u000a And kale was...\u000a What was kale again?\u000a Seven.\u000a This height look correct?\u000a No.\u000a What are we missing? Do you guys notice?\u000a The up need.\u000a Oh, I notice.\u000a There you go, alright. Okay, so what's going to be your label for your bar graph? That's the one going along the bottom.\u000a The bottom, the plant height? How high the plant reading?\u000a Are you gonna, what are you gonna graph then for your bars?\u000a Hmm.\u000a What do we always look at when we're thinking about our graphs? We always go back to our data table, right?\u000a What are we gonna do instead of getting ahead or not?\u000a Seven centimeters for kale.\u000a You're gonna have to put kale right there.\u000a I know. It's just, that was the big plan. I think I'm on the tail now because...\u000a Okay you have, what's this one?\u000a That was eggplant.\u000a Okay. And this is swiss chard?\u000a Yeah. Well here's that, why don't you measure that? You haven't measured it yet.\u000a About five centimeters.\u000a Did you agree Walt?\u000a Yeah, about five centimeters.\u000a Is that what you got too?\u000a Yeah. \u000a So why are we gonna have a graph for just swiss chard, and just kale? Or are we gonna have a graph for both together? What would be easier?\u000a Both together I think.\u000a Should we put it together? How would we do that? How would you merge that?\u000a I think like both should have their own bar, like in the same graph.\u000a I think so too. So which plant do you want to graph today? Are you gonna do swiss chard or kale?\u000a  They really needed help.\u000a  Let's do kale.\u000a Let's look at kale.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  What's kale?\u000a Here's the kale.\u000a  Which one are we measuring?\u000a James, what did you get for the height for kale?\u000a Seven centimeters.\u000a Okay look, see if Andrew gets seven.\u000a Yeah, about seven.\u000a Okay. And what was the height of it last week, James? So Andrew knows.\u000a It was six centimeters.\u000a Okay, it was six centimeters. So just put six centimeters here. There you go. Okay, so lets fix this, let's just make it kale height. Or grow. And then, what's this, what are you gonna put at the bottom? Look at your table.\u000a  The height of kale.\u000a Is that gonna go along the bottom?\u000a How tall it was, like in day one and day two.\u000a Let's look. What were the labels for our table?\u000a Date and measurement.\u000a Okay, so that's what we're going with.\u000a So the measurement will be on the bottom and the date is on the side.\u000a Do you guys agree? James? You think that's right? Okay, we'll try it. Go date and then go ahead and type measurement. Should we have a unit on it since we're talking about measurement?\u000a Mhmm. \u000a Okay. So the whole point of--\u000a And what's in row one?\u000a One, four, 13?\u000a Okay, write that. You're gonna put the date there? Will, would you like a turn?\u000a Mhm.\u000a Instead of doing commas, if you're gonna write it like that, you're gonna put a dash in between. I'm gonna have Will, Will type this time. We'll take turns. So type in the date.  Okay, and then what would go here under the? What are you gonna graph? Like what's gonna be the bar graph part?\u000a Six centimeters? No, no, the height was the, another beam.\u000a So type that in.\u000a

V  So our question was: What are the reasons why Holden has a sudden acceptance of letting Phoebe grow up. And I got this question because, I feel like the carousel represents growing up because  you have to let people grab towards something they want or else if you're not letting them experience the world to its full extent then you're just sheltering them and they're just going to live a sheltered life. So they can't really do all the things that they have the possibility of experiencing.\u000a Yeah, I agree with him, with Damon because I think the carousel symbolizes the ride through life. Because it never really stops, just continuously goes around and around. And the goal is to grab the golden hoop. And I think that symbolizes, I don't know, happiness because everybody tries for it and they keep trying even though they fall, they keep getting back up on that carousel and trying to grab it. And if you hold a kid back from trying to grab what he wants, it's just like no, I'm not going to let you go out there and try to get what you want. They're sheltering them from their own happiness, kind of. Because \u000a I also agree with Brandon, but I also think that, let's just say Phoebe was on the carousel and she fell off. I don't know if Holden would go to her, but I think based on his character he would. But then I think that would be bad just because, like Brandon was saying, if you don't let them fall, if you don't let them make their own mistakes then they're not gonna learn from life. So like my dad, he's so overprotective. I think pretty much all parents are really overprotective of their kids, but you should just let them go out there and experience the world and learn from themselves. Not necessarily, because I think that's their fear, learning from their mistakes. So I just think it's better if you just let them go like a little bit at a time just so they can just figure out things in life.\u000a I think people have a hard time letting go of any child, whether it's their brother, their sister, their actual child because it means that they're leaving soon and they're actually going to experience their own lives and then when it comes to a parent or an older brother or sister, they don't want you to experience the same thing that they did too, so they're like telling you what to do and it seems like they're telling you how to live your life, but they're giving you advice.\u000a I think parents, the reason that they're so protective is because they know that saying ignorance is bliss, because it really is, and innocence is in a way, you know, because you don't know. And so they just want their child to be happy but inadvertently they're actually making them sad if they just won't relax so they can \u000a And also, I think a lot of kids don't understand this but part of the reason why our parents have such a hard time letting go is because you were part of their lives for as many years as you've been born. They preciously try to take care of you and they may seem like they're trying to shield you from everything, but they're just trying to look out for what's best for you. But you can't think of it like, oh, once this one chance goes by, I'll never have it again. Because it really is like a carousel. You're gonna keep going on and you will have another chance.\u000a Going back to the carousel I also thought that the carousel, it may just seem that there are a bunch of different people on it. So I think Holden kind of realized that even though the carousel, he knows have different people on it, you kind of have to allow the kids to grow up because you can't always keep them the same like the carousel, it's not a real machine or something. We all have to grow up eventually.\u000a Just listening to you guys, what do you think about, when I was home in Los Angeles, my nephew at that time was about six months old. And at that point in time he was just crawling and putting everything in his mouth and stuff like that, like leaves. You'd show him an apple and he's like, "Ahh." And then he puts a leaf in his mouth. And you're just like, "Holy!" You have to dig it out kind of a thing. So in one respect, I mean, it's just like there's this idea of let people figure out things on their own, but in that respect, he'll die if you let him figure out oh, you can't eat that. So I'm just trying to think as far as a parent goes, how does a parent know when to let them figure it out versus how does a parent when to protect them? And I think that's part of the conflict Holden is having, he's trying to figure out how he can protect people and what he should protect them against.\u000a Me and my grandpa talk to me and he was like, "I know that I have to let you go." And I think that they know when to let you go by how responsible you are. Like if you do what you're supposed to do and you show them that you're working or doing what you said then they want to let you go because they know that you \u000a That's true, and I also think that it's not really based on yourself mostly. It's based on your parents and how they've grown and how with having kids you grow up as a parent and you know and it's just nature, you just know when they're ready. That's what I think. I don't think really it's just based on all of their mistakes. I just think it's pretty much based on \u000a  Interesting.\u000a I think when people start changing and stuff, like their attitude, because I've noticed my little brother, he's starting to change and he has an attitude now. He's starting to get a little rebellious and stuff, and I think that's when parents have to start letting loose on their kids cause we have to experience things on our own, and it's not just being told what to do and stuff. You have to have that experience to learn from.\u000a Every person has their own free will. Like the saying you can take a horse to the water but you can't make it drink. You can enforce your rules on your child as much as you want but you can't force them to do anything, you can just have an influence on them. And that's something that parents have to understand. You can't force your kids to do their homework, but you can ground them if they don't.\u000a All right guys, I want you guys to keep going. You guys are doing a great job. I can see your notes are also looking pretty good. I'm gonna move on to another group, okay? But keep this going because I think you guys can come up with a lot more, okay? Thank you guys. You guys are doing an awesome job with your volume, we're gonna come over to  this group over here.\u000a All right, can you fill me in on what you guys talked about making sure we have the volume up.\u000a We have a couple of questions, we have like - \u000a Oh, okay. Let's just come up with, tell me about the one that you guys are the most excited about.\u000a The first question is my question, which was what are the reasons why people live their lives through other people. And I kind of came up with that question because Holden, he kind of was denied of his childhood because Allie died and so that really impacted him. And since that he's kind of been trying to preserve the innocence of Phoebe. Like making her go back to the carousel even though she says she's too big for it. He's like, "No, you're not." He's trying to help to her keep that innocence, or just children in general keep that innocence that he was denied.\u000a It kind of was a parent versus child kind of thing. It goes against like parent versus child. So a parent when they have a child, they kind of want to live their life through their child. And they make them do all these chores to get into  because they never got to do it when they were little because they were deprived and their parents probably didn't want them to do it. So they kind of .\u000a  Interesting.\u000a I said that I just think this whole concept of the identity is not yet established, and you have the father and have somebody else create their footsteps  I had these two other questions because I was reading the book where I was wondering why, I was trying to get more in depth with why Holden wanted his job to be catching children in the rye.\u000a Okay, so I kind of answered it and I said it's very in tune because when you fall off the cliff you can't get back up. Just like when you lose your innocence, you can't get it back because this experience happened. If you get exposed to it, you can't magically forget it. It just stays with you and that's a part of you that's just lost.\u000a  Interesting.\u000a That kind of relates back to the question about  It seems like Holden is kind of holding onto his past, and so he's still living in that innocent stage, and when he's living an innocent stage he can't make a wrong decision, which is very hard from his now because he's 16, he keeps transferring to all these schools, and he can't really grow up because he still has that memory and so that's why he's confused about his identity.\u000a  Good point.\u000a Going back to the first question about why people live their lives through other people, it kind of goes through influences too. Like he was talking about James Castle, and when he died he said that James liked to digress on a topic and have speeches and it kind of made him think about, oh yeah, that's a pretty great idea. It's not bad, but why would people be waiting for that? It was actually like a digression off topic makes you think of new ideas.\u000a And I think going back to that question again, that sometimes parents want the best for their child, so they convince their, what they want their child to be.  If that makes sense. And at the end, sometimes you can't force the child to do what they don't want to do.\u000a So in a way it's kind of like you guys said, the parent versus the child. They wanna form their own identity as a teen, but at the same time the parents are so busy trying to protect them. Is that what we're kind of getting at through everything? They're so busy trying to protect them that they just gotta learn to let go. Is that what we're saying?\u000a Yeah, kind of. Like Holden says he's trying to protect that innocence, because he's always referring to  There's a part where he's walking down the sidewalk and he called Allie to help him cross to the other side. And that's kind of interesting because usually you don't think an adult would say that. A child would say that. And it's because he's mad at his parents because they won't talk about it, so he's kind of just living with this.\u000a  Interesting. So he's just trying to find a way of coping? Is that possible?\u000a Yes. And then there was another kind of question about where Holden comes to  Kiana said-\u000a Why do people feel the need to forget the deaths and move on? And I thought of this question because when Holden was inside just his room, Phoebe was getting all frustrated with him because she was like, "You don't like anything! You don't like anything!" And he was trying to make up stuff that he did like. Like he did say he liked Allie, and she'll say he's dead so pick something else. And he was arguing with her saying that just because he's dead you don't forget him, and you can still like someone who's dead. And he thinks that Allie is thousand times better than, nicer than, people who are alive today, now. So that just proves how he's holding on to that and he's not planning on forgetting that, and he holds that near and dear to his heart. And so that's probably why he doesn't like a lot of people, because he compares them to how Allie was and his innocence, his maturity level, how it was then, and how he sees how people today, because kids don't understand he's holding on, so he doesn't really understand what's going on.\u000a  Anything else to add on to this?\u000a No.\u000a  I like what you guys are doing. I like how you're tying in the death of Allie with the catcher in the rye type of a thing. What about the carousel, first of all?\u000a I don't know, it sounds like it goes with the whole keeping the innocence going and all. 'Cause I know he would probably ride it too. Did he ride it?\u000a I was thinking of repetition, because how the parents feel, it rotates around and round. And whenever Phoebe passed by, he would tell her how pretty she looked. She was never changing. That's kind of what he wanted, he wanted her to stay in that stage, and nothing to change.\u000a  Nice. All right, guys. I'm gonna check on another group. I want you guys to keep going with this, you guys are tearing it apart. Good job looking at the symbolism and tying everything together. All right, and your notes look good as well too. I like it. I think you guys could explore the carousel and tie that in a little more. Okay, hi guys! You guys, the volume is doing really well.  So you guys fill me in.\u000a Okay.\u000a  Tell me what you guys talked about.\u000a Just mostly like  and symbolism in the book.\u000a  Start getting louder.\u000a

V Just take it in, but take your tube off first. Before you pull it out, before you pull the needle out, take your vacutainer tube off, and this is...\u000a Pull it out again?\u000a Yeah. Use your two by two remember.\u000a Oh, yeah.\u000a There you go. Good job, Faye. And, guys, it just takes a while. This is not something you're going to learn overnight. This is a skill that it takes a little while to learn. You've got to get hand movements down, you've got to figure out what works best for you. You know, if you need things placed in a different position. But after this, you all can start sticking the arms when you're not doing your book work. Then, whenever you feel like you got all your hand movements down, you feel like you're proficient, then I'll watch you, which I'll watch you doing, then you all will stick me. So what do you think, Cassie?\u000a Hmm?\u000a What do you think? Is it easier than you thought, or harder than you thought?\u000a Easier.\u000a Yay, Faye. Those arms are a little harder to get... Those veins are not as easy to feel as...\u000a That's okay. She's doing a fine job. Two by two.\u000a Sorry. You  to draw blood from them.\u000a Pop your tourniquet. Engage your safety. Good job. From down there?\u000a Yeah.\u000a They say not to use these, and you can use hand veins, but remember, first choice, second choice, last choice, and then hand veins. If you're going to do hand veins, you all have been through a lot of the book work already, if you're going to use hand veins, what kind of needle are you going to use?\u000a Butterfly.\u000a Butterfly. Okay I know you all have seen them use butterfly in the clinic. You guys will actually rotate through the clinic lab. We'll do it at Dr. Maderis' clinic, so that you all can get more sticks there.\u000a Is there some people who draw only from around here?\u000a Not usually. Now, there are some people, they'll come in and they'll say, "You can't get blood from anywhere from me except here." What that one lady told you, is right here, right...\u000a I'm better at popping it out. Remember I couldn't get it in.\u000a Good. It will be something that, after you get these hand movements down, it'll just happen. Because when I'm not talking while I'm doing it, I mean, it just flows. Because I have done it for several years, but for some reason after you get older, it's hard to talk and do something at the same time.\u000a,  That's what we're going to do today, is you all are going to learn how to draw blood. You're going to learn how to actually stick the fake arms that we have or the phlebotomy learning aids is actually what they're called. And each one of you have gotten to a certain point in either phlebotomy or medical assisting where you're ready to start drawing blood. And I know that Wanda has gotten a little further but it never hurts to refresh on the procedures because, guys, when you get out there in the clinical area, a lot of people don't follow a lot of the steps that you need to do as far as blood draws. Guys that are medical assisting, you are not going to have to do as many venipunctures and the phlebotomy students but you may be responsible for drawing blood in a doctor's office. When you're there in the doctor's office it's just you and the person. So you quickly develop really good phlebotomy skills because if you don't get it then you have to send them to outpatient hospital to be able to get that blood drawn. The first things I want to talk about is your vein choice. And I printed off your veins. And the median cubital is your vein of choice and the median cubital runs right here in the middle.\u000a  You can see this one better.\u000a Yeah, you see that one better. Your median cubital runs right in the middle and then your basilic is the one you want to stay away from. That's the one that runs little finger side. And then your cephalic is on the thumb side. So this little finger side toward the inside of the elbow is the one you really want to stay away from. And the reason that this is your last choice vein is there's quite a few nerves that are right underneath it. So if you go too deep or you move the needle around too much you can actually cause nerve damage. And I will leave this on the table as y'all are practicing with your phlebotomy arms so that you can look at your vein choice. Nerve damage is a very real possibility and some nerve damage is permanent so be very careful when you're choosing your vein. You can only advance or withdraw the needle only. You cannot go sideways. I know those of you who's already been in the clinical site, you've seen them go sideways, you've seen them come out and go back in. And guys, that could be a liability for you, and you're the only one that can protect your patient and you. I've got the materials set up. Whenever we repeat this, you all will set your materials up so take notice of what we've got here because you'll need this every time you practice on the phlebotomy arms. When you go to clean your arm, you're going to clean in a circular motion. So I'm going to go ahead and get started. First thing you're going to do, I don't need your gloves, just the two hands. First thing you're going to do is put on your gloves. I just washed my hands but I'm going to put on my gloves. And why do I want to do that? Jim.\u000a  So I don't get infected.\u000a Yeah, I don't want to come into contact with someone's blood. Now, who could protect me from coming into contact with someone's blood?\u000a Yourself.\u000a I'm the only one that can do that. And I can tell you, from having my blood drawn, people have drawn my blood without gloves on though they didn't know me from Adam. And one person in particular got quite a bit of my blood on them. So I am the only one that can protect me. If I see you practicing without your gloves on, it is an automatic grade ding for that practice day. If I see you drawing in the clinical area without gloves on, then we're going to have a big talk, okay? Because you've got to protect you.\u000a  I have a question. With some people that you draw blood on, do you have to wear a mask? Like an eyeshield-type thing.\u000a If they are on precautions then yes, you would. And you've seen, at the hospital, on the doors where they have contact and respiratory isolation. If you were to go into one of those rooms, yes you would. In the ER, when you draw blood, you usually have on that splash mask. Now usually, with a venipuncture, you're not going to have that much pressure. It's not going to shoot the blood back out at you like an arterial would, but still, it's better to err on the side of safety. But also, if there's nothing wrong with me except I need a CBC to have a surgery and you come at me with a mask and a shield, I'm going to think, "Oh my gosh. Why is she doing that?" You know? So make sure that it's appropriate. If you're in a trauma area then yes, definitely. If you're in an outpatient clinic, unless that patient tells you, "My veins squirt blood really bad." A patient will tell you. One time I was doing a finger stick and it squirted and I had on my glasses but I turned my head. It hit me in the hair. So sometimes the venous flow will do that. Good question, Cathy. All right, so got my gloves on, first I'm going to do is I'm going to put the tourniquet on. And guys, the tourniquet can be kind of tricky the first time or two you do it. And you're going to put it underneath the arm. You need to make sure it's tight so your vein will pop up but not so tight you're going to cut off the blood flow and not so tight you're going to cause petechiae, which is little red patches on the arm. I'm going to cross my hands over. What I do is I put my left hand in position, I take my right hand, get ahold of the tail of this, pull it, and then I stick it underneath with my little finger. You always want your tails up toward the top so they're not in your area where you're going to clean and draw. When I'm going to clean... well, let me show you how to feel first. Well, it's not going to cooperate today.\u000a You can use my arm. That way they can see better.\u000a Can you move the Sharps container?\u000a I'm going to stick it underneath there. And now it should stay on there. Now to locate a vein, I'm going to take my index finger and I'm going to feel back and forth. And guys, you all can do this on each other. Jim's excellent to feel veins on and he's a real good volunteer. Bounce back and forth. It feels like a gummy worm or something soft underneath there. If it feels really hard, like I have one that I'll let you all feel that is very sclerotic or hard, you're not going to get blood out of it. It's got to be... it's got to bounce. So when you go across and you find it, then you're going to find which way it travels. So you're going to go up it and down it so you know which way to put your needle in. Some veins will go off to the side and some remain very straight. So I found my vein. Now the tourniquet can only stay on for one minute. Has my tourniquet been on about a minute? Probably so, so I need to take the tourniquet off, give this patient's arm a rest, and then I can talk to them about the weather, I can go ahead and line up my tubes at that time, and then I'm ready to draw blood now. So I come in here, I put my tourniquet on, and guys, when you put this tourniquet on you got to be ready to go because you only have one minute. And I'm going to clean. I'm going to clean in a circular motion and then, if you're having trouble with the alcohol, you're not able to fan it, you can't blow on it, and you can take one very clean 2 by 2, go straight down, dry it off, and then... many of you already did that. This part of the needle, this part with the rubber on it has the needle on it. You screw that in, take the end off, this is a safety needle. You anchor and then you stick in the bevel of the needle, that is the pointy part, the bevel goes up and then the pointy part goes into the skin. I pull my thumb away as I'm going in. I take one of these Vacutainer tubes, thank you, Jim, and I push it in. And guys, when I push in with my thumb I'm pulling back with my fingers. And you're not able to see but there is... and I don't do this in the clinical side, but there is blood coming in there. You let it fill until it stops. Now it's stopped flowing. I'm going to wrap my fingers around it and push because the more still you keep the needle, the less it's going to hurt the patient. Pop my tourniquet and I'm going to take a different 2 by 2 than what I cleaned with. Fold it, lay it on the arm, and guys, I'm just going to kind of hover there until I bring the needle out and push down. If I push down while the needle is in the arm, it hurts really bad. And I'm going to hold here and I'm going to hold until it quits bleeding. And you can peek. Now if the blood... oh, sticky needle engaged. It's hard to talk and do stuff at the same time, isn't it? Sharps. And you toss that in the sharps. Now, if this patient is on blood thinners, I've got to hold longer. A lot of clinics will just put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there, put a CoBand on them and send them on their way. If they bleed out outside of the lab, you're liable. And again, you're the only one that can protect you. So I make sure that they've stopped bleeding. And now how hard is that going to be when there is a lobby full? You guys have been observing.\u000a Can we ask them to hold it?\u000a Well, you can. But what if they don't hold it tight enough? What if there's a whole lobby full? Jim, what have you seen them do in the past?\u000a  and check.\u000a Yeah. You need to check it. If there's a whole lobby full sitting out there then you'll get to them when you get to them, because you've got to protect your phlebotomy certificate. You're the only that can do that. A lot of places, they will put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there, tell the patient to hold their arm up. That breaks platelets, that's going to make a huge bruise, and it doesn't really help with the clotting that much, just kind of bruises. So we're going to look here. Okay, this patient has quit bleeding, so I am good to go here. Now, another lesson I will teach you about writing on the vials, the blood draw vials and what information needs to be on there. So before you all draw, let me ask you a few questions. What's your first choice vein?\u000a Median.\u000a Median. Okay. And why do we avoid the basilic? Nicole.\u000a  Nerves and tendons.\u000a Nerves. Okay. What can happen if I... powder on the shirt. What can happen if I dig around in there and I do injure somebody? What can they do?\u000a They can bleed or they can have their nerve damage.\u000a Right. And they can come and say, "This phlebotomist drew here." And then, guys, if you're ever in a setting where you have to go to court, they're going to call somebody that's a phlebotomist like you are and they're going to ask them, "What's your first choice vein?" And they're going to say, "The median, " and they're going to say, "What's your next choice? What's your last choice?" So you're going to have somebody there that knows. You really don't want to draw from that one unless it is your last choice. Okay, what can happen if the patient's on blood thinners? Cassie, what's the most important thing to remember about the patient that's on blood thinners?\u000a  To keep pressure.\u000a To keep pressure. Okay. How do you clean your site, Martika?\u000a  In a circular outward motion.\u000a Circular, you don't ever go back over. And how long do you leave the tourniquet on, Faye?\u000a  One minute.\u000a One minute. Good job. Okay. You all get your... First thing you do is what?\u000a Gloves.\u000a Get your gloves on. So you all are going to draw.\u000a With drawing blood, are you supposed to record where you drew at and everything just like a nurse is supposed to?\u000a I would if I were you, because that just protects you. So you can write median. You can write an MC, median cubital, and that way you may... actually you could put it on where you put your initials where you draw. And that way they know that you drew from the median. That you didn't draw from basilic.\u000a I need another needle.\u000a Okay.  Anybody else need another needle?\u000a Thank you.\u000a You're welcome. I'm going to send tourniquets home with you all and you can practice on everybody. Feel their veins, feel all the different types of veins. Some people have garden hoses is what I call them. Some people have very large veins. And feel for your vein.\u000a The tourniquet pinched my thumb.\u000a The gloves are hard to... you trading them out? It's this arm, Jim, I think because I had trouble getting it.\u000a When I was doing it, too.\u000a Okay. Just make it a little tighter with your...\u000a Oh.\u000a Did you stick yourself?\u000a Mm-mm.\u000a Okay.\u000a I screwed the wrong part.\u000a I think she's bleeding and I haven't even done anything yet.\u000a Oh, yeah hand me another one.\u000a There it goes again.\u000a Okay, Casey. Let me see what I can do for you. Good job, Martika.\u000a Want to just chill, how's the weather, blah, blah, blah, blah.\u000a Is it not come undone now? You might want to pull your tail, just pull it in there with one of the smaller tails. It'll stay down.\u000a Okay.\u000a It's moving again.\u000a You're kidding.\u000a See?\u000a Okay. Just keep going.\u000a Okay.\u000a Just keep going. It's easier on a person. That's my stomach, Jim. It's hungry. Sorry.\u000a  Yeah, this one... Jim knows which ones stay better. Okay, you got to anchor your vein with your non-dominant... with your non-dominant hand you anchor your vein. I have to stand. I can't... see, you take your thumb and you pull down here. Anchor your vein. There you go. Casey, are you left-handed, too?\u000a Mm-mm. I thought you said non-dominant hand.\u000a Non-dominant hand to anchor. Back it out. Put it in this hand. Are you right-handed?\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a Put non-dominant hand thumb there, anchor.\u000a Okay.\u000a Now, did you clean it?\u000a Yep.\u000a Okay. Then go in.\u000a Uh-oh.\u000a It's okay.\u000a It's okay. \u000a Well, that's okay. Put that on.\u000a Start over.\u000a A lot of this is hand movement. A lot of this is prac--\u000a

V I don't want a straight line.\u000a No.\u000a I like curves.\u000a Yeah, a lot.\u000a Because the friction in the air--\u000a Yeah.\u000a Pushes it, and the gravity  going on the next turn.\u000a I think it's because there's like a big wall, and that's a small little plane, and everything has gravity.\u000a You need to pull on the string. \u000a And, the reason why it's not going that way is because that wall will stray them away.\u000a The wings get cool.\u000a What was your longest throw? How long was it?\u000a Oh, it was-- \u000a It was mine, and it was probably one, two, three, four, five, six. Five-\u000a No, it's six.\u000a One, two, three, four, five, six.\u000a Into the six, but not before the six.\u000a Oh yes, into the six.\u000a Alright. Go over there, check that out.\u000a 38.\u000a Four hundred--\u000a 538 centimeters.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Let's put how many meters. Five meters.\u000a Write 538.\u000a But, why did, because fliers don't go into the wall.\u000a Because ... Everything has a little bit of gravity. There's not a whole lot of gravity where it would just go .\u000a Yeah, and then that doesn't have a lot of gravity, but I mean--\u000a I can see that, but he threw it high and it went up to the wall right there. \u000a But, it kind of did like that.\u000a But, it didn't really smash.\u000a I mean, it didn't go and stick.\u000a Yeah, it didn't go. Gravity pulled it, but it wasn't going to hold it there.\u000a Yeah. \u000a It's got more force on it.\u000a Yeah, I think there's more gravity up there than right here because that's higher, and it's closer. It's like, it has a lot more gravity.\u000a What has more gravity?\u000a  Up there. \u000a Had more pull?\u000a I think the reason why the sticks were going and the straw was going this way is because everything has a little bit of gravity--\u000a And, the wall!\u000a And, the wall, it like, a lot bigger than that stick, and it's gravity that's pulling it there, but it doesn't have enough gravity where it will just be like--\u000a It's not like this!\u000a Okay, so if everything has a little bit of gravity, what is the major gravity pull, though, that is bringing it down?\u000a The Earth.\u000a The Earth, because--  That's why, like if we threw this, that's why--  \u000a That's why it chops.\u000a Okay, this one went, it went three meters,  This one covered straw with paper and this one glides.\u000a It's a lot bigger.\u000a So, when it went like here, it went all the way down to the .\u000a Yeah, it's faster because it's bigger and this one's smaller and it doesn't go far.\u000a Glider, the other one's probably bigger. \u000a This one's also flat so it's got a better chance to glide.\u000a Yeah. That one's like round and bigger, and it doesn't flop on the, and it doesn't go, like, far. When you throw it, it doesn't, like, when it goes it doesn't go far, but this one, like, it'll go far.\u000a What do you think would happen if we put a paperclip on either the front or the back?\u000a It would help--\u000a It would lay it a little bit down--\u000a It would go a little bit down, because it's, it has more weight, it'll go down.\u000a If you put a paperclip on it, like a paperclip's not that heavy, but it would make it, like, when we fly it, it goes up in the air, and then comes back down and floats down. That's why they're so short.\u000a What makes it come down?\u000a Gravity.\u000a Okay.\u000a And, like you put a paperclip on it, it'll come down. Because the paperclip is heavier than the straw.\u000a What if you put it on the back?\u000a It would, it would ...\u000a It would kind of slow it. It would be like that .\u000a Okay, can you think of? What about this one? What if we put the paperclip on this one?\u000a It would--\u000a It wouldn't feel. It would get worse.\u000a If we put the paperclip on here, then it would get all messed up because if it's flat and it's trying to . It has weight, it will just go.\u000a Uh-huh, right. That one, when you fly it, before we got the paperclip, it goes high before it comes down. But, when we put the paperclip on it, it goes straight down, like that. And, like without the paperclip, without the paperclip on it, it will go like, it will go like an ocean.  With the paperclip on there, it would go farther. It would go farther and then it'll fall just down like that, but not go like that.\u000a This one, let's try this one!\u000a See, that one goes a lot farther.\u000a And, it probably goes farther because I put a lot of force on it. If you even put a lot of force on this one, it will go down because it flies like, I threw it like that, and it just flies off, because it's the gravity. And you throw that one, it goes farther.\u000a Okay, so gravity makes it come down faster than the glider?\u000a It makes it go down, because if you just throw it without the paperclip, it won't, it will just come down because of gravity. _ Yeah, the straw one is going like that. And then it just goes like, see how it flips down? But, with the paperclip, it'll go farther.\u000a Like that.\u000a Tyler, what were you saying about the air? Do you think that has a, do you think that makes a difference in what Mary Morgan is saying this one kind of floats and then comes down? Go talk about that.\u000a See, the air--\u000a The air feels like windy in here.\u000a It would push it, and then it would--\u000a It would go like this.\u000a Yeah, like that. And, it would just push. It would just push it towards like where everything was.\u000a Yeah, and this one with the paperclip goes really far.\u000a And, that paperclip, the reason it went far without the paperclip is because air pushed it and force.\u000a What is that force called? When you push it?  Remember, it's called--\u000a The thrust.\u000a The thrust, that's right. So the thrust, when you push the plane, made a difference, is that what you said?  Could you change the one with the straw, is there any changes that you could make that you think would make it fly further? Talk about that as a group.\u000a Put two paperclips.\u000a One on the front and one on the back.\u000a Put the lighter one on the back. Let's try that. I bet it will- It might go farther too. Okay, now push.\u000a We have a paperclip on it, and we're going to see if it goes farther the second time. I think, I bet it will go, I bet it goes a lot longer.\u000a That's fine. \u000a Well ... It went to 10!\u000a It went to 10. \u000a Okay, so I want you to discuss in this group, I want you to discuss what you found when you threw, when you tested this with the paperclip on it. Just talk about that together.\u000a Well, .\u000a So when there's air, I think when they closed the air up, it went in and back out. But, but, but, tied together .\u000a So, if you like flip off--\u000a The paper clip.\u000a The air, like if you could do this, and turn off the air, it would go further.\u000a But, if you take off of it, I mean if you, it won't make it that far. It will just be like .\u000a The paper clip, the straw, it does help.\u000a Yeah, about the same as this one without.\u000a I wonder what that one's like with paperclips.\u000a Me too.\u000a I want to try it.\u000a This is my prediction. I think it's on an angle--\u000a I think that's going to go further.\u000a I don't know, because they don't have no air stream to hold it. \u000a I think it will go farther.\u000a I don't.\u000a See?\u000a Well, you didn't put a lot of force on that one. Well, we all have to try.\u000a But, I still think it went the farthest, but I think .\u000a I think it's going to go farther.\u000a Nope.\u000a Well, it went farther than you.\u000a It went\u000a But, I mean, it didn't go--\u000a You all tried it with this didn't you all? Let me try it this way.\u000a I tried it with that, I tried it with that side.\u000a It all went to the yellow, but--\u000a But, it didn't--\u000a Strong enough.\u000a So, what did we find out back here?\u000a That it puts more weight on it so it goes.\u000a What puts more weight?\u000a This little paperclip. The paperclip puts more weight to that one, and it's not going to nose dive. But I was standing right here and mine hit that wall. And, that's without the paperclip. And, then you put the paperclip on there, it doesn't go near as far.\u000a Why did that make a difference? Was your throws the same? Did you use the same amount of force? What happened?\u000a Mine felt like I was using the same force. I think it's just because that, since there isn't any air space on that one--\u000a What do you mean airspace?\u000a I mean like, the air can't go through this.\u000a Yeah, like that's a straw, it has a hole.\u000a It's just putting more weight on that one, so that's just going to go boop. If you use this one, and put the paperclip right here, it's going to cut off the air coming in right here. And, that's going to go further.\u000a Oh, you're took off the air of the straw. And that makes it go further. \u000a Why does that?\u000a Because the air in the straw is pulling it down because it's like...\u000a Do you know what that's called?\u000a Gravity.\u000a Well, the gravity, but what about the air when the air is coming in?\u000a Friction!\u000a Oh, friction!\u000a Friction, the air is causing friction? Okay.\u000a The air's slowing it down.\u000a And, also the air. Okay, now I want you to think about if you change this plane in any way, what changes could you make to it to make it fly further?\u000a We could cut it up! \u000a Wrap around, and then have that like this.\u000a Yeah, I think that's set to have the same throw. Because, actually having-- \u000a That one can go farther, but the paperclips on it, it won't fly further. But, if you put paperclips on this one, it'd probably go farther. Put some paperclips on there.\u000a Because paperclips add more weight.\u000a Yeah, and it lets it go further.\u000a Here, Tyler, you want to throw?\u000a That went two.\u000a

V We gotta work quiet. \u000a It's three and a half inches long, and is it? Seven centimeters.\u000a Keep going, gotta keep going.\u000a Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\u000a It's probably about one pound. \u000a Okay, yeah let's go.\u000a I don't know how...\u000a You measure it with this, inches then centimeters.\u000a One inch.\u000a That's one inch.\u000a One inch.\u000a Yeah, then do it across.\u000a We need one inch, one and a half.\u000a One and a half.\u000a Three and a half.\u000a You got it.\u000a It's a bone, got a bone.\u000a Pick it up.\u000a It'd be easier if we could pick it up.\u000a Here's a bone.\u000a There's one yeah.\u000a You all, let's put it in the middle.\u000a We gotta tear it apart now.\u000a We don't have to tear it apart even more.\u000a It's a bone. It's part of that.\u000a Wait, hold on, hold on.\u000a  and feathers.\u000a You all start pulling those ones.\u000a It's on my finger!\u000a There's a ball.\u000a It's a bird, it's a bird.\u000a No, look at this claw.\u000a It's a bird, it's a bird.\u000a It's a birdy bird.\u000a Look, there's its, wait where's its?\u000a There's its teeth and there's its--\u000a It's a skull.\u000a You all be careful with those little ones.\u000a Just broke it.\u000a Oh my god, I found something. \u000a You guys are being mean. \u000a A skull.\u000a I found a skull right there. \u000a How many skulls did you all predict would be in your owl pellet?\u000a I put one.\u000a One? How many have you found so far? Was it right?\u000a We found a couple bones.\u000a What about skulls, how many skulls?\u000a It's tiny. Alright, how can you determine what kind of animal it is? How much did it weigh?\u000a Ten grams.\u000a Ten grams. Do you think, do you think its weight has anything to do with how many skulls inside? Why would that have anything to do with...\u000a Because the skull might weigh about two grams maybe.\u000a I think here's another skull. It's got a lot of bones in it.\u000a Okay, see if you can determine what animal it is.\u000a Looks kind of like a teacup.\u000a This is a rat skull because I can see its teeth right here.\u000a I know, Jake found another skull I think.\u000a This is a skull.\u000a This is so cool.\u000a Let's get playing boys and girls.\u000a You all, I think this is what we got.\u000a No, that is a bone.\u000a No look, look. Where's the claw? And look at this claw. I think it's the same.\u000a And then look.\u000a Look, let's see.\u000a Oh, that's a skeleton.\u000a Oh, that is a skeleton.\u000a Ooh, my touching it.\u000a A whale,.\u000a Ooh yay, we found a skeleton. Look at the skeleton Chloe.\u000a It's a skull. It's a skull.\u000a Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.\u000a Put the feathers and stuff over here.\u000a Or whatever it is.\u000a Yeah, we need to  the feathers.\u000a Look, this is soft.\u000a It's not soft, it has something.\u000a There's a little baby bone.\u000a It looks like a squirrel.\u000a Look, I got a baby bone.\u000a No, seriously.\u000a What animal did you predict you would find in your owl pellet?\u000a A bird. A bird, a gopher and a rat.\u000a So what have you, have you decided what it is?\u000a A bird.\u000a How did you determine it was a bird?\u000a We found like big claws like this.\u000a How can you be sure that it's a bird claw?\u000a Because these are usually as hard and like sharper. \u000a We put this.\u000a Oh, we got the skull and we got a skull.\u000a How many animals, how many skulls have you found?\u000a We only found like two. This is what I was thinking. You know how it has sharp stuff up there?\u000a What's a way that you can determine what it is?\u000a I think we got a bird, we got some more claws.\u000a However much bones you find...\u000a Compare the bones that you found to the bones on the chart?\u000a I found another skeleton.\u000a Keep working.\u000a It has to be a bone, this might be something right there.\u000a Let me get that out, because I haven't got anything out yet.\u000a We got two skulls.\u000a I found something, I found this.\u000a Another skull.\u000a Yeah, I think.\u000a Found another bone.\u000a You did?\u000a Yep.\u000a We found all sorts of, here's another, this  is a claw.\u000a It's a bird.\u000a Is this a bird claw or, I don't know.\u000a I think that's a...\u000a Where's the bird skull?\u000a Found something.\u000a What is it?\u000a Wait, hold on, wait.\u000a I think we'll find another skull.\u000a What do you think this is Daniel? What do you think this is?\u000a I don't know.\u000a Know what that is?\u000a I bet that's probably something.\u000a I think this bone might be something found in its arm.\u000a You all, look what I found.\u000a I think this is a skull right here because...\u000a We got them two, don't worry.\u000a We got a bone, we got a bone.\u000a We got the same skeleton.\u000a Have you determined what your animal is?\u000a No, we don't know.\u000a I think this is an eyeball.\u000a We got a bunch of eyeballs.\u000a Here, let me see that.\u000a Look, look, look.\u000a It's a tooth.\u000a Eyeball.\u000a Let me see.\u000a Look, I found this. \u000a This is the  part of the eyeball.\u000a Look, look, I found the--\u000a Ew!\u000a I found the pelvis! I found the pelvis. \u000a The owls are on this chart. \u000a I think that might be something, wait. \u000a With the tweezers.\u000a Here's an eye socket.\u000a Over there somewhere.\u000a This is this I think.\u000a We need to get the hair out of it.\u000a Oh my word. I think we got...\u000a Look, I got the head.\u000a See how sharp these are? \u000a

So I'll come back here in a minute, I'm gonna tend to this table.  What, okay, what is? I don't know what I would there. 'Cause they have the, what is the all right, what is, and what is.  You guys, it should say what is the slope, okay. It should say what is the slope.\u000a It represents the y-intercept. Yeah, it said what is the . \u000a That's what I'm saying.  people.\u000a All right, I'm just sayin' it would .\u000a Okay, three. Can I have your attention real quick please. All right, once you find, I see most of you have yours in point slope would you also put it in slope intercept, okay? Because that'll help you with question number three, okay then I've got through question number three. Go 'head and find your answer and .  Here we have, what is this?\u000a Linear.\u000a Okay, is that a line?\u000a No.\u000a Okay. Were you supposed to draw a line through it? \u000a Okay, what does it say down there?  Okay, why you did number five before you did number one, it said draw a line through, right? This is like a, not a line, okay? A line is straight, so you wanna draw a line straight through there. But, before you do that, I want you to answer and do one, two, three and four first.\u000a Should we erase this?\u000a Uh yeah, but don't worry about it right now, I want you to work on finding a, what two points did you have?\u000a Um, .\u000a Okay, and why did you get that?\u000a Because .\u000a What's easy mean?\u000a Like one plus one. \u000a And what kind of slope did you get? Oh, you haven't done it yet? Okay, I'll get back to you, all right?\u000a But 72's .\u000a What's number two? What is the slope.\u000a What is the slope value.\u000a What is the slope. What is the slope. And then I was gonna, I actually had started out with what doesn't, mean in a situation, . \u000a But when you .\u000a Y equals one and x, yep, okay y = 1x. Now, how do we find, what's the ordered pair here? \u000a Okay, that's the slope intercept form.\u000a Oh, that's what, got 'em mixed up.\u000a So what is it though? And you don't have point slope. What is the ordered pair for y-intercept?\u000a Is that the one where you have parentheses with two n and then another one that's like--\u000a No, that's point slope. Okay, I just want the y-intercept. Okay, .2 is the y-intercept in this equation. y = mx+b.  Right, it's two. What did that tell me?  That's what the y-intercept is. What does it represent, the situation .  Okay, now wait, it's-- \u000a Okay, is it for two people? So  is for people? Okay, now if you were to look at your graph, which we haven't done yet. And where would negative two cross? Though I'm not sure that's . \u000a Now I'm also seeing something here about, . Why do you have a two here?\u000a Hello! \u000a So 30, 32.\u000a I know, right?\u000a Making me erase! \u000a That's okay.\u000a So it's three, six, nine, 12, then all this other junk?\u000a So you can get up there and get 33.  Always thinkin'.\u000a Six is six, eight is eight.\u000a I'm sorry. \u000a Three seconds. For every, how many people? For each person, three seconds a person. Okay, no that's  person, according to... your data. So it took three seconds to pass from the church, right? Now, what is minus 24 ? \u000a Okay, that's a year, you have y-intercept is negative 24, and it represents?  Okay, I want you to do one  graph. \u000a Okay yeah, whatever your Y is starting at. By the way, this is a . They want you to draw a line . Okay so, what is ?  Time in seconds, right? Where does the y intercept?  It crosses x, okay? It crosses x. The y-intercept crosses.  The y-intercept crosses y. Okay, the y-intercept crosses the y. \u000a Okay, so y is gonna cross the axes that is talking about what?  Okay? All right?  It's crossing, talking about time, okay? \u000a It's supposed to say what is the slope, the slope is wards for s.\u000a You should move your line so that it follows the dots. Okay, I'm gonna come back here. What's the problem?\u000a Time, .\u000a They're confusing me.\u000a All right, so number three, you said the y-intercept is six-elevenths of a second, is that what you're saying? Six-elevenths seconds? Okay, and you said that was what?  Okay.  All right, what were the people doing? People were passing books. So six-elevenths, okay, means that it took six-elevenths, were no people ? What was happening during--\u000a Each person to pass .\u000a So was each person passing the book at six-elevenths?\u000a That's how long it took for them to start passing.  Six elevenths of a second.\u000a Okay. So, who passed the first globe. I mean, who's was that?\u000a Angela.\u000a Okay, so he did what?\u000a He had to run around, and then to come back. And here and turn, a person.\u000a Right. He had to leave his desk . Okay now, is that an average throw? Okay, what's your average that you're talking about?\u000a 14 seconds for every 11 men.\u000a Okay, so we might wanna just change that to a decimal, okay? So, just find out how many for one person. Just change it to a decimal. And you might wanna change six-elevenths to a decimal so you can have an actual  Okay? That's great, all right. That's okay, does everybody understand what Jade was saying?\u000a I think the reason why she did that was because .\u000a We had to make a line.\u000a Okay now, . Okay, that doesn't mean make a line graph, .\u000a Oh!\u000a Okay. Are you ?  Drawing a straight line, a straight line. Now we just wanna look at what you got here. Okay, what did you put .\u000a One.\u000a One? And what does it mean?\u000a I got 1.27672767.\u000a Okay, and what does the slope on the line? Now don't worry about your line right now, just answer these questions. What does the slope on the line, your slope of one, represent in this situation?\u000a One second per pass?\u000a Okay, all right, you're gonna do one second per pass.\u000a Averaged--\u000a Per--\u000a Person.\u000a One second per person to pass the book. Get back, right? Okay. So what does your y-intercept represent?\u000a If it's at zero with no passage, that's what the seconds are, that's what the point is.\u000a Okay, say that again?\u000a If there's no passes, like the time starts at negative two seconds, I guess. I don't know how to explain.\u000a Did you get a negative?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Now, is that possible?\u000a No.\u000a No? Okay. Why might you have a negative? \u000a Sometimes it drops.\u000a Okay, but, if you have negative time, okay, can you? \u000a  She'd be like, oh yeah that was negative three seconds ago.\u000a Yeah, negative no, that was three seconds ago, but it wasn't, so you got a  point two, right, seconds. All right? Now, let's just think about, and you said it was what, negative two seconds, but . He wrote people. Okay, when was there a time when there was zero people?  \u000a  I mean in this situation during the book pass! When was there zero time?\u000a Never.\u000a When it's .\u000a When, okay. When they start moving, but somebody was moving.\u000a I think it's zero passes.\u000a No, all right, what does your y line represent?\u000a Time in seconds.\u000a Time in seconds.  So the y-intercept rounded out, that's what? Time in seconds, right? So it's a time, when was time when the books were not being passed?  Somebody had to all right, walk over and, pick 'em up, and then somebody had to walk over and put them.\u000a

V Two times two--\u000a Aggregating rules, smaller the denominator, the bigger the fraction.\u000a That don't work sometimes.\u000a I know what you're thinking.\u000a Six eighths, okay.\u000a One, two, three.\u000a Hey, look.\u000a Four, five, six.\u000a You know it's like division, too.\u000a Yeah, that's--\u000a Okay, six eighths?\u000a Versus what? Six eighths versus three fourths?\u000a Okay.\u000a One, two, three, four, five, six.\u000a They're equal, they're equal.\u000a One, two, three.\u000a They're equal.\u000a I just did that.\u000a They're equal.\u000a Wait, wait, wait. Wait.\u000a That's what I said, didn't you hear me say that? I said if you do equivalent fraciton--\u000a It is.\u000a Divide by two.\u000a Can we do it the easy way?\u000a Nah, cause this is basically the easy way, I mean, look--\u000a Okay, what if we didn't have tiles?\u000a What if we didn't have--\u000a Imagine if we didn't have tiles. We'd have paper and pen. People back in the days, they never had colorful--\u000a They didn't have a pencil, neither.\u000a Oh, yeah, well, you know what I'm talking about.\u000a They had clay and a pointy stick.\u000a All right, so, where's the paper? You guys want to use a pen or pencil?\u000a I already got one.\u000a So, who wants to go first?\u000a I'll go first. I will. Okay, group members. \u000a I can't really explain it.\u000a You can't really explain it? Then show me. If I said, "four tenths" and "one third." Okay, so then how do you know that four tenths is bigger than one third, looking at those fraction bars?\u000a Because you add this and minus this. It's... It's one more than you need.\u000a No, because if you add one tenth to one third, it's still going to be bigger.\u000a Oh, yeah.\u000a All right, but just looking at these two. If I said "one third and four tenths," which one's bigger?\u000a Four tenths.\u000a Four tenths.  How do you know by looking at them?\u000a Because... Three, four. Like, six.\u000a Four tenths. It's wider than one third.\u000a Good, it's wider than one third. So now you guys just finished envelope number two, and you guys have a couple questions to answer about envelope number two. Who's turn is it to write?\u000a Kayla.\u000a Kayla's? So, why don't you read the group question for envelope number two?\u000a Without using the fraction tiles, how could you explain to someone why five twelfths is smaller than one half? How could you explain it to them that five eighths is bigger than one half?\u000a So, what about that question? How would you explain to someone that five twelfths is smaller than one half?\u000a Just like we told you, it's because twelve, well, twelve six is half of...\u000a Six twelve.\u000a Yeah, six twelve. Is half of a twelve. And five is just a little bit smaller than six twelfths.\u000a Okay, very good. What about, what about five eighths is bigger than one half? Israel, what do you think? How would you explain to someone why five eighths is bigger than one half?\u000a Five eighths?\u000a Yeah.  How could you explain to someone that five eighths is bigger than one half, this question right here? How would you explain to someone that five eighths is bigger than one half?\u000a Because like more eighths, one eighth, is bigger than like one, and like, more it adds one half, and one half--\u000a So, what number would eight as a denominator would be exactly one half?\u000a Huh?\u000a Which number, which fraction, with eight as the denominator, would be equal to one half?\u000a Four eighths.\u000a Why do you say four eighths?\u000a It's one half.\u000a Can you show me with the fraction tiles?\u000a Didn't you say not to use the fraction tiles?\u000a I know, but I want him to see that he's right, that four eighths is equal to one half. Okay, guys, okay, good. So, then, how would you explain to somebody why five eighths is bigger than one half?\u000a It's one more, one more you add to it.\u000a You know that one eighths is equal to one half, because they're like even numbers?\u000a One eighth is equal to one half?\u000a Four eighths, four eighths.\u000a That four eighths is equal to one half. Okay. All right, guys, keep on going. Answer the questions for envelope number two, and you guys can get started on envelope number three, okay?  All right, guys. So, you guys are on envelope number one?\u000a Yeah. We're done with envelope one, we're just like answering this question.\u000a You're doing what?\u000a We're done with envelope one, but we're answering it.\u000a Okay, so what is the question for envelope number one? Anthony, can you read it?\u000a It is--\u000a Someone in the class said that nine tenths was more than one third, because the bigger the number, the smaller the fraction. Are they correct? How would you explain to them where they were correct or incorrect?\u000a So, that's something that I've heard a lot of people in the class say. That the bigger the denominator, the smaller the fraction. Is that always true?\u000a No.\u000a No, why?\u000a Well, because, well, the smaller the denominator, that means like, sometimes it could be like smaller, smaller, but sometimes, I think, like, well, actually--\u000a You're doing good, keep on going.\u000a Well, since like, they're the whole--\u000a Okay.\u000a So, like, two pieces is two pieces, one's shaving it all away and the other one is for...\u000a So, what does the denominator actually tell you about a fraction?\u000a How many pieces the thing is cut into.\u000a How many pieces it's cut into. What does a numerator tell us about a fraction?\u000a How many are shaded.\u000a How many are shaded. So, then why, right here, why right here, is nine tenths so much bigger, or bigger than one third?\u000a Because it's close to one whole.\u000a Because it's close to one whole. And how could you explain it with what we just talked about? Savannah?\u000a Because it's 10 is the denominator and three is the other, so if there's 10, that means there's 10 of the small pieces, and there's nine of the small of those pieces.\u000a But there's nine of those pieces. So, how many of those pieces are shaded in?\u000a Nine.\u000a Good. And what about for one third? How many pieces would we shade in for one third?\u000a One.\u000a Good. All right, guys, well, keep on going. Keep on going, you guys are doing well. Try to answer these questions, and then start with envelope number two, okay? All right, guys, keep going. All right, so which envelope are you guys on right now?\u000a One, we're answering the questions.\u000a You're answering the questions?\u000a Yeah, and now I'm writing it down.\u000a Four. \u000a So, what did you say? What did you actually say for the second question?\u000a Oh, we, like, if you just, I'm not gonna say it exactly how she wrote it, but we just, we all agreed that if you keep--\u000a Simplifying.\u000a --simplifying a fraction, into its lowest terms, and if it can't go any lower, than like, then it's one half or one third, you'll know if, if it's equivalent to one half.\u000a Or you can find a common denominator.\u000a You can find a common denominator, and that will allow you to do what?\u000a To see if they're both the same number.\u000a To see if they're both the same number?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Pretty much, the same number.\u000a Okay, why don't you guys start envelope number two, then? Open up envelope number two, and see how you order these on the fraction line.\u000a Let's try one half first. First, three fourths. Wait.\u000a Wait.\u000a Yeah, three fourths goes right there, five eighths goes right here. No, no, it'll go right here. Wait. It goes right here.\u000a So why don't you guys use the fraction bars, then, to figure it out?\u000a Because I know three fourths is half of one--\u000a Three fourths is...\u000a Half of, wait.\u000a No, it would be more.\u000a It's half of--\u000a It would be more. It would be right here.\u000a Wait, I want you, I want you to explain that a little bit better for me. You said that three fourths is half of one half?\u000a I mean one fourth is half of one half.\u000a OK, one fourth is half of one half, so what about three fourths, then?\u000a And three fourths would go right here, because two fourths is equal to one half, and three fourths would be in the middle between one whole and one half.\u000a Right.\u000a Also, I was going to say that since we all know one half is right here, three fourths would go in front of five eighths, because one half of eight is four eighths, and then that goes right here one half of fourths is two fourths, and then, that's not the same. Three fourths of eight would be six eighths.\u000a Good. And how do you know that four over four goes right over here?\u000a 'Cause it's one, it's one whole. Wait. No, that would be the same place as three fourths. Wait, yeah, that would be the same place.\u000a Why would it be the same place?\u000a Because--\u000a Oh, it is.\u000a You said it's an equivalent fraction, can you explain what they said? Why did they say that three fourths and six eighths are equivalent fractions?\u000a Because they're the same. Because, because four times two is eight, and three times two is six.\u000a Okay. And why does that make two fractions equivalent, then? Could you show me using fraction tiles? \u000a I'll help you.\u000a You can do this.\u000a Four, five, six.\u000a So how many of these do you need?\u000a Six, seven.\u000a So what are you getting the six for?\u000a I'm getting eight six.\u000a I already have six, though.\u000a Three fourths.\u000a One, two, wait, where are the fourths?\u000a I believe right over, oh.\u000a Okay, so show me, show me using the fraction tiles why six eighths is the same as three fourths. What do you notice?\u000a We notice that they're the same length.\u000a They're the same length.\u000a And, also, we know that pretty much what Akosha said, that if you multiply, or if, yeah, if you multiply, like, if you multiply three times two, and four times two, it's six eighths, because four times two is, yeah, four times two is eight, and three times two is six.\u000a Do you notice anything else about it here?\u000a That two eighths equals one fourth.\u000a Good. Good. All right, guys, let me see the rest of this.\u000a Yeah.\u000a How did you know that five twelfths was less than one half? Go ahead.\u000a Six is half of twelve, and five twelfths is lower than six twelfths.\u000a Okay. Okay. Why did you know that one third is inbetween one fifth and five twelfths?\u000a 'Cause, like we don't that the smaller the denominator, the bigger it is, and so, one fourth would be in the middle. So, that would be on the other side of one fourth.\u000a Okay. All right, guys, keep on going. You're doing good. \u000a We've over. It's over.\u000a So, which one are you guys on now?\u000a Four, but we need help with one of the questions on three.\u000a Five, no, we need help on number four.\u000a Let's look at the question on number three that you guys are stuck on, then.\u000a We're not. We just have a question on what it is.\u000a A conjecture.\u000a A conjecture. So, conjecture is something that we, we've talked about before in math. If it says, "What conjecture," it's kind of like what a hypothesis is in science.\u000a

V Let's talk about the advantages and disadvantages of each company. Let's start with T-Shirts R Us. Okay, who can explain to me what's going on with T-Shirts R Us? Devon?\u000a  You have to pay a 50 dollar copay and you have to pay six dollars per shirt.\u000a Okay, so you've got to pay And then what do you pay per shirt?\u000a  Six.\u000a Six dollars per shirt. Okay, what are the advantages of that? How is this one in some way better than top of the line? Allegra, what's better about this company?\u000a  You only have to pay six dollars per shirt.\u000a You only have to pay six dollars per shirt. So, you're telling me six dollars per shirt is definitely better than eight dollars per shirt? Right? Okay, what's the disadvantage to this plan? Who can tell me the disadvantage to this one, Sarah?\u000a  You have to pay 50 dollars first.\u000a You have to pay 50 dollars up front, okay? So, if I were going to buy a lot of shirts, let's say I was going to buy 200 shirts, which company do you think would be the best for 200 shirts? Taylor?\u000a  I think the T-Shirts R Us would be better, because you only have to pay 50 dollars and the shirts are only six dollars per shirt.\u000a Yeah, for this one the more shirts you buy, the better deal it becomes, right? But for this one, if you're not going to buy, if we were only going to buy for say 10 people, would we want to pay that 50 dollars up front? Are we probably going to buy enough shirts to make up that difference? Probably not, okay. So for top of the line tees, our initial charge, the nice thing about top of the line, what's the advantage of top of the line?\u000a  They're eight dollars.\u000a That it, raise you hand. Kevin?\u000a  They're only eight dollars.\u000a They're already eight dollars but is that their advantage?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  No.\u000a  Patrick says no. Patrick, is their advantage that they're eight dollars per shirt? What's the advantage for top of the line?\u000a  Isn't it because the design is free?\u000a Is free, so do we have to pay anything up front?\u000a  No.\u000a No, so if Cameron, if you and I were the only people that wanted to get shirts, that would probably be a good place to go, right, because for eight plus eight we pay 16 dollars, but up here two shirts is going to be expensive, right? Right?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Yeah, it would be over 60 dollars, right?\u000a  62.\u000a That's not a very good price for shirts, okay. Brett?\u000a  I kind of brought this kind of up in my group even though it like wasn't really part of the data.\u000a  Okay?\u000a  Another thing I kind of thought whenever I was working on this last night, was if they're charging money for the graphic, couldn't it possibly be like a better graphic, but...\u000a It could be. It doesn't necessarily mean that it is, and I think for this we would probably be assuming that the quality would be at least comparable, maybe not identical but at least close, okay. All right. So, let's look at a couple of different things, okay? Let's start with these tables. You guys have had a minute to look at these tables. What, the first question says, which of the following tables represents T-Shirts R Us? With this being our given information, which one of these tables is T-Shirts R Us? Tell me how you know, Amanda.\u000a  The first one because the cost starts at 50 before you even buy any shirts?\u000a Okay, so Amanda says that this one is T-Shirts R Us, and how did you know that? You explained that in a really interesting way. How did you say that?\u000a  Because the costs are 50 before you buy any of the shirts.\u000a Yeah, Amanda says this one has to be T-Shirts R Us because you can see in the table the initial charge of 50 dollars. Do you guys agree that you can see the initial charge of 50 dollars?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Okay, that's one way to say it. Is there another way? Lindsay, you had something interesting on your paper. What's the other way that we can tell whether or not that's T-Shirts R Us?\u000a  I divided 30, divided by five equals six.\u000a Can you tell me where you got the number 30 and five?\u000a  In t-shirts there were a five dollar difference. The t-shirts goes up by five.\u000a Yeah, so this one goes up.\u000a  And the cost up by 30. And I just divided the two numbers and it told me which of the companies sells the shirts for six dollars.\u000a So she said that she found that the cost was going up 30 every time the shirts went up five. So, then to figure out how much each shirt was, she divided the 30 by six and figured out... Oh no, not by six, 30 by five and figured out that each shirt was six dollars per shirt. So, one way to figure it out is look at the rate of change, right, and another way to figure it out is to look at the initial cost. Like, what is it that you have to pay up front. So, in this problem can we see both? Can we look at this table and see here's what you have to pay up front and then here's what you have to pay per shirt? Can you see that?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Okay. Write that down. All right, so look at the table and let's talk about the original question that we asked. The original question that I asked you, and this was just a pick. Which company did you think would be the better option for our 25 students?\u000a  T-Shirts R' Us.\u000a What did you find out when you really, really investigated? Casey?\u000a  They're both 200 each.\u000a You really find out for exactly 25 students they both cost...?\u000a  200 dollars.\u000a 200 dollars. So, if we were just buying t-shirts for our class, would it matter which company we chose?\u000a  No.\u000a No. What if we decided we wanted to do all of my math students? If we decided we wanted to do all of my math students, which one of these tables would favor the option of buying it for all 100? Bree, what do you think? If we were going to buy t-shirts for all 100 students, because at 25, the cost is the same, right? Which one of these is going up more quickly?\u000a  The one on the left.\u000a The one on the left's going up more quickly? What do you think? Nahla says she disagrees. Nahla?\u000a  The one on the right is going up more quickly because it's going up by 40.\u000a Yeah, this one's going up how much every five shirts?\u000a  40.\u000a Yeah, this one's going up 40, and at that same time, this one's only going up?\u000a  30.\u000a 30, right Bree? So, Bree, which one's going up faster?\u000a  The right one.\u000a Yeah, so they're the same here. Do you guys see they're the same here? You see that Bree? But if this one's going up faster, if I'm going to buy a whole, if I'm going to buy a lot more shirts, what's going to eventually happen with this one?\u000a  It will increase.\u000a It's going to get increasingly more expensive, okay. So, somebody summarize this for me. What did we just figure out about tables? What did we just explain about tables? What can you find on tables? Sierra, tell me what we can find by looking at a table?\u000a  Y-intercept.\u000a  We can definitely find the Y-intercept. Can you tell me how we can find the Y-intercept?\u000a  When the X value is zero.\u000a When the X value is zero, that's going to be our Y-intercept. That was an excellent explanation. Guys, what else can we find from the graph? We can find the Y-intercept, what else can we find? Samantha?\u000a  We can find the slope.\u000a  We can find the slope, and can you summarize how we found the slope?\u000a  We found the differences between the y column and the x column and then we put in the rise over run.\u000a Yeah, we found the differences between the y column and the x column and then wrote them as the ratio rise over run. Excellent job, okay. So, that's tables. Cameron, question?\u000a  Is it okay on the table where it says, like, t-shirts in the columns, is it okay to put x and y over them?\u000a Cameron, if that helps you understand it then yes, that's completely fine. But you need to understand that x and y represent something. Right? It's okay for you to think about it as x and y, but just keep in mind that x represents the number of t-shirts and y represents cost, okay? That's a good question. All right, now let's look at the graph. Okay, suppose these two graphs were given to you. Okay, look at the graph. Is everything on the graph the same in terms of the way the graph's set up? Does the scale set look the same?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a The x-axis is identical and the y-axis is identical. So, let's talk about the graph for a second. Look at the graph. Adam, can you look at that graph and tell me which thing, which one of these two graphs do you think is top of the line?\u000a  The one on the right?\u000a The one on the right. Can you tell me why, because top of the line, keep in mind, the initial charge was zero and the cost per shirt was eight dollars per shirt. How did you pick this one to be top of the line?\u000a  Because it started at zero?\u000a Okay, so one of the things that's important was that you realized it started at zero. So, he looked at this and recognized that my, he said starts... at zero. Okay? That's important. How else could we figure out that that was, how else could we figure that out? Allegra?\u000a  I said that since it was five times eight, well, that's the first coordinate it would be.\u000a Oh, okay so the first coordinate was five, 40, so you said five times eight is...?\u000a  40.\u000a 40, okay, what about this one?\u000a  That is 80.\u000a 10 times eight is 80? Okay, is that an interesting way of thinking about it?\u000a  Yes.\u000a And does that also work? Does that make sense with this problem? Starts at zero and every shirt costs eight dollars, so she said five times eight, 10 times eight, and that pattern would work all the way up. Is there other ways that I could identify that this is top of the line, Amanda?\u000a  I went down there on the table, that the rate of the pulse goes up faster,\u000a Uh-Huh?\u000a  so, like, when you said how...\u000a Did you guys here the word she used to describe that? She said she recognized that this rate is going up faster than this rate. Do you guys agree with that?\u000a  The line's more steep.\u000a Yeah, the line has greater steepness is the word you used, steep, right? Yeah, so this one, not only does it start at zero, so we can recognize it that way, but we also recognize that it's going up more quickly. This one's going up eight dollars each shirt and this one's only going up six dollars each shirt, because, let's look at the rate of change for this one. If we went from zero to five, that went over five, right? And then from 50 up to 80, is what?\u000a  30?\u000a That's... from 50 to 80 is...?\u000a  30?\u000a 30, and so 30 over five gives me how much?\u000a  Six.\u000a Six per shirt, okay? Nahla, you had your hand up?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Go ahead.\u000a  I was gonna say, that I understand that it started at 50? So, that would be T-Shirts R Us? So, if that was T-Shirts R Us, then the other one had to be top of the line.\u000a Guys, did you hear what Nahla said? Nahla said she looked at this graph and noticed that this one started at 50, so, because that one started at 50 it had to be what?\u000a  T-Shirts R Us.\u000a  T-Shirts R Us, okay? So, so what're we talking about? We're talking about looking at a graph and finding two things. What are the two things that we need to be able to find from our graph? Greg tell me one.\u000a  Slope.\u000a We need to do our final slope. Emanuel tell me the other one.\u000a  The Y?\u000a We need to be able to find the slope and the y-intercept, okay? Emanuel, can you summarize for me how to find the y-intercept? How do you look at a graph and find the y-intercept?\u000a  Where the line crosses the y-axis?\u000a Where the line crosses the y-axis. So ,Sierra told us when we're on our table, we're looking for where...? \u000a  the x is zero,\u000a The x is zero, but on the graph that means that it crosses the y-axis. Okay, nice. Can somebody tell me from a graph, how to find slope? Stella, I haven't heard from you for a minute. How do we find slope from a graph?\u000a  You use the slope triangle.\u000a You use the slope triangle.\u000a  Uh-huh. Then it leads your eyes, for example, can we talk about this one?\u000a It doesn't matter, you pick whichever one you'd like.\u000a  So, it will be the rise and speed, it's going up.\u000a Yeah, so this is our rise, okay.\u000a  And the run is how far it's going out.\u000a And the run is how far it's going out.\u000a  It's rise over run.\u000a And then you write it as a ratio, rise to run, okay? Excellent. Guys, I have one final question on the graph. So, we picked these, we did our slope triangles from those blue ones that are drawn right? And for this one we got 30 over five and figured out that that was six, right? Would it matter if I did..., went too far I think. Would it matter if I did that?\u000a  No.\u000a I heard no. Can someone raise your hand and explain to me why that's no? So, why does it not matter? Sydney?\u000a  Because it's the same shape, it's just larger. It's a similar figure. So, I guess if you were finding rise over run and once you simplify it, it would be the same?\u000a Did you guys hear what Sydney said? Sydney used the word similar, or used the phrase, similar figures. What do similar figures mean? What does that mean, Greg?\u000a  Like, two figures that have the, like they're, they don't exactly have to be the same size? It's like, basically a dilation of the other.\u000a It's essentially a dilation. Okay, so the first one we did went up 30, over five. Right? Well what about the red one? The red one went from five to 20. How much did it go over, if it went from five to 20?  Cameron?\u000a  15?\u000a It went over 15. So, if this one goes over 15, you sort of used that word, dilation, right? What's the scale factor from five to 15?\u000a  Positive 3.\u000a That's times by positive 3, right? So, likewise, what should this be? If my run was 15, what should my rise be? Raise your hand if you know. Jaylynn?\u000a  90?\u000a It should be 90. Okay, so let's check and see if it is. So, we went from five, so that went 15, and then we went from 80 up to 170. Now, what's the difference from 80 to 170?\u000a  80 to what?\u000a 80 to 170.\u000a  I don't know.\u000a That's okay. What's the difference? Who can tell me the difference from 80 to 170? Sierra?\u000a  90?\u000a The difference is 90. So, if I looked at those two ratios, so, if I looked at those two ratios, one would give me 90 over 15 and the other one would give me 30 over five. Are those equal?\u000a  Yep.\u000a Yes, that is, let's check it. Are each of those giving you six dollars per shirt?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Yeah, so how do we find slope from a graph? Taylor said we make the slope triangle, and does it matter which triangle you pick?\u000a  Nope.\u000a No, because they should be proportional. They should be dilations of one another. Okay, it be a good reference to something that we learned.\u000a  Can you show us how to start out like the first one? Or the first few pages?\u000a So, the question was, do you have to start out at the first one?\u000a  No.\u000a Sydney, why no?\u000a  Because, if the pretense is that the initial charge is 50 dollars, then you don't have to. Unlike the other one, it started at zero.\u000a  Mm-hm?\u000a Are you talking about the final slope, Nahla?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Okay, Nahla, you can start at the first point, but you don't have to, because if it's linear, should the pattern ever change?\u000a  No. So, if the pattern never changes, does it matter which two points you pick?\u000a  No.\u000a Any two exact points you pick, should still give you the same rate of change. That was a great question. Okay, all right. So now, this is a different one. So, on the last one, I gave you the verbal. Right, I did, I said T-Shirts R Us and gave you the verbal expression. This time I'm not giving you that. This time, we've got a third t-shirt company. The third t-shirt company Tee Time, they explain to us, this is their function cost. Cost is equal to 4.50x, plus 25. My question is, what does that mean? Who can tell me what it means to do 4.5x, plus 25? Samantha, start me.\u000a  We would charge and 4.50 per each t-shirt.\u000a Okay, so what do we have to pay no matter what? Patrick, what is the one thing we have to pay? If we ordered a shirt, what's the one thing they're going to charge us?\u000a  For the design? They're going to charge us that 25 dollars for the design, right? But then...\u000a  Each time?\u000a Huh?\u000a  Each time?\u000a Well, that's a great question. Do they charge us 25 dollars every time? That's a great, great, great, great, great question. No, why not? What's the 25 dollars for?\u000a  It's for the design on every shirt.\u000a It's for the design, and that is the design that we're going to use for all of our shirts. So, that's an important question. Does the y-intercept explain anything about change? Will the y-intercept change? Will it move up or down? No, the initial cost is whatever the initial cost is, okay? That was a great question. Who can tell me a little bit about what this graph would look like? What would the graph look like?\u000a  It looks like a zero,  but I think it'd start at 25 here.\u000a It would start at 25. So, it's go to start somewhere right in here, okay? And I'm not sure why those numbers are on the table, but they shouldn't be there. Okay, but that's okay. We can move forward from it. We can do this. What should the cost be initially?\u000a  25.\u000a The cost should initially be 25 dollars, okay. Then if we buy five shirts, how can we figure that out? Who can tell me how to figure that out? Ah, ?\u000a  You can plug in the value of five in the equation thing.\u000a You can plug into the equation? Ooh, I know what we can use. Oh, we can use... I heard somebody say this earlier. We can use a calculator right? Where would I put this information in the calculator?\u000a  Y equals.\u000a I'd go to y equals, excellent. Okay, and I put it in there my function. Right, so I've got 4.50x, plus 25.\u000a  And then you press second?\u000a Yeah, what am I trying to look at? I'm trying to look at my table. Let's go back for just a second. Look at the table that's already given to us. What do they do in their table?\u000a  It increases by five.\u000a They increase their x values by five. So, do I want to set mine up to go by fives?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Yeah, so how do, didn't I, how do I set up a table?\u000a Where do I do that?\u000a  It's a second and it's on top of a window?\u000a Yeah, it's second and it's on top of a window, we've got a table set up. Where do we want to start our table? What's the first number we need?\u000a  Five.\u000a Okay, because we already know zero, right? And then how much do we want to increase each time?\u000a  Five.\u000a We want to increase each time by fives, okay. Are we okay with that? Now, where do I go to actually have the calculator give me the information? Sydney, where do I go?\u000a  You press second and then you press the graph button?\u000a Second, graph, which will give me the table. So, I will give you a minute to make sure that your table is still being corrected, because I'm going to need you to help me with mine. I don't know why I put the wrong table up there. Okay, we good? All right so we used the calculator to help us get our table. What was it in fives? Who can help me with this? Help me with this, Cameron, real quick.\u000a  47.5.\u000a That's 47.5, or 47.50, right? What about tens?\u000a  70.\u000a

V Right here. Okay, so is that gonna tell us what one of our asymptotes is?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yes, because your asymptote is where this would be undefined, right? So, it's gonna be X equals what?\u000a Positive two?\u000a Positive, but, okay, if we put positive two there, we have two plus two.\u000a So, it'd be negative two?\u000a Negative two, that's why we have an asymptote that X equals negative two, okay? Now is there another number out here?\u000a No. No, so what would that other number be? See there is one here, but there's not one here.\u000a So it'd just be zero.\u000a So, it'd just be zero. So, does that tell you what your other asymptote is? Y equals zero, 'cause f of x stands for... that's your y isn't it? Okay. So, you can tell by looking at the function itself, what your asymptotes are gonna be. Okay, tell me what this asymptote's gonna be, your x, your vertical asymptote.\u000a  Zero?\u000a  Zero, X equals zero, so you're gonna be drawing your asymptote right there. What about your y? Remember how we covered this up, and you would have y equals what?\u000a Negative one?\u000a Negative one, y plus negative one. So, the function itself tells you your asymptotes, doesn't it? Okay, does that help?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay. \u000a  All right, so...\u000a  No, but it's like that right here though.\u000a  But see she has negative two.\u000a  Right here.\u000a  Then how did she get the, did we write the first one wrong then?\u000a  'Cause x equals zero.\u000a  No, because she got zero and negative two, and that's what I got. You wrote it down wrong.\u000a  Where?\u000a  Right here, 'cause zero is supposed to be on top. Oh, so, no, never mind, you got it right.\u000a  It's the same. I just switched these around. No, but you're right because you know how x is vertical, okay, so, for this one it's going to be, the x is going to be negative 2, right?\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a Okay I got it.\u000a  So wait, the asymptote isn't the same thing as the parent function, right?\u000a No.\u000a Did you have the graph? Did it turn out?\u000a And how do you know, up here?\u000a Check this thing out.\u000a Huh?\u000a  So, what would the parent function be?\u000a That's what I was trying to work out for you.\u000a  Did you find the parent function?\u000a For what?\u000a It's not x squared, is it?\u000a One over x.\u000a  All of them is going to be one over x.\u000a 'Cause you can't just put x. She said put a one divided by x. That'd be the parent function.\u000a  All right.\u000a How do you know which is the parent function?\u000a It's the one that's consistent.\u000a That first one that you put.\u000a It's the one that's exactly in between the first and third quadrant. This is your parent function. This is your parent function.\u000a This one and this one, right? So blue right there and right there.\u000a But you totally ruined it.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah, the colors I used are kind of weird.\u000a Do you have a red? Are you using it?\u000a This is the graph, right? So, if it's the first one and the third one, right?\u000a Hey wait, that first thingy comes out at negative three, not negative two.\u000a Hm?\u000a  This first little line right here comes out negative three, not negative two. Is the parent function still, I mean, is the asymptote still negative two?\u000a I think\u000a  \u000a So, how is one negative two?\u000a  You gotta switch it, because the one x plus two when you use the calculator you go into a negative, so the y would be zero because it's not going to negative.\u000a How would the y be zero, the y is a negative?\u000a You got em' switched, all you gotta do is switch em'.\u000a I'm not understanding. She busy.\u000a Okay. Oh, I know why. It's because we don't have no y in the equation. Like this one, it'd have a y. The y would be negative one. And on this one, we don't have it, so, automatically the y would be zero and the x would be negative two.\u000a That makes more sense.\u000a  All right you got it.\u000a Yeah I had to think about that.\u000a \u000a  So, that's how you do it.\u000a So, then the asymptote is the...  right here?\u000a  Uh-huh.\u000a Which one?\u000a So, then the translation is the down one.\u000a Wait, what?\u000a The translation is the down one.\u000a So, what is this down?\u000a  Let me plug it in. Divide by x parentheses... One over, divided by x minus one.\u000a Okay, so we don't need no parenthesis?\u000a  No.\u000a  I'm almost done.\u000a You're crossing it, that's the y, yeah. But that's the x. This is x and this is y.\u000a Yes.\u000a  Well, look on the sheet. It will show you that, um...\u000a I basically used this one as an example. It's like the same type of format that the problem is.\u000a Okay.\u000a Okay, yeah that makes sense.\u000a So, the asymptote is zero.\u000a It says h equals x .\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah, so zero, yeah wait... Yeah.\u000a  This is the graph you start with?\u000a Yeah, that makes more sense 'cause that's how the graph is. Okay, we got the asymptote. X equals, is it zero? Yeah, and then y equals negative one. And the translation is one unit down. Do you have a value?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Uh-oh.\u000a So, it'd be three units down. We would put this on negative three cause that's y. So, since it's y, we would have to put it on negative three and zero.\u000a Right?\u000a  'Cause it's the same as this.\u000a Yeah.\u000a And then y equals negative three.\u000a Yeah, x equals zero and y equals negative three. Translation, three units down.\u000a Wherever the lines, like, go the furthest but don't touch.\u000a Okay.\u000a Oh, you're just marking down the asymptotes?\u000a Yeah. She said she forgot, yeah, so I guess you can just put up there yellow.\u000a Okay. Are you on number four?\u000a Yes.\u000a So, on number four it would be five units to the left.\u000a Number four, yeah, yeah, you're good.\u000a Okay.\u000a She just told me, she just told,\u000a I just wrote it wrong I guess, then.\u000a How do you know how to graph it with... ?\u000a Like in the calculator?\u000a In here. And it's really not good to graph it here.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay.\u000a This seems to be not that hard, now that I get it.\u000a Really.\u000a Like, remember how Grayson thought that it was three I knew she was wrong... .\u000a I mean, I didn't think it was wrong.\u000a You just instinctively knew that it was wrong.\u000a \u000a  Is it going to have a vertical shift also?\u000a Yep, up, down, down.\u000a Okay, up or down?" Down how many?\u000a Two.\u000a On number five?\u000a Oh, three. It would be three.\u000a Three. Okay, so you're going to have two shifts on number five, right? Okay?\u000a Uh huh. I haven't plugged it in yet.\u000a We're going to have a shift here, right? What would make that undefined? If x equals...? How about positive two? Because two minus two is zero. I mean, the zero is where you needed to be. So, x equals two, right? Okay, now, what are we going to do with this thing out here? That's a vertical shift of y equals... negative three. Y equals negative three.\u000a \u000a So, we have two translations, okay? Two units right and...\u000a

V  Megan, what quadrant am I going to be centered in?\u000a Quadrant four?\u000a  Good, okay, so I'm gonna go to the right six, and down five... I know my radius is three root seven. Now, this may be a little difficult for you, because three root seven is kind of a hard number to wrap your mind around. Any thoughts on how we can tell which quadrants this goes into? I want to know if it goes into quadrant one first. Twink, what could we do?\u000a Do you un-simplify it, so when it gets through the center, it'd be like, square root of 63, and then you like, have..., so it's in-between eight, nine, or I know it's in-between seven and eight.\u000a  Okay, did you guys follow her on that?\u000a  Yeah!\u000a Yeah, okay, so Twink knows that this decimal is going to be between seven and eight, because she knows it's the square root of 63. And the square root of 64 is eight. So, it's just below eight. All right? So, you may be able to picture a decimal in your mind, close to eight, but not quite, so we're armed with that knowledge, true or false, this circle goes into quadrant one. Melissa.\u000a  \u000a  Agree?\u000a  No.\u000a  Ben?\u000a Yes, it does go into quadrant one.\u000a  Do you have anything to back that up?\u000a  Yeah, because it only, the center point is down six, and if we go up one more than that, at least.\u000a  James?\u000a It's down five, and since it's more than seven, it's gotta be at least past the two.\u000a There were a lot of pronouns there. What James was saying is, we're five units below the x-axis, the radius is seven point something units long, so we're going to top out right around there. There's the top of our circle, okay. Let's speed up this process a little bit here. The, is it going to go into quadrant three?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Why, Abby Simpson?\u000a  Because it's over six,  and yeah, you count seven the other way.\u000a  Okay?\u000a  Or a little over seven.\u000a  So, we're going to be there.  Oh, and now for the great dilemma, will this circle go into quadrant two, Robert, what am I going to have to resort to?\u000a  The distance formula?\u000a  I can't hear you.\u000a  The distance formula.\u000a  Okay, give me some more pairs to plug into this formula. William?\u000a Zero, sorry, zero minus six squared, and then zero plus five squared.\u000a  All right. Now what is the square root of 61 in simplified radical form? Rue?\u000a Is it just square root of 61?\u000a  Good, maybe that was a trick question. Maybe not, it's not going to break down any further, because 61 is what type of number again?\u000a  Prime.\u000a  Prime, okay, so, we've got square root of 61. Robert, you told me to use distance formula, I used distance formula. I followed your orders to the T. I still don't know if this goes into quadrant two or not.\u000a It does not.\u000a  The circle doesn't make it to quadrant two?\u000a  No.\u000a  So, you're saying it does this?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Prove it.\u000a  Well if you actually put, I don't know...\u000a \u000a  Call on someone else please.\u000a  Maddie.\u000a Since you know that your radius is the square root of 63, and that's a larger number than the square root of 61, it therefore passes the origin, and it goes into the opposite quadrant, or quadrant two in this case.\u000a So, you're saying it goes like that.\u000a  Correct.\u000a Is that good enough for your piece of mind? The radius is longer than it needs to be to reach. And therefore yeah, you're right. Moral of the story? The circle goes through all four quadrants. So far, we've kind of been in, been there, done that land, and so now I'm going to take you into some new stuff, right now. The x and y intercepts. First, the x-intercepts of this graph. How am I going to find where this circle collides with the x-axis? Let me ask an intermediate question, what do you know about every x-intercept in the universe? They all have something in common, Abby?\u000a  All of their lines, like the y equals zero?\u000a  What, I'm sorry.\u000a Okay, all like the y's equal zero... like the y?\u000a  Which variable?\u000a Y.\u000a  Equals?\u000a Zero.\u000a  One more time.\u000a Y equals zero.\u000a Okay does that makes sense to you guys?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Because if you do go up or down to plot your ordered pair, I've got bad news for you, you're not on the x-axis any more. Thus, it's not an x-intercept. All right, just one more time Abby, I forgot what you had said earlier.\u000a  Y equals zero.\u000a Okay, so how am I going to find my x-intercepts here? Twink?\u000a  I have a question, does it like, the circle cross over x, like the x-axis twice?\u000a  Well, we'll find out if it does.\u000a  I mean sometimes, doesn't it?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So, what do you do if it does?\u000a  So, this is the first time in your math careers where you might have two x-intercepts. Colliding once, and coming back down and colliding again with the x-axis, that's good instincts. And I'll just warn you right now, yeah, we're going to have two x-intercepts here. Maddie, how are we going to find these two?\u000a  We use the formula of a circle, and we plug in for y, zero?\u000a  Okay, so let's get the equation up here, because I forgot to write it earlier. Josh?\u000a  Ah, I don't remember.\u000a Ella May?\u000a  X squared... X squared plus, or minus six? Or no, x minus six.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Squared, plus y? Plus five. Squared, equals 63.\u000a Okay, Maddie, now we have our equation, and you said to do what to it?\u000a Since you know you have, when you're looking for an x-intercept, you're always going to have zero for your y.\u000a  Oh, Abby told us that.\u000a Yeah, you have your y in that formula equal zero.\u000a  Literally, literally.\u000a   Well, we've got to see what x is, Ben.\u000a  Well, I know but that's it?\u000a Does it make sense to you?\u000a  Yeah!\u000a It isn't that hard of a concept, and that's why I had Abby repeat it eight times. If you get that y literally has to be zero, you understand why you literally make y zero, and then solve for x. We're finding, here's one of the ordered pairs right here that we're searching for, and I'll be darned if the y is gonna be zero. The question is, what's the x? All right, so I've got x minus six squared. Plus, I'm just going to write five squared equals 63. So, according to my calculations, we have that right there. Mason?\u000a  You forgot that middle term. It should be minus 12 x? Yeah, or something like that. You forgot the middle term. You forgot, like, the something x. Yeah, it'd be x squared minus 12 x, and then plus 36.\u000a Oh, so I need to square both those terms?\u000a  Yes, no wait, what'd you say?\u000a I just wanted to square the x and square the negative six.\u000a  No you didn't, you wanted to square the whole thing.\u000a Okay, which means we utilize what process in math? What's that called again, Twink?\u000a  Foil?\u000a  Foil, we had forgotten our oi, Ben.\u000a  Where did we get 12 x from?\u000a Vanessa?\u000a We squared x minus six, so we used factoring. We did x minus .\u000a Now do you see where we get it from, Ben? Okay, thank you Ben. What to do with the 63, what to do, what to do? Mason?\u000a Do you just combine, like subtract 63 from both sides, combine all the like terms of the whole numbers, and then you have a quadratic equation.\u000a  Okay. Well, now I have a quadratic trinomial, and it's arranged in what? What do we call that, Kate?\u000a  Ellie?\u000a Descending order.\u000a Mm-hm. Nice, so let's try and factor that. Michelle, you're shaking your head like no way.\u000a  It doesn't work. Well, all right, then I guess we're stuck.\u000a \u000a  That's so stupid.\u000a  Don't we have to do  the quadratic formula?\u000a  Yes, if only I could remember that though. It's been such a long time.\u000a  Sing the song!  You tell me the song, I'll actually write the line pertinent to this problem, what's the first line?\u000a \u000a  Keep going...\u000a   Plus or minus the root of b squared minus 4 a-c, all over 2a. \u000a  Okay. I'm going to do some of the math for you, and then I'm going to have you do some of the math for me, because I'm more interested in seeing that you can do this. So, I get 12 plus or minus the square root of 152, over two. Now normally, normally I would have you guys simplify that and give me exact answers. But it's hard on a graph for you guys to see where something like 12 plus root 152 is, I mean that's kind of an abstract.\u000a So, we're actually, I'm going to let you do decimals here. So, here's what I want to do, Kevin's row through Sarah's row, I want you guys to find the plus branch, so you do plus. You two rows, find the minus. As soon as you get an answer, real quietly and quickly check with a neighbor, and make sure we have confirmation. Let's go to the nearest hundredth.\u000a  Okay, if you've got an answer that corresponds to what your neighbor got, regroup. Regroup, Ellie. If you've got the same answer as your neighbor, raise your hand right now, over here. So, Melissa, what was the value of x you got?\u000a  12.2.\u000a  12.2, what is it to the nearest hundredth?\u000a  Oh, 12.16.\u000a  12.16. All right,  that sounds about right. And then over here, my branch with the negative sine in there, Ellie?\u000a  Negative 0.16.\u000a Okay, now let's not lose sight of big picture here. Context, what the heck's going on? Why have we been trying to chase down x, and why are we getting two different answers? And which one is right, and which one's extraneous? Help me make sense of all this, now that the procedure is done, Michelle?\u000a  Neither of them are extraneous, because the circle hits the x-axis at two points?\u000a  So, what are my two x-intercepts?\u000a 12.16, and negative .16?\u000a  In ordered pair form.\u000a 12.16, zero, and negative .16, zero.\u000a There's that one right there, makes sense. And then the 12.16, zero hopefully you have room on your paper, I don't have room on the board for that. Should be somewhere over here. It's a good pit stop moment right here. Pull off to the side of the road. Stop for a second, are you sure this makes sense to you?\u000a

V  Okay, so, write your conjectures down. Denominators are repeating. Actually, let's put this one on number four. Put it on number four. \u000a We got any even number that had any odd number. \u000a  Okay, so if it's an odd number in the denominator, it's repeating. If it's got an even number in the denominator?  Oh, okay, so you want to add to it not just say it's even. If it's odd over even --\u000a It's terminating,\u000a  It's terminating. and what if it's even over even?\u000a Even over even? Two over six. It would one be one over three You'd have to simplify it.\u000a  Okay, you'd have to simplify it, and so what would happen when you simplified 2/6 to 1/3?\u000a It would be repeating.\u000a  It would be repeating, so maybe you're on to something. Might want to record that. Let's check. That's good. I haven't heard that one before, guys. All right, let me here some of your conjectures. This group, we're going with their conjecture. What's your conjecture guys?\u000a  That all odd denominator fractions will repeat.\u000a All right, here's the conjecture. All odd numbers in the denominator will be repeating decimals. Anybody want to add to it? Take away from it? Change it? All right, what we got here, over here?\u000a That's false because point two five goes into 100 4 times.\u000a  Okay, hold on.\u000a  I'm confused. Point two five. What is point two five represented as a fraction?\u000a  1/4.\u000a 1/4, and they said all odd numbers are repeating.  So far it works.\u000a  Well then 1/5.\u000a All right, let's try 1/5. Well hold on then. Let's get all the conjectures before we start trying them out. I do love the action that you want to make up your own fractions and try it 'cause I don't think it's safe just to take it at a glance. All right, Dylan, what did y'all's group. George, share for your group. What did y'all say?  Listen guys.\u000a We had two.\u000a  You had two, okay.\u000a Even over odd equals terminating.\u000a  Even over odd is terminating, okay.\u000a  And even over even is repeating.\u000a  Even over even is repeating.\u000a He meant two by that.\u000a Okay, so basically, and then I would assume that odd over odd would go here? Okay, my only question is I see even over odd, odd over odd, even over even, what's the other option?\u000a  Odd over even.\u000a Odd over even, where do you think that would go? Do you think it would go terminating?\u000aYes.\u000a Well, let's pick something really quick. 3/4. That's odd over even. That would be terminating. Okay, so opposites, even and odd, odd and even, you're thinking opposites --\u000a Attract?\u000a There you go. Opposites attract to be terminating, and when they're the same even and even and odd and odd. \u000a They repel.\u000a Okay, and they repeat. Pretty good. Here's what I want you to do now. Based on what you just told me, look at number six. I've given you fractions. I want you, let's look at them as a group. I want to come to a consensus as a class. Do we all agree with this groups thinking? \u000a We didn't get to share ours because 8/9 repeat.\u000a Okay, 8/9 is even over odd, and that repeats, so maybe we want to cancel this one out, and it's just odd over even? \u000a There might be something else. It might be that that doesn't go, necessarily, doing anything like the rules for divisibility like seven and eight, they don't have a rule because it just doesn't work, but it's right. It might be that that doesn't work.\u000a Maybe if it's even a law, you just gotta work it out.\u000a So do we want to make our rule this? If it's odd over eating. Eating? Is it time for lunch? If it's odd over even, it's terminating, everything else is repeating? \u000a We should test it out before.\u000a 3/4 is terminating, but 7/8 isn't terminating 'cause eight...\u000a  7/8? Try it on your paper real quick. 7/8.\u000a  It terminates.\u000a  So do we want to use this?  No and yes, okay, let's --\u000a Let's do more though.\u000a  Let's do a democracy here, okay? If you're liking the, well hold on. Who says no? Who doesn't want to use this? Why?\u000a Those rules may not work all the time for every fraction.\u000a  Okay, so do you have a better rule or conjecture?  So far is it working?  Based on what we know and the numbers we've generated so far, let's use that rule to categorize the following fractions, and I think we could do this as a group. So here I've got, our rule we said we wanted to try was odd over even. Everything else is going in repeating. Odd over even. We've already done these, so here's our new fractions, okay? What is this fraction here?\u000a  11/24\u000a It's odd over even, so where do we want to put it?\u000a  Terminating.\u000a Terminating.\u000a  Terminating\u000a Odd over even, would make it terminating. Six what?\u000a  Sevenths.\u000a 6/7?\u000a  Repeating.\u000a Even over odd terminates. \u000a But that didn't work. That didn't work.\u000a We tried it, and we saw that it didn't work, remember? Yeah, odd over even is the only one we're going with, so I've got an odd over even. I got odd over odd.\u000a Repeating.\u000a And I've got an odd over even.\u000a  Terminating.\u000a Okay, so here's what I want you to do. Check it. Use your calculators as a group, check it. Circle, go ahead and write 'em down. Categorize them just like I did on the board. Write 'em in your chart and circle any that don't belong. \u000a  Use your calculator. \u000a It doesn't work. Odd over even.\u000a  It doesn't work? Oh, no! Which one doesn't work? \u000a Seven over six doesn't work.\u000a All right, let's do this then. The 6/7, were we correct there?  All right, this one's right.\u000a No.\u000a This one was repeating or terminating?\u000a  Terminating.\u000a All right, so this one, we need to move over here. All right, 5/13?\u000a I haven't checked --\u000a Haven't check that one.\u000a Five divided by 13.\u000a We don't know. Too many decimals.\u000a  Okay, if it's too many, what do you think it's going to be?\u000a  Repeating.\u000a Probably going to be repeating, so that one looks good. Let's do this.  Hold on, I want you guys to try 11/24. I want you to do 15/14. I want you to check 199 over 200, and I want you all to check nine over 80. \u000a These rules already tested out.\u000a That's terminating. \u000a The rules weren't tested enough to be proven.\u000a  I think my rule is solid even though it's kind of condensed. \u000a  Five, four, three, two, one. Thank you. All right, 11/24? It stays? All right, it repeats, so it goes over here. All right, 15/14.\u000a  Repeating.\u000a  All right, let me change this though. Let's change this one to 15/24. Check that one. And while they're checking --\u000a Point 625.\u000a  Point 625, so it's actually going to terminate, okay? Repeating or terminating?\u000a Terminating.\u000a  It terminated? And nine over 80?\u000a  Terminating.\u000a  Terminating, okay, so it didn't work.\u000a So odd over even doesn't work?\u000a Right, it didn't work, so let's think about it then. We got a --\u000a Do you know a rule?\u000a I don't know, so I'm kind of doing this with you. Let's look at this. What is important? Do you think the numerator is important? Well, if the numerator's what's important?\u000a I think they're evenly important.\u000a They're evenly important?\u000a Without one, the other wouldn't be the same fraction.\u000a Do you agree? He said, "Without one, "the other wouldn't be the same fraction." What do you mean by that?\u000a You said, "Which one's important?" If you say the numerator's important, then if you change the denominator it might not work, so they're not the same fraction without one another.\u000a Okay.\u000a If the numerator is one less than the denominator, then it will be repeating.\u000a If the numerator is one less than the denominator? What about 5/13?\u000a That's just one rule, there's multiple --\u000a Right, well, I want to come up with just one rule that works for them all. So let's look at this. If the numerator is what's important, can we not look at these two fractions here? What do they both have in common? They both have a common denominator, and they have different numerators, and it's actually put 'em in two, separate categories, but they're both odd.\u000a Prime number.\u000a  Oh, you're seeing something about prime number? \u000a If it's prime over even it'll be repeating, but a prime over an even would be...\u000a Okay, so we're gonna do prime over even is which one?\u000a Repeating.\u000a Prime over even is repeating.\u000a Okay, because even number has what factor in it? Automatically?\u000a Two.\u000a A two, and will a prime number have two as a factor?  A prime number will have two as a factor? What are the factors of prime numbers?\u000a  One and itself.\u000a The only problem with that is the number what?\u000a  Two.\u000a Two, okay, so I think you're on to something.\u000a If it's prime over even, then it'll be repeating.\u000a  Prime over even, then it's repeating?\u000a I found a problem with that.\u000a Here's what I want you to do.\u000a I did 11 over eight.\u000a  11 over eight.\u000a It's prime over even.\u000a Okay, it is a mix number. It's not a mixed number, I'm sorry. It's a?\u000a  Improper fraction.\u000a What would it need to be a mixed number? \u000a A whole number.\u000a  And a fractional part. Good job. All right, so here's my question then. Here's what I want you to do. Look up here, and I think with fractions we always seem to stress when we're doing equivalent fractions. To put a fraction in its what?\u000a Simplest form.\u000a Simplest form. Anytime there's a prime number it's already going to be in its simplest form, right? 'Cause you can't reduce it anymore, so these are already in their simplest forms. What about 15/24? Is there a factor that they both have in common?\u000a Three.\u000a Three, okay, so if I factor out three out of fifteen?\u000a  Five.\u000a I got a five.\u000a  Eight.\u000a So that's an equivalent fraction, so I'm going to get rid of that. Odd over even. So maybe we could say in a fraction's, what?\u000a Simplest form.\u000a  Simplest form. In a fraction's simplest form if it's odd over even, then it, what?\u000a Terminates.\u000a  Terminates.\u000a So are we doing a rule that applies to every number?\u000a  Every single number. So if we were to make a conjecture, do we just base it off of six numbers?\u000a  No.\u000a  What I want you to do is I want you as a group to come up with your own example that can either prove this or disprove this conjecture. The conjecture is that a fraction in its simplest form, if it's odd over even, will terminate. I want every group to make up their own, as a group make up your own example.\u000a Let's do 7/6. \u000a  You make up your own, Buck. You make up your own. You got notebook paper if you want it.\u000a I made it up, so can we do it again?\u000a  No, I want a new one they haven't seen. \u000a So 5/6?\u000a  5/6, okay. Try 5/6. Is it in simplest form?\u000a Yes\u000a  Okay.  And, so, it actually repeats.\u000a It disproves the theory.\u000a  So it disproves it, doesn't it?\u000a

V  No, I want you to swing the eighth notes. Okay? We're going to swing the eighth notes. So, remember when you swing you just make the first note longer than the second note. So, go like this... \u266a  \u266a\u000a Don't be stuck at the tip of your bells. Here we go. One, a two, a three and go. \u266a  \u266a\u000a Every single person here, please make sure you're playing F natural. Try it again. Here we go. One, two and go. \u266a  \u266a\u000a Okay. Now, when you guys improvise, you've got to improvise off of this D dorian scale. Okay? So, watch this. If I was soloing, and I was, you know, playing along with the music, and I played this... \u266a  \u266a\u000a All I did was play the D dorian scale, going up and down. That's all it was. It sounded a little fancy, didn't it? It really wasn't. Did it sound difficult?\u000a  Yes.\u000a It really wasn't. I just did this, like really changing the rhythm. \u266a  \u266a\u000a That's basically all I did. Okay? So, it's really not that difficult. I'm gonna play some rhythms. I want you guys to echo it. Please sit up. Thank you. Nice and tall. I'm gonna play one measure and you're going to repeat exactly what I play. We're playing this one on open D. Only on open D. \u266a  \u266a\u000a Great, now I'm going to do two measures. Okay? Two measures and you've got to echo it back to me. This is still open D. Here we go. Wait for it, I'll tell you when to go. \u266a  \u266a\u000a Excellent. Okay, it goes like this. I'm going to change it. \u266a  \u266a\u000a And go. \u266a  \u266a\u000a There it is. Okay. It's just four notes in the second measure. So, try it again. \u266a  \u266a\u000a And go. \u266a  \u266a\u000a Do this for me. \u266a  \u266a\u000a And go. \u266a  \u266a\u000a Try this. I'm playing D and F. So, the higher pitch that you hear is F natural. So, play this for me. \u266a  \u266a\u000a Great. Fantastic. I'm only going to add one more note. You want to play D, F, and G. Okay? With the exception of basses. So do an open G okay? So, D, F, and G are your three notes. All right, get in playing position. \u266a  \u266a\u000a Okay. So, basically that's improvising. I'm giving you a lot of ideas for improvising. Okay? And you will only use three notes when you improvise. D, F, and G. You don't have to use all three but those are your only musical choices as far as notes. When you improvise, there are certain rules to improvising. You can't just play any note, because if you play the wrong note it will not be the right choice. Okay? So, we don't want to play the wrong note. So, please make sure that you only play D, F, and G. Do you see that tune that's on whatever page that's on for you guys? There should be a page that's got solos at the top, and then it has solo two and solo one to the side and then tune. You'll pick the third one with the tune. Do you guys see it?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. Make sure you're on the correct side. I'll play the tune for you so you can hear how it sounds, and then I'm going to have you guys play it. Okay? Listen to my tempo. \u266a  \u266a\u000a Are you guys following along? \u266a  \u266a\u000a Okay? Play it for me. Here we go. Watch your rests. One, two and go. \u266a  \u266a\u000a Much better. Now. \u266a  \u266a\u000a Good. Now, play it again. One, two and go. \u266a  \u266a\u000a Good. I want you to play it one more time. I'm going to play the piano with you though. All right. Here we go. \u266a  \u266a\u000a Great. Now, I'm going to solo for you guys, and I want to show you how you can do this. Okay? \u266a  \u266a \u000a A couple things that I did in there. All I did was play a dorian scale up and down and swung my eighth note. That's all I did. It sounds really difficult, didn't it?\u000a Yeah.\u000a It was like whoa! No, I'm just going... \u266a  \u266a\u000a I can make it sound fancy and make it sound really difficult. You can do it, too. Okay. So, we're going to go around the room. Each person is going to solo. Okay? Whatever musical idea you come up with. Remember, your notes are D, F, and G. You got it? D, F, and G. Whatever rhythm you want to play, within the rhythms I gave you. So don't...  Okay? Here we go. Here's how we're going to do it. We're going to start with maybe two measures. We're going to start with Tessa and go around. Maybe after, Helen. Then we go with Tallulah. Priscilla, listen carefully. After Tallulah we're going to go around this way. After Jada, we're going to start with Sammy and we're going to end with Zoey. Okay? We're all going to start with two. \u266a  \u266a\u000a

V Exactly. Right. So, what do you all think about the fact that this is written almost sort of journalistically? I know you're the big newspaper man and everything. What do you think about that?\u000a That's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the growth of the poem overall. The first passage, it's almost not objective, but it kind of states what's happening. It doesn't actually say what the author is thinking. As the poem grows and goes on and goes to the next passages, it becomes more poetic and more descriptive and it's more of the author's point of view and the author's stance on what's happening.\u000a Nora, what do you think about the poem so far?\u000a I thought it was a good, like, utilization of the message. I'm taking African American history this year.\u000a Okay.\u000a We've been talking about the slave trade the last few weeks. So, that first part, we were talking about how they were like , the sickness.\u000a What are the specific lines that you think best describe the sickness and the death and everything?\u000a "We have jettisoned the blind to no avail. It spread. The terrifying sickness spreads. It's claws have scratched the sight from the captain's eyes." The slaves were all tied together in their own  so the sickness and disease could spread through them. But also, the slavers, like the white people on the ship were also susceptible to disease.\u000a That's where they got the idea of whites becoming more like the blacks because they're in such close quarters that it's inevitable almost and the fact that they are holding themselves above them, superior as civilized, but they're still acting acts of barbarism is very much a historical principle.\u000a So, you really think that there's a moment of transformation in this poem where the whites, who are theoretically the real barbaric people become like the blacks, who they think are savages.\u000a I don't think it's even a point of transformation. I believe that the author, Robert Hayden, is talking about this as it has been. So, this kind of opens in maybe a stress when they're sailing on the slave ship and they talk about this and it's like there's all sorts of imagery throughout this that implies that these blacks are, er, these whites are becoming like the blacks.\u000a What's your favorite line that shows this, Nick?\u000a "Standing to America, bringing home black gold, black ivory, black seed." Now, I especially liked the middle part of that, black ivory. Because ivory is usually white.\u000a Of course. Yes.\u000a Yeah.\u000a So, you have the juxtaposition of black and white.\u000a Yes.\u000a I think the lines after that, "Deep in the festering hold thy father lies, of his bones, New England pews are made, those are altar lights that were his eyes." Jordan, what do you think the about this religious connotation?\u000a Well, seeing that I'm not too familiar with the Bible-- Judaism and Christianity are similar-- but in these two paragraphs that you were just reading, I saw a big contrast between the glory of taking back these animals, these slaves and making the best of them in the new world. Between that and the evil that they're really bestowing upon the slaves-- "Standing to America, bringing home black gold, black ivory, black seed," is kind of glory and that contrast between evil, "Deep in the festering hold thy father lies, of his bones, New England pews are made, those are altar lights that were his eyes."\u000a They also kind of need a religious figure throughout this voyage because throughout this we see that they're going through a time of spiritual crisis. "What port awaits us, Davy Jones or home? I've heard of slavers drifting, drifting, play things of wind and storm and chance, their crews gone blind, the jungle hatred crawling up on deck." It's like they understand that they're becoming uncivilized and they're trying to find a way to change this.\u000a To justify their actions.\u000a Yeah.\u000a That's what they need, a justification for their actions. So, they say God is with them and everything is okay.\u000a And you have that sort of anaphora of the hymn, that "Jesus our Savior pilot," throughout this entire thing that sort of brings and invokes the God into all of this so that it's almost as if to me, they're looking for their justification. They're looking to justify the horrific actions that they're putting out.\u000a Which is ironic because these are often, these spirituals are often sung by slaves to get through all of the times of turmoil. So, it's ironic that they're claiming that God is on their side as a justification for the enslaving of blacks.\u000a I think it's also ironic, though, that the blacks are the ones who receive the justification from a lot of the whites in the new world. At the end talking about John Quincy Adams, he says it was completely justified what the blacks did when they revolted and attacked the white slavers. The suffering that they had been enduring...\u000a And that's like the moment of irony.\u000a Yeah.\u000a The slavers are saying, "How paradoxical indeed that you whose wealth, whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves should suffer the august John Quincy Adams to speak with so much passion of the right of chattel slaves to kill their lawful masters..."\u000a "...And with his Roman rhetoric, weave a hero's garland for Cinquez." This is what I want you all to think about. Think about the historical connections here. John Quincy Adams, one of our founding fathers, fourth president of the United States was ultimately the man who got freedom or found freedom in court for Cinquez and the other slaves that were on the Amistad, which is a ship that, of course, being discussed in here. Think about these historical connections. I shall return. All right, group. What's going on?\u000a We're talking about a poem.\u000a You're talking about a poem? I'm going to talk about a poem, too.\u000a What a coincidence.\u000a I know. Isn't it coincidental? What's going on? What are you all discussing so far?\u000a We're looking for the marrow part.\u000a You're looking for the marrow part?\u000a Yeah.\u000a I'm glad you all have your "Beloveds" out and everything. What really interests me is the fact-- I think we have a real instance here where the 60 million or more to whom the book was dedicated. This is their story, is it not? What do you all think? How can we connect our reading of this poem to our reading of "Beloved?"\u000a In the second part, in the last paragraph, it says, "The fever is melting down my bones."\u000a Yes.\u000a Right now we're connecting that to Stamp Paid, who at some point had said that he was tired in his marrow, as in his bone marrow. We're looking for the page right now.\u000a Okay. Found it.\u000a Okay.\u000a And it's on this.\u000a Whoa. What is that? Read the passage to us.\u000a "'My marrow is tired', he thought. 'I've been tired all my days, bone tired but now it's in the marrow. It must be what Baby Suggs felt when she lay down and thought about color for the rest of her life.'"\u000a Okay. So, let's connect what you say in this stanza, you have, "I'd be trading still but for the fevers melting down my bones." What is it about that stanza that you want to connect to this allusion?\u000a We thought that her fever is melting down-- we thought that it was, it's pretty much the exact same connection because it's bones going into the marrow, so the outside going into the inside. "The fever is melting down to my bones," it's just taking a different way.\u000a And to get more than a physiological point of view here, the marrow is where? Where is the marrow?\u000a In your bones.\u000a It's like the core. So, Raphael, when we're suggesting that the marrow is being corrupted in some way, what does it mean for us?\u000a It basically means that the entirety of the whole of the being is being corrupted.\u000a Okay. So, in essence, then, from a symbolic point of view, just like in "Beloved," we can relate this to the poem. What kind of corruption do you see here?\u000a For me, it was mainly corruption of hypocrisy.\u000a Okay. Hypocrisy in what context?\u000a Mainly that the enslavers honestly believed that they were in the right, that they were different, like this passage, this short passage here. "It sickens me to think of what I saw, of how these apes throw overboard the butchered bodies of our men, true Christians all, like so much jetsam."\u000a Yes.\u000a And then at the very beginning, they're talking about how they're throwing slaves overboard.\u000a Or even when the slaves decide to, "Lost three this morning leaped with crazy laughter to the wading sharks, sang as they went under."\u000a Yeah.\u000a So, there's this sort of weird juxtaposition of the whites being thrown over by the savages or the apes at the end versus the slaves who choose to jump over at the beginning. Laura, what do you think is going on in this particular context?\u000a With all of the jumping off board, it's a true escape to eternal freedom, I guess if you believe in Heaven. The thing that confuses me is I understand why the savage blacks would throw the whites over, obviously death and more of a pain, but it also ends their misery in a way of staying on the ship with the slaves getting the sickness, the blindness and having to wait, I think it's like another three weeks before they come to port. So, it's really contrasting and interesting how it goes back and forth. This poem focuses, I think, on both sides, on black and white.\u000a Yes. It really does illustrate both. Which do you think is best illustrated, Laura, the black side or the white side?\u000a The black side is really, I don't want to say common, but it's similar to everything you hear about slave ships--\u000a And the slave trade.\u000a ...and the slave trade. So, I think it's interesting that Hayden decided to also put in the white side of it because you don't really focus on what came of slavery. Even though it was a horrible thing, on the last page here it says, "That you whose wealth, whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves," I thought it was interesting because I often fail to make the connection that through the slavery, we actually were able to grow as a country and through our liberty first, we were able to bring the slaves out eventually through the Civil War.\u000a Jordan, continue.\u000a I was looking at more of the religious side of it as with what you were just talking about. Here it says, "Their moaning is a prayer for death."\u000a Yes.\u000a "Some try to starve themselves." And then you go down one, two, three, four stanzas later, it says, "Jesus Savior pilot me over life's tempestuous sea. We pray that thou will grant, O Lord, safe passage to our vessels bringing heathen souls..." It's not so much praying for death, it's praying and knowing that Jesus can lead them to freedom forever and allow them out of...\u000a Who is praying for Jesus here, Jordan?\u000a The slaves.\u000a Really?\u000a That's how I took it.\u000a Okay. Did anybody here take it a different way?\u000a I took it as the sailors.\u000a Exactly. Good. Not that that's-- I think you're on to something in the sense that the religion of the slavers was eventually forced upon the slaves themselves. So, I think that they could be. So, I think there's a real sort of duality there.\u000a For this point in history they evangelized--\u000a Evangelized.\u000a They had already--\u000a Evangelized. Yes. It's a hard word to say.\u000a Africa. I know the Dutch, for example, had already been there.\u000a So, historically speaking then, Raphael, when you say it's the slavers that are the ones that are praying, what's ironic about all of this?\u000a That they're so much in the wrong and they don't see it all and that kind of hypocrisy.\u000a And they're looking for justification for their actions. Speaking of justification, what I want you to think about now for a few minutes-- I'm going to talk to the other group up front here-- why is it that the white side of things is all reported to us literally through almost a journalistic style? It's all quotes. It's all basically kind of like it's from a ship's log. So, think about this and I'm going to be back to talk to you about it. All right, group, what's going on?\u000a It's all going on.\u000a It's all going on? Okay. Tell me. What have we discussed?\u000a Everything.\u000a Everything? Tell me more.\u000a Well, we've discussed about how in this stanza, "That there was hardly room 'tween decks for half the sweltering cattle stowed spoon-fashion there; that some went mad of thirst and tore their flesh and sucked the blood. " That was talking about the capture of the Africans.\u000a Yes.\u000a Who wouldn't be so thirsty that they wouldn't tear open their own skin and drink their own blood.\u000a Which is just crazy in terms of the suffering.\u000a Yeah. And how that shows that in some way they were driven into some sorts of savagery. And yet in the next stanza, it talks about how the crew would lay with the--\u000a The Guinea Rose?\u000a Yeah.\u000a "The crew and cabin lusted with the comeliest of the savage girls kept naked in the cabins..." Okay. Well, let's talk about it for just a second. We have a real juxtaposition of pleasure and suffering. What do you think?\u000a Yeah. It's a real contrast between describing these people as sweltering cattle ripping their flesh open and then it goes right into how the crew, like, would sleep with these women.\u000a Exactly. They're fully taking advantage of them. Imagine being kept naked in a cabin for the whole journey.\u000a Yeah. It's a very big contrast because they are calling them animals.\u000a So, what happens after their lust? In the stanzas right before we begin section two of the poem, what details are we given about what happens to this specific crew?\u000a They abandon the ship.\u000a It goes up in flames.\u000a Exactly. So, it's basically set on fire and then what happens?\u000a

V Glue. Here we are.\u000a  Compression is really  Compression is really getting it.\u000a  Hey guys, what ya doin?\u000a Adding our stuff to this.\u000a Oh, I've been trying to tell you that this bridge holds one kilogram without breaking.\u000a  A thousand grams? Wow! That's really good.\u000a That's probably why you want us to have a railing.\u000a  Uh huh.\u000a So it doesn't just slide off.\u000a That's true, you do want to keep something on the bridge. Well, that's very good.\u000a And we're thinking about, it bends a lot, so we could do this.\u000a It's really bendy bendy.\u000a And you just broke it. Don't break it. The last time she just dropped it and it splattered all over the place.\u000a  Okay, so this is the roadway?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay, and then what's going to hold this up?\u000a We're trying to figure out everything. If we get all the pieces, and then trying to see what we can do to add it all together.\u000a Do we have, um, wait a minute, guys, we could have one of the railings on the front and the bottom. The top and bottom.\u000a Stick? Cause I was thinking we could put this on the bottom.\u000a Guys, like if we had one on the top and bottom, like on the movie, it would hold it down and up at the same time, keeping it flat.\u000a Hey, you know what we could do? We could make kind of like a T shape and then bend the top of the stick, and then glue it on that way.\u000a What would you glue that to? You say you're bending it into a T shape, okay so you'd have a T shape.\u000a Go like--\u000a  Okay.\u000a Try to bend that.\u000a  Hand me a book, we need to put more compression.\u000a I learned by that idea, if I put a book on it, it would keep the glue down, and it would keep it compressed.\u000a  We need more compression let's get a couple of books.\u000a Here's another one. Also, put a kilogram on it.\u000a Yes, you did put a kilogram on it, that's true.\u000a  I mean, like, on there.\u000a Oh, okay. So this rail that you have over here, that's a truss?\u000a And as soon as we add this.\u000a Is that going to be under or above the railway?\u000a We were deciding to go above.\u000a Cause it has to have a railing, and then below is optional.\u000a Okay, but how is it going to get attached?\u000a We were trying to figure out that.\u000a Okay. \u000a Now we just keep going.\u000a  Okay.  I will come back and check on you, all right?\u000a Okay, give me a couple Popsicle sticks, so I can put it underneath.\u000a Will we put them underneath the thing?\u000a  Oh, dang, dang, dang. \u000a  It's hard, because these right here, but only two places are touching.\u000a Oh, I see what you mean. I don't think it's overlapping, because there's the one in between\u000a  I was just making sure, okay.\u000a Yeah, I see what you're saying, but I kinda think they work, because this is really only touching this, and here it touches this one, but it's not like it's continuously touching from here to here.\u000a  I was just making sure, sheesh you guys.\u000a  Why don't you all tell me more about your bridge?\u000a  Well, it's kinda a mix between an arch bridge and just a regular bridge, I mean beam bridge.\u000a Okay, can you sit up?\u000a We're continuing to make our arch, but we have run into a problem.\u000a Okay.\u000a We decided we're going to put glue on top of here, to fill in some of the cracks that we had.\u000a It would act like cement, but we forgot that when glue dries, it contracts.\u000a So, the bridge has kind of curled.\u000a  Guys, guys.\u000a Logan, we're not in your group, we're okay.\u000a Also, I was thinking, when we did the arch, it might need support under the bottom, but the triangle might be a little odd, cause it would stand on this end part.\u000a  We could do what we did here.\u000a Can you get the popsicle stick to be the shape you want it to be?\u000a Well, I was thinking we could just, like, bend it, and put it on that.\u000a I'm going to test this on the weights\u000a We need two kilograms, if you can get it.\u000a  Now, how long is your bridge? Have you measured your bridge?\u000a Our bridge is--\u000a  Are you doing it in metric, or in customary?\u000a We're doing it in customary.\u000a  Customary, okay.\u000a It's 55 cm, or 22 inches and 2 cm. \u000a  Okay, we're not going to mix measurements.\u000a It's like, 22 and a half inches.\u000a  Okay. So if you had 12, is that 12 plus 9?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So 21 and a half maybe?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay.\u000a You guys, I got the two 200 kilogram things, so we could--\u000a Gram?\u000a I said gram.\u000a  200 grams.\u000a It will be heavier than the glue bottle.\u000a And that way we can use the glue.\u000a Okay, so this is the bridgeway where the cars are going to go? The arch is going to be above the roadway.\u000a No, because, here you can't fit two cars, but it will go smoothly for the rest of it. Like, we made it so two cars would go right next to each other, like we didn't think we could leave the extra space.\u000a Right, but they might take off each other's rear-view mirrors. \u000a Right.\u000a We ran into that, though.\u000a What could you do about that?\u000a We don't really know, because all of this stuff is dry, so far it's holding up quite well.\u000a Well, what if this was only one lane? What if you made another one just like it to be the other lane?\u000a  That would be perfect.\u000a But it would take a good long while.\u000a  No it wouldn't. We built this in a couple of days. Yeah, we could glue it together with like these.\u000a Yeah, okay.\u000a Perfect.\u000a Thanks Miss Hoyle. All right guys, let's start working on that one. So are these the same size as these? Let's try to make it more even this time.\u000a Making that is going to take, like 50 days.\u000a We need 50 of these guys, right?\u000a  Tell me a little bit about this arch and what it's going to do. As you build the arch, how is that going to keep your bridge steady?\u000a Well, it's like, when the arch gets pulled on, it's gonna be secured here, so instead of the bridge itself getting the tension, it's going to go a little bit like it is now.\u000a Okay, it's going to pull it away?\u000a A little bit. Which means I've got to get the weight on it.\u000a So it's going to create the outward thrust?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Which with an outward thrust, what do you need to have on the sides of the bridge, if you have an outward thrust? Remember?\u000a Oh, it's, uh\u000a Abutments, do you remember that?\u000a Yeah.\u000a You need that, something over here to take the force, the pressure that's being exerted from the center outward.  the outward thrust.\u000a I have a thing with that one, it hates me, I hate it.\u000a So have you tried laying your bridge across a 20-inch span?\u000a Yeah, we did it on a desk \u000a It caved in a little in the middle, but when our arched is finished, it'll actually help.\u000a Tell me why you feel like it caves in in the middle?\u000a The important thing is, what we did was, we put glue in between in to act like cement, to keep it together.\u000a Uh huh.\u000a Well, that made it curl a little bit, and so it was a little weaker in the middle, because that's where it was starting to bend.\u000a And also partially because it's, it's--\u000a We don't have a lot of support on the bottom, which makes the, um, its tension affected.\u000a I kind of suggested triangles at the bottom, but we haven't really done that yet.\u000a Yeah, that's because we haven't got the arch up yet. Oh, you mean on the bottom of the bridge.\u000a Yeah.\u000a That's a good idea. Well, we need to start working on it.\u000a All right, well I'll leave you alone, and I'll come back and check on you later, okay?\u000a Guys, we've got four of these. We need a lot more.\u000a All right then, well let's get going. I'm going to keep working on the arch, okay?\u000a Wait, wait, wait, that was part of the arch support.\u000a The first arch needs to get worked on. Could you guys make the second road, and I'll continue on the arch. It needs to get to get built  \u000a This idea isn't working.\u000a Maybe we should try to like add this on here, so that it doesn't like fall.\u000a Oh, okay.\u000a And that way the arch will stick to the top, and this arch will stick to the bottom.\u000a Do you girls want to try that?\u000a Sure, sure\u000a Also, I think it will hold maybe a little better because--\u000a  Nicky, it's not all like--\u000a This is just like that, it's still gonna kind of, it's still going to kind of stick to this, even if we had this idea, it'd be like that, it won't exactly hold that very well.\u000a Show me how it's going to be touching, like this, onto there?\u000a I think, yeah, well like,\u000a Like that, this way?\u000a Yeah, but like with this on top, so like that, and then this at the bottom.\u000a Okay.\u000a It will hold better now.\u000a Actually this is the right way here, right?\u000a Yes.\u000a It's like that, okay.\u000a Yes, and then, we also figured out, um when there's going to be 1000 grams on there, it broke in half.\u000a Oh no!\u000a This part, it kinda snapped.\u000a  It can hold 500.\u000a Yeah, it can hold 500\u000a It can hold 500 grams\u000a Yes, and 200.\u000a And 200 grams.\u000a Yes, so I don't--\u000a Oh you tried 700 grams also?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay.\u000a So that's not bad.\u000a It kinda snapped here, but, yeah so, um it might be a little more sturdy once we add the, like, underneath.\u000a Okay, the piers?\u000a We should add the piers in the middle, seriously.\u000a Well yeah, we can add it, like, side, middle, and side.\u000a I feel like we should do it, like, bang one on that side and one on the other\u000a Yeah, but it's still with the one on top \u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah.\u000a We definitely want it--\u000a Want it to hold.\u000a Yeah, definitely.\u000a Yes.\u000a  All right, I want to see what's going on over here. \u000a Right now working on the railing.\u000a  Okay.\u000a And Molly's doing that by, she gluing, she's working on the sidewalk right now, we're almost done with the railing.\u000a  Okay.\u000a And what Molly's doing right now, is she is, we're gluing two popsicle sticks together like this.\u000a  Okay.\u000a And, uh, we're going to glue them against here.\u000a  Okay.\u000a So they can, we're probably going to put another popsicle stick like this in the middle, so they glue together easily. Glue them right here to the side.\u000a Okay.\u000a And then we're going to put the railing on the side of this, so like on this side, like this and then the railing will be on this side, so that'll, the railing is three inches, Brooke said.\u000a Right\u000a So, we're almost done with our bridge stuff at this--\u000a Would it be helpful to work from the bottom, to glue the pedestrian bridge, would it be helpful to work on it from the bottom.\u000a Yeah, probably would.\u000a And even though it bends, it's bent, it's really, really strong.\u000a Uh huh.\u000a It can hold more than a kilogram.\u000a Oh that's wonderful. Now did you, um, what kind of force, what do we call it when the bridge is bending like that in the middle?\u000a Um, it's compression and tension. Tension is pushing it out, like this, making the sides curl up, and then the compression is what makes the bridge \u000a Okay, so you're going to compensate for that like this. So are these your trusses?\u000a No, these are the railings. We thought that it would act like a truss.\u000a Okay.\u000a Even though we're not going to have one going on the bottom\u000a They're going to be on the top? It's all going to be on top.\u000a And you did try laying it across a 20-inch gap? \u000a We measured it to make sure it's 20 inches.\u000a Okay, good, well do want to try measuring a 20-inch gap between a couple of desks and just seeing what it, not while it's wet, but when it's dry? See what it's like. What are you doing Molly?\u000a I'm gluing the popsicle sticks together for the start of the sidewalk, and then when it's dry, I'm going to get them to go together like that.\u000a Okay. and then I'm going to take my railing. How's that going to attach?\u000a With another popsicle straight up and down attaching the railing to the sidewalk. And then just attach the whole thing to the bridge, as one piece.\u000a Okay.  I was thinking that you guys should take popsicle sticks and put them across the top, connecting the two railings together, with popsicle sticks at the top.\u000a  Like a covered bridge?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a So this is for a crab run bridge, is that what it's called?\u000a  Yes.\u000a That's a real bridge that needs to be replaced, isn't it?\u000a Yes.\u000a And we've actually figured out what's it's going to be replaced by.\u000a  Oh, okay, you found it on the internet?\u000a It's actually, it's um, a beam bridge. But it's not over water, it's over rough terrain.\u000a  Okay. And it's in Highland County, it's way to the--\u000a  It's northwest.\u000a

V But you're putting children in your sweatshops.\u000a How are you gonna get more money? How are you gonna finance the country still?\u000a Both of you need to listen to Cambodia. Because Cambodia...\u000a I am awesome, Cambodia is awesome!\u000a What are you doing to fix this?\u000a Well, for the money problem, I'm not really sure, but you can get loans for other wealthier countries and then as you're getting better, pay 'em off and then for, and then for child labor, you make a law that kids have to go to school and learn, so that way they can get better skills and stuff. And then put their, after that works and everything to age laws. I'm the only one with an answer!\u000a I have no child labor whatsoever.\u000a Whoa, whoa, whoa, I thought we discussed that you do have child labor, but...\u000a Well, we do have some child labor but it's more the grits going in and making your child choose the forms to get hired.\u000a So, what do I win as the only one with an answer?\u000a How did you pull your country off child labor? You need to be giving them suggestions and ideas, OK, what can we do, what can we do to crack...\u000a You told us some solutions the other day.\u000a Right, so that's why you guys are supposed to be discussing now.\u000a OK. China do you wanna go ahead and...\u000a So, China, you know how to get rid of all your child labor in your country? You have a plan, you have your whole plan in place...\u000a Pretty much.\u000a What's the first step, what's the second step, what's the third step, what you're gonna do.\u000a Yeah, you wanna hear it?\u000a I do.\u000a First, we'll make it illegal for children to work all day. And the other half they go to school...\u000a OK, but wait a minute, but don't your parents, your families depend on that income that those children are bringing in?\u000a Yes, but if they work half the day, while they're at school, they still earn money.\u000a But then they're losing half their income.\u000a But then on weekends they can.\u000a But they work weekends right now, anyway.\u000a Maybe we could establish a minimum wage over there.\u000a Oh! Now there's an idea!\u000a What?\u000a They could establish a minimum wage.\u000a Yeah.\u000a OK, so you're gonna establish a minimum wage.\u000a Yes, and going to school to get a education helps them get better jobs when they're employed so they can get more money with better jobs, so then they don't have that issue...\u000a So what are you going to do in the process, because you are gonna have to have children leaving the workforce, just starting to get their education that takes several years for that generation to become educated, what are you gonna do in that gap? You still have to have a plan for those 12, 13, 14 years.\u000a What about programs like those they used in like the de, de, depression, that's the word!\u000a OK, that's what you guys should be discussing, those are some of the things you should be coming up with.\u000a They could start...\u000a Keep in mind that needs money.\u000a But then they would get loans from wealthier countries, and as they're getting stronger and more...\u000a OK, take those ideas and work with them. You guys are on the right track, you're rolling with it.\u000a So, put that down, establish a minimum wage...\u000a OK, Cameroon, what was your solution...\u000a Say the children stop working, and the adults get it, well it would be taking money away from the family. Not other than the ones we came up with on Friday, like have countries send money.\u000a What about that like education like half school half work campaign, it's like where where you're working, part of your wages pay for your school and then you take the rest home\u000a And then, like, with me, in my country, already go to school. So, I guess all those times you mentioned. But they only go for like six years, from age 7 to... Wait, I don't know.\u000a  OK, anyway, that would help with like the country being...\u000a France for the win! Like the same thing but more...\u000a Coffee, OK, if it was our major export it would get rid of poverty and many things.\u000a Where's your country? Where's your country? OK, never mind. I was thinking you move at the same time, but no.\u000a If we work together with the coffee export, like... If we combine the export... If we produce... Well, I meant like from whatever we sell, we could try to hawk them together, to help each other create better education...\u000a Y'all can combine your profits in coffee, and begin making schools.\u000a You have an industry that brings in a lot of potential money, correct?\u000a Right.\u000a OK, but remember, you don't sell that product to the customers, you're selling it to the businesses. But that's bringing money in to your businesses. It's the businesses that hire people and you create jobs. So you need to figure out a way to take that industry, that product and expand it, so that it's bringing more money and bringing more jobs. Which is gonna help because then you'll have adults, you have 45% income.\u000a We can combine it so that children who are of suitable ages can have jobs.\u000a What would be a suitable age?\u000a Eighteen.\u000a Eighteen? This mine is not an easy job, is it? It's hard work, it's dangerous down there. To have twelve-year-old kids down there...\u000a You're still United Nations, correct? Is that gonna be agreeable to you? You can create laws that forbid businesses from running her product. So whatever she suggests to you, you have to make sure that that's OK, because, remember, you can tell her, sorry it's not gonna happen.\u000a Yup.\u000a Which means you have more money going out than coming in, correct? So you need to figure out a way to change that. You need some money coming in. So what are the strengths your country has? That you could potentially build and grow, when she's got the diamonds.\u000a I saw a pendant on the internet, and it had like, a string and there was like three fat fond doves on one string.\u000a OK, that's a factory purchase, but what you could make...\u000a I don't know.\u000a That's what you need to know. What does your economy depend on? I mean, you have to produce something.\u000a It says making foreign... OK, I have a question, what is a "foreign exchange?"\u000a It's Nestea's largest exporter, so you are exporting product. So you do have some products that you're exporting. Oh, you're Taiwan? You have a lot of textile factories, you make clothing. Your country's the one that's got all the sweatshops. So that's what you need, you need to build... You should be suggesting some ideas to her. Giving her ideas, say, OK, you've got a product to export, but you need to do this, and you need to do this, and you need to do this.\u000a  They need to find some way to pay.\u000a Exactly.\u000a Wait, I have a question for the United Nations. OK, how you said, setting up your steps, well if there's not a lot of educated people, then how are they gonna find teachers?\u000a Well, if you said, exactly... Well, first...\u000a You could hire people from...\u000a Different countries. Maybe if you like hired somebody from like the US that's educated, they could do administry of helping like educating adults and then they're educated. They're doing the same thing that kids are, they've been in child labor and stuff, plus when they got older, they're just working again, so they haven't really changed anything, so to change that, I guess, maybe if you got other countries to come and educate them and then after that they could the educate the children. So you couldn't get the kids out of the work so fast because you still have to educate all the teachers. And the kids have no where to go.\u000a Well, I say, since they're already adults, that we kinda like, work on the children more with education. I guess because the children are small.\u000a So, before you even take the kids out of these places You have to get all the people, and you have to... So you have to figure out some, like, you're gonna have to figure out a timespan of how long that's gonna take. It's basically, you're taking, elementary schools you like.\u000a I mean, they could set up a scholarship. That way they could go from like...\u000a And even, your country could help pay, help pay the people that are teaching. Because in the long run, you're gaining, that money's gonna be spent...\u000a The population is gonna face it, they get the cotton for the clothes, and get the food for their teachers and all that.\u000a If we can help poverty... To help pay for some schools.\u000a Yes, that would be amazing.\u000a We could also have all the adults work the rest of their life, like, insanely or something.\u000a I'm the government, I can say, hey, there's laws now that a kid's gotta go to school, and he can't work so many days of work, so many hours of work.\u000a

V Can you think of... what-what images are coming into your head about the Holocaust that relate to this?\u000a Um, people dying in the gas chambers\u000a Okay, and... and how did that happen?\u000a He convinced other people that they were awful, and then that's really the only way you can get people to do something as cruel as that.\u000a Okay, so you're saying Hitler couldn't have carried out all that evil himself so he had to convince other people that basically the Jewish people were what?\u000a Nothing\u000a They were just less than... just a lesser race of people\u000a You're on a good track, I'll check back with you in a second. \u000a ... by stepping on another group of people.\u000a So the other groups would actually help them.\u000a Like we have to remember that the injustice... the injustice is what causes us to want to go and help and restore justice and it's not just injustice anyway.\u000a you have to want to help and not just sit back and do nothing.\u000a Well outside people like in Atlanta and Birmingham, like, in there, like, in Birmingham were being persecuted while people in Atlanta weren't really doing anything.\u000a Well I mean, look what's happening today, I mean, we have a volunteer army and people are volunteering and going and trying to stop the injustice in Afghanistan and so that was practically the same thing as what Martin Luther King did for Alabama.\u000a So you're saying you see a connection in the real world news? That sort of our soldiers, the fact that they volunteer would be an example for number five? Is that what you are saying?\u000a Yeah\u000a Had y'all talked about number five yet?\u000a Uh, we were just going in order and seeing which ones that we could...\u000a And yours is... read me your quotation.\u000a Um, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."\u000a Okay good. Well you're just being to come up with things. Okay go ahead I'm just going to...\u000a Okay, so what's the first question?\u000a Explain the context in which, um, Martin Luther King said this and how it applies in that situation.\u000a Okay\u000a He doesn't want people to sit back and not do anything about a problem, he wants them to go and help and stop...\u000a It's almost as if their problem is his problem-\u000a Is his problem.\u000a Good, I like that.\u000a But even though he wants them to help, well he doesn't want them to do it in a violent way.\u000a Always need to underguard MLK with that, don't we?\u000a And that sort of ties into "It's wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends."\u000a Do you find yourself, as you're discussing any one of these, the others layer on there?\u000a Yeah\u000a That's why it feels so important to have gotten this whole document as a whole. Think you've gotten enough from them, Brianna, for that one?\u000a Yeah, I think so.\u000a Well I guess Clyde's already said that, there's already one for the current news--\u000a Yeah\u000a ... that we could put down.\u000a So the volunteer soldiers.\u000a Volunteer army.\u000a Volunteer army.\u000a I'll check back with y'all, good job.\u000a ... are they more reluctant to, like, um, listen to the lower class bunnies cause they felt like they had a better rule of it.\u000a Yeah I think that's it.\u000a Okay, so in Watership Down, the higher class rabbits did not want to give up their superior... how do you spell that because I think I spelled that before... privileges\u000a Privileges? You know what, to be honest with you every time I am typing, I let spell-check do it because that d and g always messes me up\u000a I was spelling superiority.\u000a Superiority, I'm sorry. Okay, so what group have you chosen Colleen? and what... what... ?\u000a Uh, privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily and groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.\u000a And I hear that you're using a Watership Down example, which-\u000a My idea.\u000a Your idea, good for you! And what is the, um, what Warren are we talking about?\u000a The very first one, um.\u000a Sandleform.\u000a Sandleform, yeah.\u000a Yeah, go ahead and tell me about that.\u000a Yeah, it's like, um, the higher class rabbits didn't want to give up their privileges of superiority to listen to the lower bunnies. \u000a Does that make sense to you, India? That's a good example, I really like it! Okay, have you gotten anything else?\u000a Um, we did the one about the time in history where this quotation applies?\u000a What was the time in history, Bish?\u000a Um...\u000a Number two.\u000a Where this quotation applies is the Holocaust. Um, during Nazi rule, people felt better about discriminating against the Jews because many others were also doing it.\u000a So what was the privileged group that were reluctant to give up its privileges?\u000a Um, actually I think this one was grouped to be more of an individuals rights.\u000a Right, so the whole group of what?\u000a The whole group of, um...\u000a Nazis.\u000a ... the Nazis and the pretty much anyone that favored Hitler and the Nazis.\u000a But maybe they wouldn't have carried out those atrocities alone but kind of got into a mob mentality, is that kind of where  we are with this?\u000a Yes.\u000a Good, well y'all go ahead, I'm just going to watch a minute\u000a So...\u000a I'll finish writing the Watership Down one... the higher class rabbits did not want to give up their superiority to... how about... admit that some of the lower\u000a Number four would be easier to connect to a teenager's life... that one actually fits for both of those.\u000a What does?\u000a Um, for telling a time in a teenager's life, um, both of these, the two parts of the quote would apply because it's like, when you're getting, like, verbally abused, it feels much worse coming from a group than it does from an individual.  So if there's a whole group picking on you, then that makes it worse and the privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. So say, say someone has a good cafeteria lunch table and someone who's sitting over by the garbage cans wants to move over there, so they ask, "Hey you don't have to sit over at our table, but can you move somewhere else so we can sit there just for a day." They'll probably say "No" because they won't think of another place to go besides that table that those other people left.\u000a And they don't want to go by the garbage cans.\u000a Nobody wants to.\u000a I think that's a good connection. A good, very present day connection. Good, I'll be back. Yes of course\u000a Um, Allison, would you like to?\u000a I have no clue, would it be okay to write about, like, how people in foreign countries use, like, the sex trade as an "it," an I-it relationship?\u000a Certainly.\u000a Mr. Gallant's class.\u000a We just had to make sure it was all right with you before we started just writing it down.\u000a That's okay, that's okay, that seems very real to me. Okay\u000a ... fictional things, so if it's fictional, it doesn't have to be people\u000a I didn't say that we could use, um, what's that, Watership Down, I said we could use that, did I not?\u000a All right, let's see...\u000a Okay, whatever.\u000a I said we can use Hazel and the Warren for oppressed people that are not...\u000a But I think we should do Efrafa because the bunnies, like, revolted and they got free remember?\u000a Yeah.\u000a That's what I'm thinking.\u000a I'm hearing an argument where both of you think Watership would be a good connection but we're debating which what?\u000a Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever.\u000a Which Warren would like... be better\u000a I think Efrafa.\u000a Which one did you say?\u000a Um, the first one that came to from... what was it called...\u000a  Sandleford.\u000a Sandleford.\u000a Okay, tell me why you think that.\u000a Because they were, they had freedom, but it was like they were just, they couldn't do what they wanted all the time. They could just do certain things in a certain vicinity. They couldn't go out or go anywhere, and they were just stuck against their will for that long of a time until they, um, like, revolted against their Warren and left.\u000a What were you going to add, Michael?\u000a Oh, like it was like a routine everyday, like, it was the same thing, they followed like a routine, like they went out and then ate and then slept\u000a But I think Efrafa is like that except for it's a lot worse, like they didn't even get to go out, like they got like feeding times and they would have to feed, like, right here and they'd have to go right back into their Warren.\u000a I think they're both good examples, but I think Machi's is more able to be explained by that because they did, but in his, you know, uh, uh, Hazel and Big-Wig and all them broke away and then they went to go search for...\u000a They eventually got what they wanted. In Efrafa they didn't get what they wanted until someone came in to...\u000a And not everybody in Efrafa got out.\u000a But not everyone in, um, Sandleford got out, most of them didn't.\u000a But I mean the group that we're talking about, the main...\u000a But the main characters got out and achieved what they wanted, where they wanted.\u000a Because no one else would listen.\u000a Let me tell you something, the main reason we're doing this is so that these quotations and these philosophies and that kind of thing, will inform our later life. It doesn't make me sad that you have two examples because when it's a little bit wrong, or when it's a lot wrong because when you notice it when it's a little bit wrong sometimes you can keep it from getting a lot wrong, so it kind of pleases me that you're seeing it at two different levels, so I think use Efrafa and Sandleford, and you'll have the best answer, Okay? Okay, what are we working on?\u000a We are trying to debate whether we should pick Cuba or Egypt as current events for-\u000a ... for privileged groups so we can get...\u000a Well, let's hear your arguments.\u000a Cuba, Fidel Castro has been a tyrant for\u000a Metaphorically, he's about to die.\u000a He's still in power, okay? Egypt's been resolved already.\u000a No.\u000a Well, they're arguing that it's not in the news but it's going on right now.\u000a Well I think it would be best if we did something that was going on in the news that we've like talked about in class that's really really really...\u000a And we all understand it.\u000a What don't you understand about Cuba though?\u000a Like there's nothing that's really in the news right now\u000a Cuba, they still have the same old thing just like every other country that's happened, just a little bit worse.\u000a Here's what I'm hearing. You have a great example but your group is wanting to go with the Egypt example, and it doesn't dis, uh, disvalue yours because it's important to be able to understand that it can happen over a long time and sometimes when he's talking about apathy, when it's happened for a long time, people don't, less and less and less, revolt, Okay?\u000a Could we possibly do Cuba in the history one?\u000a Oh I think you could! Work on that, that's a great idea. How are we coming?\u000a Good, we're done.\u000a Good, done\u000a I think we are finished.\u000a I want to hear your, uh, everyday life one.\u000a All right, our, for our teenager?\u000a Yes.\u000a All right, we're saying, like, if there's a group of popular kids and they're like calling names and putting down a group of the not-so-popular kids and they're just not treating them like they're normal people too, they're just treating them like lesser people.\u000a Less than human?\u000a They might, they might not pay attention to them, also, they just...\u000a In the way you wouldn't necessarily recognize a theme, but in a way, you would never ignore a human or we would think should never ignore a human being. Okay, great. So I want you, as you're looking back over yours, make sure that you've given your reader or your listener enough information. My shortest one was like three sentences and there's nothing magic about the number of sentences, just check yours because you're a little ahead of everyone else for thoroughness and see if there's any details you could add. Okay great. How are we coming?\u000a Um, good.\u000a Pretty much done.\u000a Awesome, awesome. You've got three of the four? Which ones did you do?\u000a Um, the tell us a time in history when the quotation applies and the fiction quotation and the teenagers of life.\u000a And your quotation was?\u000a Oh, we did, um, it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends, the last temptation is the greatest treason to do the right deed for the wrong reasons.\u000a Thank y'all for choosing that one, that's a very hard one\u000a And we put .\u000a And the third one, great. Now will some body tell me what your fictional one was?\u000a Um, we did... why don't you explain this one Isabelle?\u000a Okay, I did Peter Pan.\u000a Uh-huh.\u000a 'Cause when Peter Pan, he persuades, or, he offers to take the children to the other place and it sounds wonderful to them, but he's doing it for the wrong reasons.\u000a What reasons do you think he's really doing it?\u000a To have a mother for the children, the lost children.\u000a And so he's not really thinking of their well-being, he's thinking of his and the lost boys' well-being.\u000a Right.\u000a What a great connection. I'm so proud of y'all! That's awesome! And did you do news?\u000a Uh, we did history.\u000a History, what's your historical one?\u000a Uh, we did, uh, when the Europeans-\u000a

V That's a start, ok, Devon and Sasha? 3 1/3, what are the classifications?\u000a  Natural.\u000a No, not natural.\u000a  Rational.\u000a Yes, rational.\u000a  Real.\u000a Yes.\u000a Ok, it's rational, and it's real. Now Brian, you had first said natural.\u000a Yeah, I kinda, because a fraction isn't natural.\u000a Ok, right, a fraction is not natural. Who else can tell us something about natural numbers then? What do we know about our natural numbers?\u000a They're the counting numbers.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Ok, counting numbers, what do we mean by that, the counting numbers?\u000a  Numbers that you count with?\u000a Like one, two, three.\u000a Ok, our natural numbers are our counting numbers. So 3 1/3, again, was just a--\u000a Rational.\u000a Rational and a--\u000a  Real.\u000a Ok, very good, somebody else. Ok go ahead, Natalie?\u000a Square root of 19. What are the classifications?\u000a  Rational.\u000a  Hold on one second, thank you. Can you show us your number? So the square root of 19. Ok.\u000a  Irrational?\u000a It's irrational, I decided.\u000a  It's irrational. 'Cause it's the square root of a nonperfect number.\u000a Nonperfect square.\u000a  Nonperfect square.\u000a Ok, so Sasha and Christina both agree that it's irrational, and Christina, what else did you say? I'm not sure if they heard.\u000a It's a nonperfect square.\u000a Ok, it's not a perfect square.\u000a  And it's also real.\u000a Ok, it is irrational, and, we wanna remember that, an irrational number is also a real number, even though it doesn't end or repeat. How did you know, without using your calculator, that the square root of 19 was an irrational number?\u000a It doesn't make a perfect square.\u000a Ok, and how do you know it doesn't make a perfect square?\u000a Because, I have no idea.\u000a If you multiply two numbers, you don't get it.\u000a Ok, very good, that's exactly right.\u000a You actually can multiply two numbers to get 19--\u000a It's just a decimal or--\u000a Yeah, it's an irrational decimal.\u000a It's an irrational decimal, ok. So you can multiply, and we looked at an example, of that, we did a little activity with the square root of 19. Is it gonna be two whole numbers that you could multiply, to get 19? Mm-mmm. And that's what makes it irrational. Compared with, if you did like the square root of 16, what two numbers can you multiply to get--\u000a  Four and four.\u000a Four and four, ok, good. Ok, how 'bout another number? Go ahead.\u000a The classifications of 1/3.\u000a Rational and real.\u000a Ok, rational, real. Anyone wanna throw in anything else about 1/3? Mm-hmm?\u000a The greater the decimal, it's repeating.\u000a  Right, it's a repeating decimal.\u000a It doesn't end, but it does repeat.\u000a  Ok, so if it were--\u000a If it was, you could get a rational number.\u000a Right, and that makes it a rational number, very good. Ok, we looked at several numbers. How about someone ask a question? Someone wanna throw in a question? Ok, go ahead Scotty.\u000a What integers are also whole numbers?\u000a Ok, what integers, and let's make sure everybody's having the opportunity to answer questions. Repeat that again.\u000a What integers are also whole numbers?\u000a Ok, so what integers are also whole numbers?\u000a  Two can be a whole and an integer.\u000a Ok, what did you say first?\u000a Two.\u000a  Ok, two is an example, it can be an integer and a whole number.\u000a  Positive numbers? Positive numbers?\u000a Ok, our positive numbers.\u000a  Negative numbers could be, too.\u000a  Can negative numbers be whole numbers though?\u000a  No.\u000a  No?\u000a It can, zero.\u000a Ok, zero.\u000a Positive numbers.\u000a Ok, who remembers, what example did I give you, when we're thinking about whole numbers?\u000a  Pets!\u000a What can help you think about whole numbers?\u000a Pets?\u000a Ok, Sasha says pets. Who can elaborate on what that means?\u000a The number of pets you have--\u000a Count the number of pets you have.\u000a And then we asked for a number or something. They wouldn't say, like I have 3/4 of a dog or something.\u000a Ok, so if you'd ask somebody how many pets they have, their answers are always gonna be what?\u000a  A whole number.\u000a A whole number, which, and what are our whole numbers?\u000a Zero, one.\u000a Zero to infinity.\u000a Zero through all the way.\u000a Ok, mm-hmm. Zero and all. Alright, good. Good question, Scotty. Let's have another question. Go ahead Luke.\u000a Is a negative number rational or irrational?\u000a Ok, turn that around so we can see. So is a negative number, can it be classified as rational, or irrational?\u000a  It would be a rational number?\u000a No.\u000a  A negative number is a rational number?\u000a It would be both.\u000a Yeah!\u000a It would be both.\u000a If you have the square root of a negative number.\u000a  It's an integer.\u000a Take the square root of a negative number.\u000a An integer is always rational, so--\u000a An integer is rational.\u000a And a negative number is a, is rational.\u000a But his question, let's see that again. Is a negative number, so it could be rational. Can we have a negative number that's irrational? Can somebody give me an example of that?\u000a Negative pi.\u000a  Ok, negative pi, mm-hmm.\u000a The negative square root of two?\u000a Ok, the negative square root of a number. Would the negative have to be on the outside, or the inside of the pi?\u000a  Outside.\u000a The pi?\u000a I mean, outside the square root sign. So Luke, can you conclude us, what was your answer to that question?\u000a Sometimes both.\u000a  Ok, it can be both. Mm-hmm, good. Alright, good question too. What about another number? What's another number? Madison, go ahead.\u000a The square root of 144.\u000a  Ok, the square root of 144, who can give us the different classifications?\u000a Real.\u000a Ok, Damian says real.\u000a Natural.\u000a  Natural.\u000a  Whole.\u000a Whole.\u000a Integer.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Integer. Any others?\u000a Rational.\u000a Ok, it's rational. Do you agree, Madison?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Ok, very good. So we looked at when that's, if we look at our graphic organizer, when it starts here with natural, we read this going out, that it has all those different classifications. Good. Ok, how about another number? Go ahead, Amy.\u000a What is the difference between these two numbers? The negative square root of nine, and the square root of negative nine.\u000a  Ok, I like that question. So what's the difference between those two? So on the first example, we see the negative on the outside of the square root sign, and then we see it on the inside.\u000a  One's real and one's not.\u000a  Ok, Damian says one's real, and one's not.\u000a When it's in the inside, it's not real. Because you can't take the square root of a negative number.\u000a Exactly, we cannot take the square root of a negative number. So when we see it on the inside, there's not a solution to it. What about when it's on the outside?\u000a You can take the square root of it and just add the negative sign.\u000a Ok, so what would that answer be, negative square root of nine?\u000a Negative three.\u000a Right, negative three. Let's talk a little bit more in depth about, when that negative is inside the square root, why do we not have a solution to that? So it was a square root of negative nine.\u000a Because you can't multiply two numbers to get a negative.\u000a Right, exactly. So if we had like the square root of nine, what two numbers can we multiply to give us--\u000a Three.\u000a Oh, nine, three and three.\u000a Three and three, and remember how we talked about, what is the inverse of taking the square root of a number?\u000a Squaring it?\u000a Mm-hmm. So there's not two numbers we can multiply to give us that negative nine, good. Alright, let's have another number. Go ahead Brock.\u000a Ok. 3.14, pi.\u000a  I'm glad you showed that number, 3.14.\u000a  That is not pi. It's rational and real.\u000a  It's irrational.\u000a  No, it's rational.\u000a It's not rational, because it never ends or repeats.\u000a  It is rational.\u000a  Yeah, but 3.14 ends.\u000a  Yes, it ends.\u000a  It's 3.14, not pi.\u000a  That's not pi. \u000a Pi doesn't end.\u000a  That one ends, pi doesn't end.\u000a Ok, so are we all in agreement that the number pi, is an irrational number that doesn't end or repeat?\u000a  Yes.\u000a But what is Brock's number?\u000a  3.14.\u000a 3.14, so that number, 3.14--\u000a  Ends.\u000a It ends. So, what are the classifications for that number?\u000a  Rational and real.\u000a It's rational and real. Now when we're working problems, like area, or circumference of a circle, why do we use 3.14?\u000a Because it's easier.\u000a  Because it's easier.\u000a Right, could we use a whole number for pi, to do a calculation?\u000a  No.\u000a No way it's gonna end.\u000a Right, it would never end. So when we're doing our calculations, we use that 3.14. But, Brock I'm glad you had that number, so, you know, there's that difference. Pi doesn't end, but just 3.14 does end. Mm-hmm?\u000a Square root of negative 41.\u000a Ok, can you show everyone your number? So the square root of negative 41.\u000a  Not real.\u000a Ok, not a real number.\u000a But if it was real, then, and they were on the outside, then it'd be irrational, wouldn't it?\u000a Ok, and why would that be irrational, the square root of 41?  Mm-hmm, no two numbers that can multiply. Not the same two whole numbers. Let me ask you a question about the square root of 41. What if your neighbor came and said, I'd like for you to help me, make a fenced-in area for my dog, and I want it to be a square, and I want the area to be 41. How would you maybe respond to your neighbor?\u000a Make it 49.\u000a Ok.\u000a 'Cause it wouldn't be a square.\u000a  It wouldn't be a perfect square.\u000a If it was 41? Ok, so you, what did you say Damian?\u000a To make it, like 41, so you could have a seven by, or 49, so you could have seven by seven.\u000a Ok, good.\u000a  Or make it a six by six, 36.\u000a Ok.\u000a I would tell him to make it way bigger, because a dog needs a lot of space.\u000a No that wouldn't actually be a very big area, would it?\u000a  No that would be small.\u000a Unless maybe it was a small dog.\u000a Yes.\u000a A really small dog, like a teacup chihuahua.\u000a Ok, how about another question?\u000a Oh!\u000a Ok.\u000a Are repeating decimals ever fractions?\u000a  No.\u000a Yes, 1/3.\u000a So you could have a repeating decimal as a fraction?\u000a Yeah, 1/3.\u000a Ok.\u000a 2/6.\u000a It's a bunch of threes.\u000a Yes.\u000a Ok, 1/3, definitely, that was the number Damian had, a bunch of threes. And you said, now two, what about 2/6?\u000a It's repeating also.\u000a Ok, 'cause that will reduce back to what?\u000a 1/3.\u000a 1/3, ok. Alright, how about another number? Ethan?\u000a Square root of two.\u000a Alright, I don't know if you can see that, but the square root of two. What if you try to take the square root of two?\u000a  It's irrational.\u000a Irrational.\u000a Ok, it's an irrational number, but it's also a...\u000a  Real.\u000a Real number, good, alright. Another number that we can look at? Maybe someone who's not answered. Down here? Nicole?\u000a Five divided by zero.\u000a Oh, that's a good one, we've not had that. How about five divided by zero.\u000a  It's not real.\u000a  That's not real.\u000a Ok, not a real number again. Can we go a little bit further? Why is that not a real number?\u000a Because there's no longer a number you can multiply by, it's zero.\u000a  Anything divided by zero is not a real number.\u000a Ok, I had several of you talking, and I do want to hear everyone. What did you say Natalie?\u000a It's undefined.\u000a  Ok, we do say that's undefined. Michael, could you add to that?\u000a You can't divide anything by zero.\u000a Ok, you can't divide anything by zero. And if you look on the overhead, if I were to write that out, and put five inside as our dividend, and zero as our divisor, is there a number I can multiply by zero to get five?\u000a No, 'cause anything times zero is zero.\u000a So that makes it undefined. Ok, very good. Ok, another number.\u000a Ooh! Ooh! \u000a Ok, Cliff go ahead, and then Brock, you had your hand raised, I'll come back to you.\u000a The square root of 53.\u000a Ok, hold that up so everyone can see. Ok, we have the square root of 53. Classifications for square root of 53.\u000a  Irrational.\u000a Irrational and...\u000a  Real.\u000a And real, very good. Ok Brock, how about your number?\u000a Ok, the square root of a prime number is always what?\u000a  Ok, Brock's given us a question. Can you repeat that again?\u000a The square root of a prime number is always what?\u000a  Oh, that's a very good question.\u000a  Irrational.\u000a Ok, so if it's a prime number, and you're trying to take the square root, it's always irrational. Ethan, you said irrational, can you expand on that?\u000a I said the square root of a prime number will always be irrational because you cannot make a square out of a prime number, you have to have two, for it to be a perfect square. You have to have two numbers, prime numbers, and you have one, and the number itself.\u000a  Ok, only those two factors, right. Ok, very good. Ok, maybe another question. Mm-hmm.\u000a Is a repeating decimal rational or irrational?\u000a So if it's a repeating decimal.\u000a  Rational.\u000a Rational?\u000a Yes.\u000a Ok, very good, how about another question, that we could discuss? Madison?\u000a True or false: a terminating decimal means the decimal repeats.\u000a  It's false.\u000a Ok, it's false. What does that mean, Mariah, if it's terminating?\u000a It...\u000a So if it terminates, it--\u000a It ends.\u000a It ends, right, exactly. Ok, how about another number? Anyone, an example, we've not had many with integers. I see you. How about one with a negative number? Anybody have one with a negative number? Brian, you do? Ok.\u000a I have the square root of negative 225.\u000a  Not real.\u000a Ok, not real, again, why is that not a real number?\u000a Because it's negative.\u000a  The decimal's inside.\u000a Ok, well not the decimal is inside but the--\u000a  Negative.\u000a The negative's inside. I wanna throw a number out. How about negative 4/5? For the number negative 4/5.\u000a  Rational?\u000a  Yeah, rational.\u000a Ok, it's a rational number and it is a--\u000a  Real number.\u000a Is it a negative number?\u000a Yes.\u000a No!\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  No?\u000a Hmmm. So negative 4/5. Wouldn't that be considered an integer?\u000a  No.\u000a Because it's not a whole or a natural number.\u000a Ok, very good. What do we know, we haven't talked too much about integers. What do we know about our integers? How do we classify an integer?\u000a That it's whole numbers and their opposites?\u000a Ok, whole numbers and their opposites. And we used our number line in class. Do we have any fractions or decimals on our number line?\u000a  No.\u000a So what numbers are not considered integers?\u000a  Decimals.\u000a Decimals and...\u000a  Fractions.\u000a Ok, so if they have that negative sign in front of them, then what do we call em? If they're not integers.\u000a

V Now, what you just did was count how many times you made a successful... Eric... ...you made a successful throw and how many times you made a successful catch, out of 10. All right, we're going to use that information that you just gathered to answer the questions on this form that you've got. You each should have your own reflection sheet, all right, and I'm going to allow you to as a group, as a partnership, I'm going to allow you to talk about the answers together, which is just fine, because with your partner helping you, you might learn something about your throwing ability, or catching ability, that you might not have picked up on your own. All right so...  Now, if you look at the backside, if you start here,  each of you should have your sheet in front of you, OK and you should have a pencil or you have  and I'm going to read this to you to help you best understand it. This is a chart to help you gauge your abilities and for your progress from the start of throwing the Frisbee up to this point. It's broken up into four categories. One, you see where I'm pointing at here. It says, Beginning; Two, Developing; Three, Proficient; and Four, Excellent. So the question you have to ask yourself is, "Am I still in beginning stages of throwing Frisbee?" In other words, do I use correct Frisbee throwing form sometimes? Two, it says, "Do I use correct form "some to most of the time?" Three, proficient. Do I use correct form when throwing the Frisbee or catching the Frisbee most of the time? And four, excellent. Do I use correct form all of the time? All right. So this is what you are going to test yourself on. I'll read it to you, and as I read it to you I want you to mark the boxes. Again, you can talk to your partner and make this assessment with your partner if you'd like. So sitting with your partner, you're talking about it. I'm going to read it as we go. Number one, movement. Do you move to meet the Frisbee's expected location? Are you at the beginning stages of that, developing stages, proficient stages, or are you excellent at it? Do you always move to meet the Frisbee's location? Sometimes, most of the time, or rarely? Give yourself a check in the box of where you think that belongs. Body position. OK, this is how you position yourself to the oncoming Frisbee aside from moving to it, this is how you square your body with it. Are you in the beginning stages, where you rarely do it well, are you in the developing stages, where you do it sometimes, the proficient stages, where you do it most of the time, or are you in the excellent stage where you do it all of the time? Ask yourself that question. Feel free to discuss it with your partner. All right, so you should be checking the boxes. You should be checking the boxes. That's right there.\u000a  The boxes are already checked.\u000a Next, Hand position. When catching the Frisbee, do you use proper hand positioning with your palms together, fingers opening, rarely? That makes you in the beginning stage. Sometimes? That's your developing stage. Do you do it most of the time? That puts you in the proficient stage. Do you do it always? That puts you in the excellent stage. What do you think? What is your target? What would you put a grade on? Now when it comes to the throwing, the same things apply. Your stance and your elbow. Are you at the beginning? And I'm not going to go into detail with each one of these now, I think you get the idea of how these check . Are you at the beginning stage, the developing stage, the proficient stage, or the excellent stage? When it comes to your stance and your elbow position. When it comes to wrist snap and point OK what stage are you at? Are you rarely, sometimes, mostly, or always? Again, beginning, developing, proficient, or excellent? And then lastly, when it comes to releasing the Frisbee what stage do you think you're at: the beginning, the developing, the proficient, or the excellent? So I want you to just think about that reflect on that, but I'm not grading you on this. I'm not grading you on your ability. Hey, Mike, would you sit up for me? Thanks bud. I want you just to reflect on what you have learned and your ability. All right? Now, with your partner, I want you to turn the page over and it says Frisbee throw reflections, OK, and then we have some questions that we need to answer. We discussed what angular momentum was, we discussed what force absorption was, and we discussed what force reduction was. With your partner, I want you to answer those questions that you see, one through seven. Number one: why is angular momentum important? Two: describe force reduction. Three: describe force absorption. Four: considering... You don't have to do this... I'm just reading them out loud before you do it. Considering the fitness components of speed, agility, endurance, and balance, to which sports would you compare Ultimate Frisbee? If you think about when we were playing Ultimate, the game of Ultimate, what sports would you compare that to?\u000a  Football!\u000a No, you have... do it with your partner. And a couple more questions. Where can Frisbee be played for fun? What are two popular Frisbee activities that you are aware of? You already know one that we played in class. You might know of another two. And then lastly, based on the activity you did just before we sat here, how many times did you catch your Frisbee out of 10 and how many times did you accurately throw the Frisbee out of 10? OK? So go ahead with your partner and go ahead and start answering those questions to the best of your ability. You guys should be working off one another and sharing your answers, ready, set, go. \u000a  Do we basically \u000a No, just rewrite it.\u000a  Force absorption?\u000a You absorb the force when you . Describe force absorption.\u000a  \u000a Yeah, OK, start with that and maybe go a little farther and describe what makes it...\u000a, To learn today. We're going to begin a unit on indoor ultimate frisbee, and we've got the indoor, soft styrofoam frisbee, all right? One thing about the frisbee I want you to understand, number one, it's styrofoam. That means you can easily break them. All right, please don't bend them like I'm doing here any more than I just did. Obviously, tugging on them, pulling them, poking them is going to harm the frisbee. You want it to be intact, so just use the frisbee as it's meant to be used, and don't play with it in any other way, okay? So that way we keep the frisbee in good shape. Now, here is the question we want to answer: why do frisbees fly? A lot of different reasons, and a lot of these reasons have to do with the concept of flight. All right, like an airplane, like a helicopter, or a paper airplane, okay? Now, frisbee flight's a little different than some other types of flight. Firstly we're going to look at this: angular momentum, big word, but the concept of angular momentum essentially means that frisbees fly, one of the reasons why frisbees fly and maintain stability in flight is because they spin. So, the fact that the frisbees spin is called angular momentum. All right, and again, that's what produces stability in the air. You find angular momentum in a lot of things. You guys ever use a top, a spinning top?\u000a  Yes, at home.\u000a That's an act of a football as a top. If I just balance this football, it'll fall, right? It doesn't remain upright. But, when I spin the football like a top, it maintains its upright position. That is angular momentum. That is why it does not fall down. The force of friction will eventually slow down the football, and that's why it will topple over and fall, but while it's spinning, angular momentum is what keeps it up. When a frisbee spins, the reason why it doesn't wobble in flight and fall from the air is because it's supposed to spin, as you can see there, and that's what keeps it stable. That's also what helps us to throw it accurately. Another concept is angular lift. Angular lift, like an airplane. There's different pressures above and below the wing. These concepts are really complicated if you look into them in detail, but the basic gist of this concept is that there's a low pressure on top, and a high pressure on the bottom, and when I throw the airplane, that pressure difference is what gives it lift and allows it to fly, okay? Now, one thing I'm going to do before I throw this airplane is I'm going to use force. Force production, I produce force behind the plane and that allows it to fly. In the same way, I will produce force behind the frisbee, and that will allow it to fly. The other end is force absorption, which we'll talk about in just a minute. So again, aerodynamic lift is when the pressure differences allow this airplane to lift, and I'm going to produce force for that to happen.\u000a  Can I go get it?\u000a No, we'll leave that there, all right? Now, I need one person to demonstrate how to throw the frisbee properly. Julia, please.  I'll have you stand here, now watch. You're going to, listen, I'm going to go over this one time with you, and then you're going to use these checklists on the cones to teach one another how to do it properly. Now, I know a lot of you, listen, please. I know a lot of you would like when you do the frisbee, you can throw the frisbee, but there's one... The difference between really just throwing the frisbee and understanding how to throw the frisbee. Understanding the mechanics behind it, okay? So, the mechanics behind throwing a frisbee are just this: the mechanics behind a frisbee are this: number one, I need to know my target. Two, when throwing a frisbee, you step with the same foot. Not the opposite foot, like when you throw a baseball, but rather, I step with the same foot. I'm going to point my elbow at my target, I'm going to curl my wrist and bring the frisbee across my chest. Girls, I need you to pay attention. If you miss this instruction it's going to be more complicated later. So, I'm going to step towards my target, frisbee curled up to my chest, and then point my elbow at my target. Now, when I extend my elbow, I'm going to snap my wrist. That's going to create the spin that gives this one, two, three...\u000a  Angular momentum.\u000a Angular momentum. And that's what's going to give it stability. So, I'm going to step, point the elbow, snap the wrist, point to my target, produce force, and on the other end, what Julia's going to do, once I throw it, is she's going to use force absorption. She's going to catch it. Fundamentals of catching. Julia, what I'd like you to do is, square yourself with the frisbee. If the frisbee moves to your right, I want you to move to your right, okay? If it moves to your left, I want you to move to your left. Because you want to meet it, and square your body to it. And last, I want you to put your hands in this position, palms together and fingers out. All right, they don't have to be touching, but we're going to try to pancake the frisbee. All right, hopefully my throw goes well. Here we go. Step, elbow, oh, wrist snap, release. One more thing I forgot to mention, release it level with the ground. If I release it at an angle here, it's going to go up or down this way, if I release it at an angle here, it's going to go up or down this way. So, release it level, one more thing to remember. Ready? Step, nice try. Don't laugh, don't laugh. All right, I want you to try the same thing. I want you to step with the same foot, point your elbow in, and when you throw, throw it, point your finger at me, remember to release it level. You're ready, go. Yes! It's all right, you can grab it with one hand, there's no problem with that. That frisbee had good spin on it, all right. She released it, did she release it level?\u000a  No.\u000a No, that's why it bounced off the wall. One more time, step, elbow, wrist snap, point, release level. Good catch.\u000a  Nice one, dude!\u000a Here you go, you got it. Perfect. Now, I could have moved to the side a little bit to catch that frisbee, but I did a little reach, and that's okay, too. All right, so with your groups of four, remember, wait, wait, wait! You're going to coach your partner in throwing and catching, use the checklist on the cones. Ready, set, grab one frisbee, go.  \u000a Can I stand here?\u000a You and you, here. You're going to be here. You guys are all working together, you're going to hold this. Wait, wait, wait! There should be two on each cone, one person holding the cone. Stop, where's your partner? You're going to coach her throwing. You're going to go first, and I want you to catch it, and then throw it to her, and you're going to be catching, and every couple tries, we're going to switch. Okay, pick up your cone and coach. Pick up your cone...  You're the instructor, he's going to catch, right? All right. You're the instructor, you should watch her. \u000a One, two, three, frisbee!\u000a Make sure you're reading and helping!  All right, practice a couple times, and, three, stop! Stop, stop, stop. Now, with the catch, with the force absorption, okay? You're absorbing that throw, listen. I know that the throws aren't all going to be accurate, that's all the more reason why you have to move to where you think the frisbee's going to land, and meet the oncoming frisbee, okay? So, with your partner's help, coach's help, keep practicing, and we're going to switch in just a minute. Make sure you correct any improper technique.\u000a

V\u266a  \u266a Great job, thank you for playing along. It's so much nicer to play with live accompaniment than it is recorded. Your assignment, two weeks, be able to play an improvised solo in this key, in F concert utilizing the Dorian and Mixolydian scales. We'll leave in just a moment, just relax. Utilizing the Dorian and Mixolydian scales. I'll ask you to play live, on this Bosaladera. I also, want you to, outside of class, find a Latin piece of music, it doesn't have to be bossa nova, that you can play along with identifying the Dorian and the Mixolydian scale that fits that key. Pick a song that you can identify the key, and that you feel comfortable playing in that key, to bring back and play for us. I want a recording here so, you're going have to find a mp3, CD, DVD, something along that you can get to class. So you can share this information with each other, Questions? Time frame is two weeks. If you went through this quickly, tell your buddy how long you got and what you have to do, go. That's a great question, thank you. Yes, yes, do it in vibes, it will be wonderful. You can do this, it's in F scale, it's in F scale, is what it is. And I saw your results and they were outstanding. Very good, let's all grab an encore, thank you, and I will see you tomorrow.\u000a, Keep the rhythm sync. Soft. As we do our solos, here if you would take your pencils, and when you hear the soloists play, on these notes on the side of this changing. I want you to put a mark beside that change where you are. Put a count on it. Each rotation will be different. Sometimes they may play from the middle scale to the middle or the whole thing. Wherever you think that happens. I will be documenting it over here, too. All right. Today's volunteers are, beginning with the vibe player, and then we'll just go through the trumpets, the trombones, and saxes and those others who are assigned to play today. Here we go everybody got pencils ready? And one, one, two, three, four.  Here we go Rockville. On my mark. One, two, ready. . .  One, two, and one, two ready play. \u000a

V And why face changes are different at different pressures. And so I think that at a certain pressure, they're so close together that they aren't a gas anymore and they become a liquid.\u000a Cool.\u000a Because the difference between a liquid and a solid with the atoms is that the solids or, the difference between a liquid and a gas with the atoms is that the gases are more spread out. And the liquids can still move freely, but they're more close together, so.\u000a Okay.\u000a We thought that in a liquid, they can't move as freely as it can in gas.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Well, another gas has to expand, well it does expand to fill its container.\u000a Yeah. So does that have anything to do with how they move?\u000a Well, you said that some, tried to, sometimes they don't always expand as much as they can, but I think they do. My guess is probably the distance between the molecules is based on how big the space is 'cause you think of pressed gas.\u000a What are you guys all thinking about of what you're hearing?\u000a Well...\u000a Do things sound reasonable?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Is this a question that we need to maybe think about a little bit more? Just how spread out do things have to be to be a gas? At what point does that matter or not matter?\u000a Uh-huh.\u000a Okay.  We're gonna keep that one on the books for something we need to check into.\u000a, That's what I want you to do to prove to me that you understand that beyond just telling me what, you know, maybe the book would say. Beyond just a definition, right? If you're going down the right path here and you know what that is, I see you're making a nice Venn diagram here, comparing and contrasting, that's great. What I want you to do is on this sheet here, cause this is what you're going to need to present to the class in a couple minutes. Put down these thoughts, these words that you've got. You can even draw your Venn diagram on here. But, explain what that means. What does that mean, bubbles floating inside the lagoon? What does that mean? It's escaping off the top. When we think of matter, what do we actually think of in our heads? Conceptually we're thinking of a chunk of matter, a beaker of liquid, so there's some space and what else?  And what?  So matter has mass and volume. What's matter made up of?  Okay. Atoms, molecules. If it helps you, you can decide okay let's think of this in terms of water. Just so it's a known right? Okay, good. Yeah that's a good way to do that. So, draw some pictures. When you say it's escaping off the top, what does that look like? Okay, so try to get it into some visuals.\u000a  Okay.\u000a I'll come back. \u000a Matter, like I don't really understand.\u000a  The definition of heat?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, so what is heat? \u000a  It's what? \u000a Heat is like the transferring of energy from a warmer thing to a colder thing, right?\u000a  So you want to separate what something is from how it behaves? So you're saying heat is the transfer of energy. Transfer is how it behaves, right? What is it?\u000a  It's just energy.\u000a It's energy, right? So heat is a form of energy, and you're absolutely right. It can move around in the environment, between systems, in and out of the system  . So let's say you've got a beaker of water sitting on the counter and it's hot, right? It's sitting in a cold room. What do you expect to happen? What will happen to the temperature of the water, for example?\u000a It will .\u000a Okay, so the water will get colder and the air right around the beaker will get warmer til they level out?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, equilibrium, good. So, you understand that heat is energy. And you understand that it can move around. So the question here is how does adding heat energy, for example, matter cause changes to temperature and changes of state? So not that it does, but how? So, what you need to do is think about your ideas about matter. What is matter?\u000a Something with a mass or volume?\u000a  Occupies space, has mass or volume. You know. You just said it.\u000a Okay.\u000a  Yeah, see you know. Okay, matter has volume, it takes up space, right? And it also has what?\u000a  Mass. The property of mass. Do you guys have any kind of a conceptual model of matter, like if you think of it... Obviously this is matter right, but if you zoom in on that is there a way that you think about what matter is? Do you guys think of matter as being made up of smaller things?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Okay, atoms, molecules. What would happen if you had one atom and you add some energy to it? \u000a Remember this isn't rights or wrongs, this is what are you thinking right now so that you can make sense of this. So what if I have two atoms and I add more energy to them? What if I have hundreds of atoms and I make them all move faster?  Well, I mean that's what I'm asking you guys to think about as best you can. How would that occur?\u000a We said if the molecules have more energy and they move faster then that leads to...\u000a And they get warmer. Oh, that's the same thing as adding more energy right?\u000a Then they move faster and that leads to changes from liquid.\u000a  I would say add some pictures. I think you guys are thinking some good thoughts here about the structure of matter, what it's made of. So why don't you draw me some pictures of what that would look like in, say something that is changing state. Maybe take a chunk of something solid and then draw what you guys see, as being a series of steps, getting it from here to here. So start with a lump of solid matter, okay something like that. Take it all the way to a gas.\u000a  Okay.\u000a How do you see that matter.\u000a  Okay.\u000a Okay, alright, let me give you guys a couple minutes to do that.\u000a Start with an atom, and build like a box...\u000a  So folks, I want to take a couple more minutes and then have you guys share your thoughts with each other. \u000a  Theorizing is good. Why don't you draw me some pictures of what might be happening here? Yep? Did I take your pencil? I'm sorry . Okay we have a pencil thief. So, you're saying there's some specific temperature in which all phases can exist at the same time? Water would be evaporating, ice would be melting, and vapor would be condensing. So, I just want you to tell me a little bit more about your theory. How would that work in the environment in terms of the physical conditions that the ice and the water and the vapor would be under? Yesterday, we talked about some things that affect phase, what were they? What was one thing that we said affects what phase of matter something is in? Okay, temperature. Anything else?\u000a  Pressure.\u000a Pressure maybe so is there a way that you can describe to me in terms of pressure and temperature, and the matter itself, how that would work? Okay, you may need to mentally zoom in on matter. What is it, what is ice, what is water, what is gas? If you zoom in and we look at it beyond just a chunk, what do we see on the "inside"? What's it made up of at a very small level?  Does everybody here see matter as a collection of atoms or molecules? Like you can visualize that? So bring that in here. If you do that then show me how your theory would apply to that. Try. Okay?\u000a  Okay. How's that sound? Okay a couple more minutes.  Seems like you guys have gotten your thoughts wrapped around this, and you're working on presenting it? Okay. \u000a  How am I supposed to do this?\u000a Oh god, I can't draw cups.\u000a  Remember you have to explain to everyone what you're drawing's showing, so it doesn't have to be perfect.\u000a Oh, okay.\u000a Don't worry about perfection. You're gonna get to stand up there and say this is what I drew. And they just have to believe you.\u000a  Okay, that's how bad it's gonna be.\u000a  Okay, so there's like the water.\u000a  I think I have the difference between the molecules. \u000a Okay, so that shows that, that's gas and liquid. \u000a What is the big red arrow?\u000a  It's like going up out of the liquid--\u000a What's it?\u000a  The molecules.\u000a Okay, molecules.\u000a  Yeah, that's what this is supposed to be.\u000a So the only thing I would like for you guys to add to your explanation here is something about why, like why or how. What are the factors in the physical environment that are allowing or not allowing the things that you're drawing to happen?  That's up to you, what you think is making... I think that's quite good actually. That explains it to me really well. The things that you think are having an effect on what's actually going to or not going to happen.\u000a  Like this amazing flame?\u000a Like that amazing flame. So you might want to label that or make sure that you explain that.\u000a  Label it F-L-A-M-E. \u000a You've vibrated, those are actually quite good vibrations.\u000a  That's our gas.\u000a They're awfully close together. These are closer together here than they are here. Is that something that you intended?\u000a  No.\u000a  There supposed to be really spread out. \u000a It's up to you what you're going to write. I'm simply asking you a question because it seems like between liquid and gas they got closer together.\u000a  We didn't mean to do that. I can draw more.\u000a What do you think?  So, we've shown them closer together. Do we want to revise this or do you think it doesn't matter?  So they could be closer together?\u000a  They could be closer together as long as they're moving more.\u000a Okay.\u000a  So I think being like spreading out and occupying all space available.\u000a So if you're thinking that, you should include that somehow, and it seems like then you and Katelyn, and Ignesia's have different ideas about this. And that's important to acknowledge because those are two different things so we want to think about... What are you doing? Oh, you're adding to it. So, I hear Lindsey's saying that you thought they'd be more spread out, occupying more space and I hear you guys saying the spacing of them doesn't really matter. So that's worth thinking about, because that's two different ways of looking at this. That's two different ways of looking at this. Anyway, we don't need perfection right now. We need your initial thoughts, but somewhere I'd record that discrepancy. I would record here that you're still thinking about that issue. You think one thing, you guys think another. That's important. So you guys, I think I'd like to have groups... Don't worry if you're not totally done. I would just like groups to kind of explain what they've got so far. And we're going to go in numerical order. So I am going to ask everybody to come back to the tables though, and give your poster to one group member. Let's do that now. Don't worry if it's incomplete. This is a work in progress. Come on back to the tables. Don't worry if it's not finished. You get to explain it. And we're gonna keep these around so you can add to them. Come on back to the tables.\u000a I count two.\u000a Alright, so group one, I'm gonna have you guys come on up and hang up your poster. You guys let's load towards the front of the room so that we're all closer. You don't need all your stuff, just come on up and sit a little closer. Let's squeeze in, in all these front tables.  Yeah, you guys are gonna explain a little bit to us of what you're thinking was. So, everybody come on up as close as you can. Let's squeeze in at these tables. Let's get a couple people here, let's get a couple people here. Pull a chair on up. \u000a  Come on up. Somebody come sit here, somebody sit here. So, we've only got a little bit of time left and I want every group to have a chance to tell us a little bit about their thoughts. You guys may, on your pre-think sheets, take some notes. Remember this isn't about right or wrong. This is about how do we think we understand this system right now. And this is all leading towards trying to understand it more thoroughly and better and correctly by the end of the unit. So, their question, the first one is how does adding heat energy to a sample of matter cause changes of temperature and changes of state? So, you guys tell us a little bit about your thinking here?\u000a Okay, so we were thinking that something about adding heat would have to do with the boiling point and the freezing point. And we were also just listing facts that we knew that would probably help us determine about our question. We were thinking about specific heat. The equation for specific heat. Also, we said based on the specific heat of the substance, an amount of energy will raise the temperature by a certain amount, and we thought that was important.\u000a And it varies for the substance because each substance is like a difference between the heat. So if you add one it will raise one gram of a different substance by a certain degree, and then a different substance by a different amount.\u000a And we also thought about how solid, liquid, and gas, that it has to do with the change of space.\u000a And the solid, they're like locked in place but they're still vibrating a little bit. Then, if you add more energy we think it goes to a liquid, where there's more freedom of movement, but they're still sort of contained, and then in a gas.\u000a And in a gas the molecules will be occupying all space available and moving faster. And they're not like moving in a certain direction.\u000a What questions do you guys have for them, or comments about what they're thinking?\u000a Why would different materials have different specific heats?\u000a You don't have to know the answer. Does anyone have thoughts on that? Guesses? Maybe they're different what?\u000a  Different types of material, I mean substance.  \u000a So I think that maybe they have different specific heats because the atomic structure is different. So they can kind of collect heat differently.\u000a How does that sound to folks, reasonable? Is it true that atoms bond in different ways for different substances? Okay, so maybe that's something worth looking into as we study this and see why that, why that physical property of specific heat, why isn't it the same for everything?\u000a  And so we were actually still thinking in our gas drawing here, because you can see that we drew all the molecules, really close together compared to the solid and liquid I guess. And we weren't sure whether or not in a gas they could move freely. And it doesn't matter how spaced out they are as long as they can, they're not stuck in one space like solids are. They can just move wherever. Or whether they have to be more spaced out and so...\u000a  Didn't occupy the whole space.\u000a Do you guys have thoughts about that? What they're saying? Do you guys understand the point Katelyn's making? How far do they have to be to be a gas?\u000a Well I think that that's actually a lot like ours because we were thinking about pressure...\u000a

V Okay, so what we're doing, is you guys are trying to figure out which one of these invisible tapes yeah, is the best. So, the first thing you gotta do is come up with a nice question for your problem, that you want to solve. Sharonda you wanna share what you've come up with?\u000a Which tape is the strongest?\u000a Which tape is the strongest, okay. Now see that's good because you don't like... We were discussing earlier you don't wanna say which tape is the best, because you really don't know what does the best mean? Strongest, stickiest, longest lasting but I like it, which one's the strongest? Do you ladies have any ideas?\u000a I said it was Scotch. Well we were gonna hang the same amount of tape up the edge of the table and stick a marble to the other side and see how long it holds the marble for and that's how you can determine which one is the strongest.\u000a  Okay so y'all have marbles?\u000a I have.\u000a You got some marbles, that sounds fine. So you're gonna do a sort of a time test, which one can last longest okay. That might work. You might wanna do a little test run tomorrow because if it's something where their gonna sit there, the tape's gonna sit there with a marble on it for be able to get that done. So you might wanna think about maybe adding marbles to see which one can hold the most or do something to the tape to make it drop the marble. I don't know what that might be. We're gonna come up with some more creative ideas.\u000a I was gonna maybe cut like, like this tape is cut halfway into it, to see how long it will hold with the marble on it.\u000a  Oh, once it's been cut.\u000a Yeah.\u000a That would be good, okay. But, and again you have to make sure that you cut each tape the same distance. You gotta be fair. So what about, give me a passionate sample hypothesis that y'all came up with.\u000a If the Scotch tape is the strongest then the marble will stay on it longer.\u000a  If the Scotch tape is the strongest, then the marble will stick to it longer. So in your hypothesis you're mentioning the type of tape, and you're mentioning what you're measuring. Okay.\u000a I'm having trouble finding the group control experimental manipulator.\u000a Okay, remember think about your variables think about the, especially for your manipulated variable what you're changing between the groups.\u000a  The tape.\u000a Yeah the types of tape.\u000a I understand.\u000a Okay, I'll come back and we'll discuss the other ones. \u000a Alright guys, Josh,\u000a Sir?\u000a since y'all have already been working a little bit give me a sample question, what you're problem is, the question that you guys came up with.\u000a Our problem it was, which paper towel sucks up more water?\u000a  Okay so you ...\u000a Absorbs more water.\u000a Absorbs more water, or sucks up that's fine. We're just nice and simple, it means the same thing. So you guys are going straight for absorbency?\u000a  Yes sir.\u000a What about a hypothesis, Darren?\u000a If Brawny, Bounty and a name brand paper towel are tested then Brawny will absorb the most water.\u000a Nice and simple, nice and simple. See you mentioned all the different brands right in the beginning and then you picked one and said exactly what it would do better, absorb the most water. Okay, perfect. Now, have you got any idea how you're gonna test the absorbency? Any ideas about your procedure, what kind of method are you gonna follow, to figure out which one absorbs the most water?\u000a   We're gonna use water.\u000a What do you need with water?\u000a Like water, we need water.\u000a We need water, yeah.  We need water, but how are you gonna use the water to test it?\u000a  First we'll get a measurement of how much water we have in a container. And then we'll put the towel in the container and see how well it sucks up the water. To see if the level drops and we'll measure it from there.\u000a So you're saying put a known amount of water in some kind of container, and we've got tons of beakers we can use. Then put the paper towel in there, take it out. How long you gonna let it sit in there?\u000a  Like a minute.\u000a Well, you gotta know. You gotta come up with the time and it's gotta be right on. Cause you don't wanna leave Bounty in there for 10 seconds but Brawny for 40 seconds. That's not fair. You've gotta keep it equal. But that's the kind of stuff you've got to think about. You've got to be detailed. Alright, and then you're gonna measure what liquid is left in the container?\u000a  Yes.\u000a You can do that. Yeah, that'll work okay, nice and simple. So whichever one leaves the least amount of water behind should be the best as far as absorbency.\u000a  Yes.\u000a Okay.\u000a  For our procedure we're trying to think and like maybe you could put like three of the same stains on one sock and then test it without one.\u000a  You definitely need to use the same stain. You don't wanna have Zout going against coffee and Clorox fighting mud. That's definitely a good idea so, what kind of stains might you use?\u000a We'll use, what kind of  we got?\u000a We can use food coloring.\u000a  Yeah, food coloring.\u000a I actually have some food coloring.\u000a Or we could use,\u000a  I got some barbecue sauce.\u000a Barbecue sauce? As long as you do not eat it during the lab. That's fine, I like that. Because that's more natural, I mean.\u000a  Ketchup.\u000a And that's already measured for you, like in packets that may not be a bad idea.\u000a Or mustard.\u000a Maybe yeah, now if you're gonna do those kind of liquids we'll have to find a way to measure it.\u000a  We can use hot sauce.\u000a Or hot sauce. Okay that works, that is more liquidy that might actually work. Because we can pour it out we can use pipes or you can use pipets or beakers or something to measure it out so that each sock gets the same amount. You don't wanna, again don't wanna put twice as much hot sauce for this to fight than this one, that's not fair.\u000a Yes sir. Okay, what kind of hypothesis?\u000a Our hypothesis was if we test all three samples,\u000a Test all three. and then I believe that the Clorox will remove the stain faster.\u000a So you're picking Clorox, why'd you pick that?\u000a Because the Clorox is sponsored by more,  by more varieties of stain removers and they beat...\u000a So in other words you've seen commercials about it?\u000a Yes sir.\u000a So you're taking what you know, inferences like we talked about, talking about what you know and making a prediction. This one seems familiar, have you heard of Zout?\u000a No sir.\u000a Okay most people say they haven't. I don't know why.\u000a  I picked the same one because that's the only one I'd heard of.\u000a And the reason why we said...\u000a Instead of using a marble which I forgot at home and we used weights, but they were way too heavy. So we put a glue stick on a piece of each tape that was about 10 centimeters long, and we made a cut in it that was one centimeter because one half centimeter was too steep or thick. And then we recorded it and we found that the first one that dropped was this one which was a second, it didn't hold on at all. And then this one was 17 seconds and then Scotch proving to be the strongest dropped at 79 seconds.\u000a  79 seconds alright cool. So what does that data then tell you, Sharonda? You said when you collected it, what are you, looking at what you found out with your data? What does it prove?\u000a That the Scotch tape is better.\u000a And it's not even close. So I like how you guys have chosen to use a bar graph because I can just look at it, I can just look at it and go wow look at that. The bar is up so huge compared to the other two. Okay so it's very easy to distinguish which one did the best. Okay. Did you find maybe, ladies, that you had any kind of error?\u000a  Well yeah, the first time I cut into the tape I cut too deep like twice.\u000a Cut too deep?\u000a Yea, and then we found out the weights just tore right away. They were way too heavy. They wouldn't even hold on when I let go.\u000a  So you're very careful about making it drop.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Alright, cool. Okay so what kind of data are you collecting Mark? I mean what kind of data are you guys trying to put together?\u000a We trying to figure our which one is stronger, which one would last the longest.\u000a Right now we're seeing which one lasts the longest for how many times we rinse it. This is the first time we're rinsing it and then we're trying to wipe it up again.\u000a  Okay and this is still the...\u000a This is still corn syrup.\u000a Still the corn syrup. Okay cool, alright that'll work. So how are you gonna organize this?\u000a I'll chart a graph, and we're gonna see how, which one tears first on which rinse.\u000a  So you're just going straight up by the numbers, before it rips. Kind of simple so that gives you, that generates you some numbers to use, okay. Alright. Michael, did you guys, I know you're still kind of in the middle of collecting your data. Anything you see that can be done better, something maybe you made an error with? Something that seems to not be working like you expected?\u000a Dropping this one.\u000a  Okay.\u000a That was one.\u000a  That was one alright, anything else? Maybe that you're noticing with your, anything that you're noticing with your procedure that you could, to make it?\u000a This guy could help out a little bit more.\u000a We could've put this stuff in a little beaker thing, would've made it easier.\u000a  Put what in the beaker?\u000a Our solutions and stuff so we could've put it in there. That way we have an exact measurement.\u000a  That's true, okay so what, what you're saying is that your experiment may have some errors because you don't really know what's left?\u000a We got measurments but we don't have exact measurements.\u000a  So you think it would've been better to do that, if you were to do it again that's what you might do? Okay, alright cool. Carry on.  Okay, hi Jeff and Keosha. Alright so you're right in the middle of collecting your data. Do you have a, have you come up with a data table yet? Designed how you want it to look? Not yet, how do you think you want to? You gotta make it organized when you put your data in. How you gonna write it down? Any ideas?\u000a What about a graph?\u000a Well, you're definitely gonna have a graph too. But you also need a data table to record it, now that you're starting to get some results.\u000a I don't know to do that, like.\u000a  Okay well we'll just think about it then, make something up. What do you think will be the easiest way to organize? Okay let's do this, what results are you looking for?\u000a The best thing, stain cleaner.\u000a  Okay, based on what, I mean what are you using as your rule to say that they clean the best? Color change or?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay.\u000a How much it took off.\u000a How much it took off, how are you gonna measure how much it took off?\u000a By, by the color.\u000a  Or do we need to use something?\u000a  I don't know, this is up to you guys. This is your experiment. What do you mean by the color?\u000a Like, how dark it went to light. From darkest to lightest.\u000a  Okay you do that, I mean you could compare it side by side. That's a good way, like a scale, sure. You got any other ideas? You could do that. Alright so let's just say you went straight up, we're gonna compare the original color to the new color. How can you organize that into a data table? What kind of information would you need to put in there?\u000a The color.\u000a Yeah, the color change. Okay, so the color changed. You definitely have to have the brands, you've gotta know which one did what. So how are you gonna write down the color change? How could you organize that into a chart?\u000a  That's hard.\u000a  I know, I know. I think you already told me the answer. What would you say you were looking for, what did you say you were looking for? The color change? How were you gonna compare it?\u000a  From darkest to lightest.\u000a  From darkest to lightest okay. So isn't this sorta like before, and after. So maybe you can have a, somewhere in your data table a column or a row where you're talking about what the color is before, describing it. So it's gonna be what kind of data since you're describing it?\u000a What kind of graph should we use?\u000a We'll get to that in a second. So what kind of data is that where you're just writing down like descriptions and colors? That's what we've been working on. We're not using numbers.  Well, we'll get to the graph in a second. You know what kind of data it was where we, collect descriptions and colors and words?  It's right there. Say it.\u000a It's . You've got a .\u000a Quantitative?\u000a Well that's numbers,\u000a Qualitative.\u000a Qualitative, so that's what you're doing. Now how you gonna put that in a graph? \u000a  From the darker shade to the lighter shade, right?\u000a  Decide what goes where.\u000a Okay that sounds good to me.\u000a  What kind of graph?\u000a  I don't know. If you're trying to compare and contrast these...\u000a Double bar graph?\u000a Sure. That would probably work. Okay here so, you guys have been working on which paper towel absorbs the most liquid. I see y'all have a data table that, nice and simple. Record how much water they...\u000a  Absorb.\u000a Absorb, how much water they absorb. And what kind of conclusion, Ms. Goodwin could you draw for your data?\u000a For my data I drew that Southern Homes had absorbed the most water. And then Brawny absorbed the next,  absorbed the next most. And then it was, Bounty was the last.\u000a Bounty came in last, but only barely.\u000a  Only by one.\u000a So, Josh.\u000a  Yes?\u000a Based on the results that your group got, how would you, how would that change your thinking? In other words, how might that change your shopping habits, if you had these to choose from? Well, I would pick Southern Homes more than any of the other brands because it absorbs more.\u000a  And isn't that what it's supposed to do?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. So Darren, looking back at y'all's procedure looking back at your entire lab, is there anything that maybe if your were to redo this lab right, is there something you might would change about it to make it better or more accurate?\u000a Yes I would use different measurements of water, like three of them.\u000a  Three?\u000a Yes.\u000a You mean like repeated? Like maybe for each paper towel do it three times?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay, alright, that's actually a pretty good idea because when you do those extra trials it helps to eliminate mistakes. Because you could've found out with these two being so close, if you would've had time to be able to do it two more times you could have found that maybe on average Bounty ended up beating Brawny, or vice versa you never know. Okay, Mia. What about, what about your hypothesis, was it right? Did you pick the correct one?\u000a No, I picked Brawny.\u000a Brawny, okay so what kind of new hypothesis, based on this? Let's say that you guys came up with a whole new idea, that was different from what you did this test. Like another whole procedure like Darren was saying, do it multiple times, maybe it's completely different. What kind of new hypothesis would you make, if you were gonna do a similar experiment with a twist to it?\u000a I would pick Southern Home.\u000a Just because it won this one?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, so based on your results you might choose the same one. Anybody think they would choose a different one?\u000a  I'd still stay with the same one.\u000a Which was which one?\u000a Brawny.\u000a Why would you still pick Brawny?\u000a Because it was close it wasn't, it was like, it wasn't that close, but if we would've made like more, if we had tested it more then it would've probably stayed.\u000a And so do you think it's possible,\u000a It is possible.\u000a that if you did a completely different test, than just seeing which one sucked up water, maybe if you tested strength, Brawny could have won that one?\u000a Yes. I know it could.\u000a  Okay, cool. I like how y'all did the lab it was nice and simple. And other then Darren's error did you see anything that, anything else you would do differently? Anything else that you feel that you could have done better other than just maybe doing it extra times?\u000a  Test to see like how thick it is.\u000a  Test the thickness of the paper towel?\u000a Yes. \u000a  Are you straight? So in other words have a second type of test. Okay, sure.\u000a I'll probably change the temperature of the water.\u000a  Change the temperature of it?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Oh, that's true. So you have to add in different variables because maybe one of them works better under\u000a Heat.\u000a  or lasts better under higher heat, okay. Cool, awesome.\u000a  Tim!\u000a It's okay Tim doesn't have to be over here. So let's see what kind of chart you have. Now explain this chart to me Deontay, because all I'm seeing is check marks.\u000a I did mine, I just did something simple.\u000a  Okay that's fine.\u000a I put my name right there and I put if it left a light stain I left a check mark and if it left a dark stain, I meant stain, I put a check mark.\u000a  Okay, so I see some of y'all are still working on your graphs and how you wanna display them.  Alright. So why did you choose a bar graph?\u000a So we can do like the levels of the stains, we got like medium.\u000a  Medium.\u000a Light and dark.\u000a Let me see. So you saying you're doing, you're going kind of like a qualitative data, light, medium, dark and you're just sort of shading up to the level you think that it had. Okay, how could you do that better? What might be a more reliable way to gather data? I mean the color change is okay, I mean the color change is fine because that's what you're looking for, right? When you buy a stain remover you wanna see that it takes the stain out. What might be some more reliable data you could gather, if you were to do this differently, for the future? You need to come up with a creative way to get better data or more data maybe?\u000a The more data we can get is by looking through the sock up under the sock to see how dark the color went through.\u000a Okay, so compare the levels and how much stain was pushed through the sock?\u000a Yes sir.\u000a Alright that'll work. What else?\u000a Or we can tell by if it's a light, if it's a ring around a light spot then we can tell if it cleared and if it clears some color off of it.\u000a So you're talking about maybe the shape of the stain or...\u000a Yes sir, the shape of the stain.\u000a Okay, possibly.\u000a And if it's a ring around it like this one right here, if it's a ring around it it's a light spot and we can tell it isn't't clean enough.\u000a  Alright, so how about this? Whose opinions did you use to get these scales?\u000a  I used my own for mine.\u000a  Okay. Cause they think that one was the best and I think this one was the best.\u000a  So, what might be, think about this what might be a better way, a more reliable way to get more data, than just your opinions?\u000a  Ask other people's opinions.\u000a  Ask other people. Again, if you were to redo it, do you think it would be a better idea to maybe ask some other people?\u000a  Yes, Like going around the class asking what they think?\u000a  Getting a vote.\u000a  Like a vote, like a survey?\u000a  Yeah a survey.\u000a  Or a vote, okay. Alright, last thing. Now that you've finished it, what kind of problems did you see? Is there something that okay, if I did this again, I know we could've had some error during this point, like we could've made a mistake here?\u000a We saw that, if we woulda let the colors and the stain remover sit a little longer, that it wouldn't have come out.\u000a

V  We started testing out our theory that it's an exponential.\u000a 'Cause we found out that the ratios...\u000a  Does that verify that it's an exponential equation?\u000a We thought it did but it doesn't.\u000a  So why aren't you sure?\u000a I don't know.\u000a  So the more disks I add, I'm eventually gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves that I can make.\u000a Isn't that a logistic function?\u000a  So logistic function would say that you're gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves you make. And it would say at some point you're gonna slow down the number of moves you're adding on. Does that make sense based on what you've done so far?\u000a No, not at all.\u000a  What do you think is gonna happen instead?\u000a That it would increase.\u000a  And what would that be?\u000a That's the exponential.\u000a But the numbers are all really long decimals.\u000a  So, I heard someone in here earlier say you were gonna scatter plot this. So have you looked at your scatter plot?\u000a  Yes\u000a  Okay. What might be other ways to change an exponential function?\u000a  I can get it out of my backpack.\u000a  Based on what you had before what was your gut instinct with your ratio? Before you did any of the arithmetic, what did you think your ratio might be?\u000a Small? I don't know. I didn't really think it was two automatically.\u000a  But two's in your head. Why is two in your head?\u000a  Because doubling?\u000a Because there's doubling.\u000a  Here's what I'm gonna suggest to you guys. You've got your scatter plot on Marissa's calculator, right? You're thinking that two might have been the ratio. Why don't you graph two y equals two to the X and compare it to what's happening on your scatter plot and see if there's a different way that you might be able to change the extremum.\u000a  It's increasing by a factor of 2. She's trying it in an actual game.\u000a  Normally I'd want you guys to struggle with it right now but it sounds ... We're at 20 so what's your goal?\u000a 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.\u000a Good job, Caitlyn.\u000a  Good job. Now I'm convinced that that works. You're seeing that the difference is doubling each time, correct? What kind of function is that suggesting?\u000a Exponential.\u000a  And what do you suspect is probably your factor?\u000a  Two?\u000a  Two? So that's what I want you to look at. How could you verify that it's an exponential function using any of the tools you have here? Once you've found out this was an exponential function what did you do to figure out what the function actually is?  There is a little bit of a trick to this one. It has to do with some of the other types of changes we do to functions. Okay? Figure out that. When you get stuck again, let me know and I'll be back.\u000a  So you think that's two to the power of X minus one?\u000a  Why did you get minus one?\u000a Because with one it worked fine but with two, when you try to put in X as the exponent, two to the X so two times two is four. So far X minus 1 is the exponent.\u000a  What I'm hearing is that you're convinced that the factor is two. And you're trying to do some transformations on this to make your y values fit with what you got here, is that correct? Talk me through again why you guys think that the exponent is x minus one and then why you're adding the one at the end? \u000a Because there has to be at least one move.\u000a  We added the one at the end because we were looking at just the y values first.\u000a Oh wait, that doesn't work though. If you have one, so two to the zero is 1. And one plus one is two but that's ...\u000a Tell me more about this idea of the plus one at the end. You said that had something to do with why you had to have a plus one.\u000a Is it a piece of the function? That would be really mean.\u000a We were like well it has to double and then we have to add one on the end.\u000a  I think you guys are in a great place. I think you've got a good idea here which is to take y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gives you this table. So try more with the transformation. I also like this idea you guys have about how you have to have at least one move, but I would think a little bit more about how to pattern your moves, that's just that you need at least one move. Alright, I'm going to leave you guys to think. I'll come back.\u000a  So we found the equation but now we're stuck at number four.\u000a  Okay, so talk to me about the equation and tell me how you found it.\u000a  The difference between...\u000a  I was kinda thinking of how this was relating to the difference, so how it would relate to the y values.\u000a We saw the two to the x, we figured "oh well, two to the four to the 16. Well how do we get to 15, minus one?"\u000a  This is going back to the algebra from last year. So you saw that you had two to the x. You noticed here that we have just two to the x and then you go back one using algebra. You also talked about how when you graphed two to the x it matched up with your scatter plot. Did it lie directly on your scatter plot?\u000a No.\u000a  So what do you mean by it matched up?\u000a It was close.\u000a It was the same curve.\u000a  So how did you know that created a transformation?\u000a  Because whether it depends on the number or which value it is. It changed the steepness of it. So we just knew it transformed it somehow. Like we had to have it. It wasn't the parent function.\u000a  So what made you guys think about doing a minus 1 after two to the x instead of saying four times two to the x or three to the x? How did you know that? Because if you'd done four times two to the x, you would have stretched it.\u000a  Because it would have moved to the left too... on the graph.\u000a  And what did that end up doing to your y-intercept? Okay, so that would be my next question for you. I agree with you guys that definitely there's a transformation. I agree with your algebra and your understanding of tables, you've done a nice job with that. So how does a transformation, what you've done is you've taken two to the x, what does the minus one do? Does that move this to the left? Move it up or down?\u000a  Well if you graph it...\u000a It moves it up.\u000a  Okay. So Jamie is saying that she thinks that changing the a value changed the slope of the function. And you're saying that you don't think the slope changes. Okay, so you change the y-intercept. And do you have a change in the y-intercept?\u000a It's still zero comma zero.\u000a  So you just had two to the x. Find out just two to the x. What's the y-intercept of the graph? What happened to your function and how did the function get transformed to achieve that?\u000a The y-intercept moved down.\u000a  And does that match what we've been talking about? You take the function and subtract the value and move down one? Alright you guys said you were stuck on number four?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay. Why are you stuck?\u000a So we figured out that you put But the minus one doesn't do anything.\u000a  Yeah, the numbers are so big that it doesn't matter. It actually does change the actual number a little teeny, tiny bit. But our calculator can't see that number. It looks like the same number on your calculator.\u000a  So we have a number of moves.\u000a  If each move is a second, then how long is it gonna take for the world to end? Alright, now you guys are also at the challenge question down here. Which is, based on the patterns you were seeing and how the pieces were moved. Why is your function which is correct match the way the patterns that were made? Okay? And I'll be back in a little bit. I'm going to give you guys about seven more minutes. You should answer question four before you try that. \u000a  So I got it kind of close. Looking at just... I did what you do to find a normal exponential equation. I plugged in y-two over y-one and then to the square root of four.\u000a  And are you getting consistent ratios between those y values of yours?\u000a No.\u000a  You guys are correct that this is exponential. But if we're not getting a consistent ratio between y values then that suggests that your original thought, which was to start with two to the x and do a transformation, is on the right track. So I really think you need to go back to y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gets you to these y values.\u000a Okay.\u000a  I'm gonna make a suggestion to you again stealing from another group. Try finding the differences between all these y values and see if you can see a pattern between the differences and the actual y values you have. Alright, what have you guys got?\u000a  Our answer was 30.\u000a Talk me through how you got that function and how you know it works.\u000a I realized that... the table matches the graph of two to the x but minus one.\u000a  So you just have that in your head. Did you graph it or did you just know those numbers in you head?\u000a We didn't graph it. We used the tables to confirm that it was y equals two to the x minus one. Went to the table and it was the same numbers.\u000a And I noticed here you've got 2 to the 64th minus one. What's that for?\u000a That's from another number. It's like a really high number. One point eight times\u000a Two to the 19th.\u000a  While you guys figure out how long it's gonna take for the world to end with that really huge number, I'd also like you to think about the answer to the challenge. You guys spent a lot of time looking at the patterns and how these pieces are moved. So I'd like you to think about why your function has two to the x. Why are you doubling those?\u000a

V How's everybody today?\u000a  Good.\u000a Good.\u000a Okay, we are gonna work our bodies real hard today, and we are gonna play a game called Wellness Uno. How many people, raise your hand if you've ever played Uno. Absolutely, put your hands down. Do you know that there are four colors in Uno? Who knows what one color is? Alexis, what is it?\u000a Blue.\u000a  What's another one?\u000a Um, red.\u000a Red. What's another one Nate?\u000a Yellow.\u000a Yellow.\u000a Green.\u000a Green, absolutely. Okay, we've got the Uno cards spread all around the circle here, first graders. And what we're gonna do is, in just a minute, you're gonna come up here, and you're gonna get an Uno card. I might pick this one right here, this one is a...\u000a  Green four.\u000a Green four. Okay I look at it and then I put it right back. If you notice the gym is set up in four different color zones. Point to where the green color zone is. Boom, you got a green cone over there, stay right there, watch Ms. Miller. The green color zone is the muscular strength and muscular endurance station. So if this is, you have choices when you come over here first graders. Choice number one, you can get a rope, and you can swing, how many times?\u000a  Four.\u000a Four. Swing four times. Which rope would be easier to swing on, Alexis?\u000a  The knot one.\u000a The knot one, 'cause you can hang on to it better, that's right. So you can swing, or can come over here, and you can do those bicep curls that we've been working on in muscular strength and endurance. Stand right here to the wall, and do that four times, nice and what?\u000a  Slow.\u000a Slow, absolutely. And here's your last choice at the muscular strength and endurance station, if I got, what was my number again?\u000a  Four.\u000a Four. Look there's four hula hoops on the rock wall. You would start here and you would go through hula hoop one, then hula hoop--\u000a  Two, three, four.\u000a What happens if I had a green two, how many hula hoops would I go through, Paige? How many would I go through?\u000a Two.\u000a Just two. Okay, so it's either four, whatever number that is, that's the number of hula hoops you go through. Then I come back over here and I pick another card. Hmm, did I pick this one, oh I just picked that one. Let's pick this one, what color's that?\u000a  Yellow three.\u000a Yellow three Point to the yellow color zone. Absolutely, the yellow color zone is the cardiorespiratory zone, and guess what you have to do here, first grade? There is a cone here and it says yellow--\u000a  Add zero.\u000a What was my number?\u000a  Three.\u000a Three, and if I add a zero to that, what does that make that number?\u000a  Thirty.\u000a Thirty. That's what we're gonna have to do. I have my choice, I have to do thirty of something over here. Here are my choices, I'm gonna do thirty, oh gonna work my heart, thirty step-boxes. Or if I don't wanna do that, I can do the ball on the stick. How many times?\u000a  Thirty.\u000a Thirty. And if I'm really good, and if I really wanna try, I can get a jump rope right there on the wall, and I can try jump roping thirty times. Now I'm gonna run back here and I'm gonna get another card, and I'm gonna get this one right here. This one is a--\u000a  Red six.\u000a Uh oh.\u000a  Red nine.\u000a Red nine, it's a red nine, see where that line is under there, so that means it's a nine. Red nine, point to the red color zone. Woo you guys are so smart. I come over here to the red color zone, and look, what does the red color zone have on it?\u000a  Times two.\u000a  Times two, so what was my number?\u000a  Nine.\u000a Nine. What's nine times two? Say it Alexis.\u000a Eleven?\u000a Not eleven, this is hard. What's nine plus nine? What is it Nathan? Do you know? What is it Ethan?\u000a 18.\u000a It's 18. So we're gonna do 18, Ms. Miller will help you with the math if you don't know, so we're gonna times that one by two, and here are my choices, I'm gonna come over here, and I'm gonna get a paddle, and I'm gonna, this is a hand-eye, I'm gonna use my hands and my eyes, I'm gonna put my safety strap on, and I'm gonna do how many of these?\u000a  6, 9, 18.\u000a 18 that's right, 18. And first grade, how can I challenge myself at this station? If I wanted to make this station harder for myself, how would I do that, Courtney?\u000a Um, use your left hand?\u000a Use your other hand. Ms. Miller is left-handed so if I use my left hand, I would use my right hand. So if you want to challenge yourself, you'd use your other hand, so you're gonna do that how many times?\u000a  18.\u000a 18, okay. So that's, you could either do that at this station, or I love these, these are the, I call them the ice cream cones. Look, you throw that ball and you're gonna catch that ball. Do it again, that's how many?\u000a  Two.\u000a Two. And you're gonna do that all the way 'til you get to whatever number you have at that station. That was using your hands and your eyes, watching that ball right into that cup. And now I'm gonna come over here and I'm gonna get one more, and oh, I just grabbed that one, let's see what's, oh, what's this number?\u000a  Blue...\u000a Blue six. Where's the blue color zone, point, where's the blue color zone, over there. Hey, the blue color zone is balancing, watch Ms. Miller over here. You're gonna come over here, and if you don't wanna touch the gym floor, Ethan sit down for me, you're gonna step on the stepping stones, and you can either step on the sides of the ladder, or if you wanna make it harder for yourself, you can step on these rungs, and balance all the way to the bleachers, step up, come across, and then we're gonna go on this balance beam. Hey first graders, when we're balancing, do we go fast or slow?\u000a  Slow.\u000a Slow, we go slow, we don't wanna go fast at this station, because we wanna have good balance, and we don't wanna fall. We wanna make sure we don't touch the gym floor. So that's, wait, what was my number again I forgot!\u000a  Nine.\u000a It was a nine red, how many times would I go then?\u000a  Nine.\u000a Nine times around there. Or your choice is the hippity hops, Now Ms. Miller's a little big for this hippity hop, but you kinda get the idea, you just use the boing, hop hop to the black line it's one, and then back is how many?\u000a  Two.\u000a So I would do that nine times. Okay, those are your choices, so there's four stations, yellow, red, excuse me, green, and blue. Turn around and face Ms. Miller now. I wanna talk to you about something really quick, it's something called personal integrity. You ready back there Ethan? Everybody sit on your bottoms, sit on your bottoms. Personal integrity, and first does anybody know what personal integrity is, do you think you know? Maddie, when you hear that, what do you think that means?\u000a Listening\u000a Listening, okay, what do you think Maria?\u000a If you wanna go to one station that you really like and you get a different card, you can't put it back and get the one you want.\u000a Ah! Wow, do I like that definition. Absolutely, personal integrity, this is the way I think of it, is doing the right thing when nobody else is watching. You said it Maria, you know what my favorite, I really like those swing ropes over there, I really like to do that. Would I have personal integrity, if I came over here and I did this, I got a card and it's like, ooh blue, I don't wanna go to blue, I wanna put that back. Ooh there's another blue, I don't want that. Would I have personal integrity if I kept picking cards until I got what I wanted?\u000a  No.\u000a Can Ms. Miller watch every person get a card?\u000a  No.\u000a No, so you have to have some personal integrity. Whatever card you get, that's the one, what happens if I just got a blue card, and I come over here and I pick another blue one? What am I gonna do, what am I gonna do, Paige?\u000a You put it back down and you get another one but not the same one.\u000a No, no no, we're not gonna get another one, we're going to what, it's okay.\u000a You just go back to the blue station.\u000a That's right, you're just gonna go back to the blue station, and just maybe if you did the hippity hops, maybe do the balance drill next time. Outstanding, okay, we're gonna get started, this is what I want you to do. Oh I forgot one more rule, when you get a card, do you ever run across the Indian?\u000a  No.\u000a Do we ever run across her because we wanna stay spread out, we don't wanna bump into anybody. Nelson, do you have a question? Do you have a question about something?\u000a You'd probably rip the card.\u000a You would absolutely rip the card if you were to step on them or actually you might slide on them and you could hurt yourself. Hands down, let's get started. I'm gonna call months of the year. And if I call your month of the year that your birthday is in, then you're gonna get up, and you're gonna go get a card. Are you ready? If you have a birthday in January, February, or March, go get a card. How 'bout April, May, and June. July, August, September. October, November, and December, let's go.  What'd you get Chris, let's see man. What is that, talk to me.\u000a Red eight.\u000a Red eight, do you know what eight plus eight is? Eight plus eight, think about that. Almost, 16, go do 16 of those, good job buddy. Hey Paige, you wait on the end of the mat there until Alexis is done. What's your number Alexis? Four, don't hold the bottom, grab up at the top like Brian is doing, that's perfect, yeah. What was your number?\u000a  One\u000a  What was it?\u000a  One.\u000a One, did you do one? Do you think you can do one then come back here and go get another card. Ooh Steven, Steven what'd you get, man? What is it?\u000a Blue seven.\u000a It's a blue seven, go! Hey Ethan, what'd you get? Now remember the line means what?\u000a A yellow six.\u000a Okay, what are you gonna do with that yellow six? Wait come here, look at me,  you're gonna put a?  No, you're gonna add a what to the end of that? A zero, and that makes it what number?\u000a 60.\u000a Yeah, let's go. Woo, look at these people over here at the cardiorespiratory station, they are going up-up-down-down, they are getting their heart rates up. What number did you have Maddie?\u000a Um, 50.\u000a 50, holy moly. Keep counting. It goes like this Maddie, up, up, down, down, that's one. Every time you hit the ground that's one, okay? Woo! Be careful. That's okay, just hold it up like this. Watch, watch, you see how it whirls like this at the bottom? There you go like that, it can get pretty hard. Yeah, Chris?\u000a  I saw one card that was um, um it was turned over.\u000a  Oh did you?\u000a  So I flipped it over.\u000a Oh really, thank you so much, I appreciate you taking care of the cards for me. Here you go, five times two, what's five plus five?\u000a Ten.\u000a Ten, that's what it is. Jamie, what'd you get?\u000a Forty\u000a Forty? Did you get four yellow? Go. Woo look at these hippity hops over here Outstanding. Man are you guys doing a good job, I like how you're going really slow at this station, that's good balancing. Ooh Chris, way to get your balance back. Slow down buddy, woah Nelson, I know. Can you put one foot in front of the other? Can you bring your other foot in front? Wanna try it? Ms. Miller's right here in case you have to grab onto me. Yeah, look at that, what a good balancer you are.\u000a I balance on the monkey bars.\u000a You balance on the monkey bars?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Woo! Good job. You did it, good job. All right what'd you get buddy? Blue four! Hey, are you supposed to have your card with you? I'll go put it back for you, remember to leave the card. Hey Jane, did you run through the middle of the Indian? Did you forget? Don't do it again, go on, stay on the floor. Way to practice! How's it going over here Paige and Ethan? Keep your eye right on that ball. Ooh Paige that was close. Right on there, good job. How bout you come over here. What is eight times two? What's eight times two Paige, do you know that? That's a hard one.\u000a Nine.\u000a Eight plus eight. Eight plus eight kids. Six times two, what's six plus six? Six and six put the two sixes together.\u000a 12.\u000a 12! That's what it is. Just keep going, there's new music coming on, there's new music coming on first grade. Keep it going. Way to go there, Nelson, I like that. Woo! Your arms hurt? You're getting a lot of good muscular strength. What'd you get here, let's see. What is that?\u000a Yellow seven.\u000a What are you gonna do to that seven? You're gonna put a what on the end of it? A what are you gonna put on it?\u000a A zero.\u000a What does that make it?\u000a 70.\u000a Go! Woo Maddie you got a blue--\u000a Nine.\u000a Yes! No kidding! Don't go running. What is that card?\u000a A yellow four.\u000a And what are you gonna add to that four?\u000a

V So, good morning everyone.\u000a Good morning.\u000a Good morning, today, today, what we have is, we're going to have a debate based on a couple things that we have recently experienced. One was research that we have conducted about the chemistry in scientific measurement that's required in order to address a local issue that we have with current regulations on water and different lobbying groups trying to change those regulations for their own interests and the groups they represent. Okay. And so we had a field trip to Wastewater Treatment Plant that allowed us to gain information locally from scientists to see what they're doing on their side and what their opinions are for either side of this debate that is current in our city. So, today I'm going to start with our overarching question which has really helped us in our research and is now going to help us to just devise our debates. The overarching question is up on the board if you'd like to see it. It says, how is scientific measurement applied in the creation and the regulation of our local environmental protection laws? The environmental protection side over here is proposing new tighter regulations that may have an impact on local businesses and rate payers, or the people who pay for the water utilities in our city. So, I'll discuss the format of our debate. First, and that's, again, up on the board. I will be finishing up my introduction here, and then we will have our lobbyist group introduce themselves, who they represent, and what their major goals are for today's debate. Okay. Then we'll have a question session where each group will be able to probe into the reasoning and the deeper understandings to reveal your research and each side of the story, so that our City Council members on our outer rows back here will be able to reflect upon what is being said. So, city council members, please be writing your notes. When we get towards the end of our debate time period we will then have you folks make a debate. It's going to be a vote on whether or not we should agree with the environmental side and their decision to make tighter regulations to change current regulations to allow lower levels into the water of various different chemicals that they will be discussing. Okay. At the end, each side will have a one minute opportunity to discuss a focus summary statement in which they will be able to summarize the things that have been revealed during today's debate.  Good. And then, as I said, at the end we will have a vote. City Council will vote on whether  we should make the restrictions tighter on the water quality standards in our city. Are there any questions before we begin? Okay, excellent. And so, I believe the, this side had choice, and so that means that Corbin and his group, for representing industry, will be allowed to have that closing, the last closing statement today. And so we'll start with Tyler, and then we'll try to go back as fairly as possible, back and forth. So Tyler, if you'd like to start with your opening comments about who you represent and why you're here today.\u000a Our side of the argument focuses on the environmental side of the debate. We believe that new water regulations via legislation that would more effectively treat our drinking water should be enacted. The hazardous and deleterious chemicals that are in our water, particularly the excesses amounts of nitrogen and phosporous need to be controlled. While it may negatively affect the selfish interests of industry our group would like to promote the idea that doing nothing and leaving our water the way it is is not an option.\u000a  Excellent. So Corbin, we're ready to hear your side and who you represent.\u000a Our side focuses on the business aspect of this debate. We hope to persuade the EPA and City Council to agree that the waste water that we put back into creeks and streams meets the criteria that is currently the standard for cleanliness. And that it does not need improvement except for a few chemicals which does not improve nitrogen and phosphorous or that we do not need to severely increase taxes to pay for all of that.\u000a Outstanding. And so, and then we will begin, I guess, then, with Tyler who can go ahead now, and you can ask your first question. And we'll be looking for City Council members. If you have any questions that need to be clarified, statements that you would like to determine what the reasoning is behind it, please raise your hand, and we'll make sure that you get in immediately. Okay.    This is so funny.\u000a Okay, we figure that since you say that our waters don't really need to be, it already meets the standards of cleanliness, but already in Colorado we see fresh water species that are becoming more endangered, as the more chemicals, because of the pollution that is put into our waters via industries like metals and dentistry. have already become endangered and extinct, and we just would like to know why you think that that means that the water's clean enough.\u000a Okay, let me ask you this. Do you have information on what chemicals killed those fish?\u000a We have like the excess amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous that the EPA, the standards that they're trying to enforce now. Like we saw on the video, this creates the dead zones because it removes oxygen and the algae, algae blooms start to produce. So, it's mostly the nitrogen phosphate that's preventing the correct amount of oxygen in the water for the fish to breathe, technically.\u000a Okay. I'd like to follow this up with an article from, I believe this is from the Gazette, which is our Colorado Springs newspaper. Since we're focusing this debate on Colorado, most likely our city, we see that our city does not have a problem with algae blooms, says the writer of this article. So, therefore, when you talk about algae blooms, we don't have a problem with this. So why should we be focusing on it?\u000a Because the water runs off the lakes. That does cause a problem with us.\u000a Okay. But even if we did have, I mean, a few...  Like I said again, our city does not have problems with these. So we can't, therefore, we can't focus our debate on these things because it doesn't apply to us.\u000a Well, that one article in a local newspaper from one writer said that we don't have problems with algae blooms. But I've been in the mountains around our area, and I've seen many lakes, ponds, just completely covered with algae and scum. And that so many of our local creeks, Monument Valley Park, and stuff, are just littered with gross algae, and it creates these dead zones that the fish swim into and do not have any way to swim out of because they have no nutrients in them and just die on the spot.\u000a And the same thing happened in the 1960s with Lake Erie, and it later happened with Chesapeake Bay like we saw in the video. And the same thing was happening where they said we don't need to fix it everything's fine, and then just as nothing, nobody did anything. The lake soon was dead, and it was like, there's no fish in there. And the water's just completely ruined with all kinds of chemical wastes, so doing nothing isn't really...\u000a Okay, so I'm gonna interject. What I'm hearing is that there's a debate in here about whether or not our local water is an issue, so I'd like to hear from somebody in the City Council area who will be making a vote today. How about your thoughts about the current water quality? What you have heard from your constituents in the areas where you are located and to determine whether or not you feel currently, right now, what level of danger are we at? Have you heard a lot about this? Do you feel like we are in need of serious change? So, we can direct the rest of the debate. Okay. Anybody who would like to contribute? Okay, Stephan.\u000a Well, all I know is that where we're located, we're at the, we're pretty much the first people that use our water, and then it goes downstream for other people to use it, so, so when we were talking about eliminating the pollution, the pollutants that we put into the water, it's not, it wouldn't be really affecting our city, but the cities that are down the stream from us.\u000a Okay, but this article says that our, excuse me, I think I read this wrong, our state does not have a problem with algae blooms.\u000a Regardless of the algae problem, it says without the oxygen, the fish, bugs, and other organisms that live in the water will die, and quoting from the same article it says in the worst case scenario you basically have water devoid of all natural aquatic life.\u000a But that's a worst case scenario that we don't have right now and we haven't had, and it's not an issue in Colorado. Granted, it might be an issue in like Chesapeake Bay, or Lake Erie. \u000a But we don't have it here, it says so. And multiple scientists have backed that article as well.\u000a Now Corbin, do you have any measurements, or do you have some values that you can back that up with?\u000a Not specifically on nitrogen and phosphorous. I tried to find some, but I found...\u000a So, does anybody have any of that information because we want to know how close to danger are we.  Do we know about current levels or about where we want to go with this? \u000a Okay I would like to comment on... \u000a I'm sorry, behind you, I just called on her.\u000a Oh, excuse me.\u000a So, even if it's probable, wouldn't you want to prevent it from like happening here, with the algae? \u000a Well, if it's not happening already then what do you have to do to keep it from happening?  Yeah, if it happened, but it hasn't happened yet.\u000a Yeah, but what she's saying is it might happen.\u000a Yeah.\u000a I mean just saying that something might happen is just like saying something awful might. I mean I could say that, you know, an earthquake might kill everyone tomorrow. It might happen. We don't know if it's going to happen.\u000a But fish and other organisms are dying. It is happening. It's not necessarily just the algae, but it's the future problem. We've already seen issues with the...\u000a  Yeah, let's see what Nina has to say as far as City Council.\u000a Well, I just have a question, wouldn't it be better to be safe than sorry? _ You're right, it would be better to be safe than sorry, but like I said the levels of toxins in the water right now do meet the EPA required standards. So, therefore, it is a safe level according to the scientists who work for the EPA.\u000a But we're saying that the EPA standards need to be improved.\u000a  Yes, yes, we realize that.\u000a Because they're not, they're too low, and there are many chemicals that are new because of new industry in metal companies and many other things that are dumping into streams. And those chemicals are getting through.\u000a How would you go about doing this? How would you go about stopping the pollution? Because something that's important to remember here is the fact that the pollution is not only caused by industry it's something that's misconcepted, is for example cars. People think cars pollute the air, and it exactly does pollute the air. But when it goes up and it becomes acid rain and it falls back into our creeks it's also a pollutant. Therefore, industry's not the only people who are polluting the lakes. It's actually U.S. citizens doing the same work too.\u000a  Okay, I like that. And so, can you be more specific? Did anybody gain anything on the fieldtrip about learning about which types of things the citizens in our area are putting down their drains?\u000a Yes.\u000a  That may cause issues?\u000a Yes.\u000a  Okay.\u000a I've got a whole bunch of them.\u000a  Alright, Corbin, why don't you share then what it is?\u000a You want me to read all of them, or just?\u000a  So, we're not focusing just on one group. There may be other groups as well, but also maybe it could be addressed as a result of this debate. Go ahead, Corbin. \u000a Well, the guy that we had giving us the tour of the wastewater facility did make some funny comments that he's found some pretty ridiculous things in the water treatment plants. Some of those examples were railroad ties, dentures, and he found a live person inside of them one time. So, it's not like the waste treatment plant is purposely putting all this out there. It's, you can't stop humans from putting out waste, and a lot of the stuff that they're putting in there that they're actually reducing the levels to parts per a billion or parts per a trillion, which some of the machines there do do, are poisonous things like fluoride. Which actually, the highest water treatment plant that puts out the most fluoride is actually Mason, which is right up there, and lead and mercury. And it eliminates that from parts to a billion from parts to a trillion. \u000a Well, first of all, I would like to answer Mr. Dunmar's question, or Mr. Waz' question. I'm sorry...  We do have information on how much nitrogen is required in the water, and it's 10 parts per million. So, that's just to answer that question, and then to move on to yours. Yes, of course, as you said in your own words, you can't stop people from the pollution that they do cause. However, it is the job of the water treatment plants to kind of remove that pollution and to produce a safe environment. And when we don't have strict enough regulations this environment is endangered for not only for people, but for also the wildlife, for the economy, for, you know, natural systems that occur within Colorado. It's all, you're putting it all on the line.\u000a Okay, let's talk about what would happen if we did restrict pollutants that go into the water.\u000a  Okay.\u000a Well, let's talk about the costs that everybody's, the citizens are going to be paying that they said that all our state is going to be paying.\u000a Before you talk about cost, would you rather pay more and be safe or pay less and risk dying?\u000a Okay. I would like to comment on that. That's an asinine statement because do you have a statistic on how many people have died from water pollution?\u000a I do have a statement from the Secretary General of the United Nations. Ban Ki-moon says, "More people die from unsafe water than from all forms of violence including war."\u000a  You just said from the United Nations.\u000a Yeah, this isn't, yes, we're talking about a local issue now, but that is a statement that proves that.\u000a Okay, I would like to comment on this once more, when you said United Nations that's...\u000a  Okay, I'm sorry. We're going to have to go to hand raising I believe because we're getting too fast of an answer before someone gets a chance to finish. So, Theo finish up, and then Corbin will follow behind you. \u000a No, I made my point.\u000a Okay.\u000a Well, like you said, you do realize that's a local issue, but the U.N. is United Nations of the world. So, that's not a local issue. You're bringing up a fact that's from countries like Africa that don't have clean water at all, nonetheless water. So, of course they're going to die from water poisoning, but here in the United States, we have the cleanest water in the world, no matter where it is. And Colorado also has one of the cleanest state populations of water, if you will, out of all the states.\u000a Yeah, because of the regulations we have in place, and with the new chemicals that are being put into our water, we need to restrict our regulations.\u000a  What are the new chemicals?\u000a  Yeah, they've been there for awhile.\u000a We're having new problems though.\u000a  Can you explain it?\u000a Everything such as nitrogen and phosphorous.\u000a  It hasn't been an issue before. Why is it an issue now?\u000a It has been an issue.\u000a It absolutely has.\u000a It has happened all over the United States.\u000a  Okay, when we talk about nitrogen, we're talking about if we restrict that we're talking about maybe shutting down part of what we do here. As we all know that we are, we do grow many crops in our state. And nitrogen, mostly where it comes from, is fertilizers used in that industry. So, to say that we're going to restrict nitrogen would be, we might have to restrict or shut down some industries that do produce food.\u000a  Such as what? What industries?\u000a For fertilizers.\u000a Fertilizers.\u000a You can't use fertilizers on your lawn because if you have...\u000a And not even lawn, crops.\u000a Crops, lawns, anything because the fertilizer you use goes down drains, which go into creeks, which is really polluting it more than the wastewater facility was.\u000a So, shouldn't the wastewater facility pollute it less since we already have natural pollution coming from these facilities? \u000a We're already doing so much to prevent these chemicals from going into...\u000a Okay so Will, I hear you're saying that we're doing a lot. What was learned on the field trip? Specifically what role do the scientists play who are employed by our city? What role do they play at the wastewater treatment plant? And how does that affect your group's goals for today's debate? What are the scientists doing, specifically, and how does it support your side? \u000a Like they said on the fieldtrip, they use bacteria, E.coli, to break down the wastewater that's in the water. It's not like they're adding pollutions to it. Their job is to take it out, which they are trying to do. By doing that, they add some phosphorous and nitrates that are just byproducts of it, but they remove a lot of those afterwards. It's not like to clean it 100%, it's going to cost 25 billion dollars, and that's just for the state of Colorado.\u000a  Okay, let's see a City Council members. I'm trying to get to them quickly. I'm sorry, Amanda, behind you, Stephan.\u000a Where did you get that information that it would cost 25 billion dollars?\u000a  This is from the Gazettte.\u000a  The Gazette article.\u000a  It's from the article.\u000a Science has proven that to remove nitrogen and phosphorous from the water, which is you guys's goal to restrict it, it's going to cost about 25 billion dollars to remove it all. If you just want to do parts of it, it's still going to be 2.46 billion dollars.\u000a Which is four times the amount of what it is costing right now to remove the things from the water.\u000a Wouldn't that be better tough than  having to fix up a completely good stream that destroys the economy.\u000a Well I actually, on the fieldtrip, I asked several of the chemists that work there whether the pollutants that we put into Fountain Creek and what we're doing for the environment, and they said the water they put back into Fountain Creek is the water they get out of it. It's cleaner than that.\u000a Yeah.\u000a So, in my opinion, that statement is totally absurd. We're putting cleaner water for nature, and nature seems to enjoy it more as I asked the chemist as well. And farmers down stream also enjoy that water to water their crops, and it helps their crops grow more than Fountain Creek's streams already.\u000a  Excellent point, Corbin. Why don't we try Alexis and see what she has to say.\u000a I have a question as to how the water pollutants destroy the economy. You can say a lot about the economy.\u000a  What do you mean by water pollutants destroying the economy?\u000a Well you say that...\u000a

V Emotions.\u000a Is emotions, that's so right. Kippa, were you going to say something else?\u000a In this picture, he uses lots of texture to create, like when he's doing the sunflowers, he uses texture to show the light going on.\u000a Right, and how did he show that texture, did he, how did he apply his paint?\u000a Sometimes he would squirt it straight from the tube onto the canvas because he wanted to do it fast.\u000a Sometimes he would squirt straight from the tube and he would paint so thick, Vincent would, that you could almost feel it, feel the texture. And emotion, like Ozea said. Emotion was huge for Vincent. If he was happy, he painted bright. If he was sad, he painted sort of dark. How about our man Pablo Picasso? What movement, Logan, is he?\u000a Do you know the move--\u000a Cubism.\u000a  Cubism. And why, do you guys know what the characteristics are of cubism? Anybody besides Mr. Logan, anybody else know? But thanks Logan for raising-- What are you thinking, what...\u000a Using geometric shapes to make things.\u000a Using geometric shapes, that's right. He was very involved in geometric shapes and you can even see, and flattening the shapes and flattening his color. Where Van Gogh used his color to really be part of his painting and it could be bright or it could be dull or a mixture of the two. Picasso used very flat shapes of color and you can even see that in his self-portrait. I wanna put up the work. Let's start with our man Vincent again. Let's take a look at-- See where my hand... Oooh! You can see all the wrinkles in my hand.\u000a  No way!\u000a Isn't that cool? Okay! Sorry, don't mean to keep fooling around. So let's talk about this. Let's talk about these two paintings, guys. What do you guys, and let's see if someone else maybe can answer or talk about something. What do you see, do you guys see a difference between these two paintings right here? Anybody, somebody besides Kippa, Carina?\u000a That it kinda has to deal with his emotion, like where the boats are, I feel like, what I'm feeling is that he was kinda depressed and very sad because the skies were kinda dark and stuff. And then at the sunflowers he's really happy and bright and...\u000a That was good, Carina. Okay, Elijah, did you wanna? Was that about what you were gonna say? You were gonna talk about the sadness. What colors, like do you think that if... Go ahead, Elijah.\u000a He could've been in the boat because on the computer the boats were really bright colors but the sky was darkened more but the boats were all light yellow and dark, light red and all these other bright colors.\u000a Right, and I remember you saying that when you showed me with the picture from the computer, that's why I looked at you because you were talking about he must have been conflicted with his emotions, wasn't that what you were saying?\u000a Yeah, he was feeling both happy and sad 'cause the sky was darkened and then the boats were really bright and the sea was darkened too.\u000a Right, that's good. Okay, Jose, what did you wanna say?\u000a He's sort of like there too, but the boats might be out to sea. Like one's out to sea but one's not, but torn. I don't know how many are already but... Three are out, in. I don't know how many are out.\u000a There's four that are here and then there look like four that are out.\u000a I think that's the other-- \u000a Okay but what were you going to say... Oh you're right, three. Well what were you gonna say about them?\u000a I'm guessing three, two or three were the family of six kids and the mom and a dad. But they could only take three because there's only enough for... There's enough room for only three boats or three people. But they only wanted their own boat, two or three of them were, but three didn't go because they didn't know what to do or anything but the other three did.\u000a Interesting, that was sort of your story behind the picture that you saw?\u000a Kind of.\u000a Yeah, I like that, I like that. Trevor, what're you gonna say?\u000a It's kinda like medium of a position between sad and happy because the sunflowers, they're mostly up but looks like they're starting to droop. They're starting to die.\u000a  That is good, I like that.\u000a He might be like, "Oh, I'm happy for a while but "I'm starting to feel back down."\u000a  Nice. Did you wanna say something?\u000a I would like to say one has different types of  One looks more real. Those ships on the top look a little bit more real than the...\u000a Than the bottom, more realistic than this picture? He really pushed his color lips in the sunflowers, I think. Does anybody know, what were you gonna say, Elijah?\u000a You can see in the sunflower one like at the very top there's bright yellow but when you go down a little bit it's orange and then at the very bottom it's dark green. Like right there.\u000a Yes that is very true. That is very good.\u000a The storms and the sunflowers is trying to say that nothing is never everlasting.\u000a  Wow, Kyle...  Happiness is never lasting and what was the last one? I'm moved by that opinion. Go ahead, and what was the...?\u000a So in the flowers, the flowers are happy but then they start to droop and die.\u000a Because happiness can be fleeting. And we know-- Oh, does anybody know, what was the political, was there any political things going on? The political mood or the setting. Where was Vincent from, did you guys find that in your research? He stayed in France, is that where he studied? Is that what you guys are telling me?\u000a  Yeah\u000a That was sorta the hub of his movement, we'll say. Any other facts that you guys know about the artwork that's up? You can look on your research papers to see. Or anything-- Go ahead, Emily.\u000a I think that the actual emotions of these paintings don't really connect at all with the political mood because when he painted the bright sunflower one so awesome it was kind of a dark time in France. So really I don't think they were much of a...\u000a Really affected him? What were you...\u000a Going along with Emily, maybe he was just so dull that, or maybe it was coming to an end when he painted them. Because if there was a war or some sort of bad time and it was coming to an end he was probably starting to feel better about it because it was ending. So it depends, maybe he was going through things like maybe a very happy thing happened in his life then. Because he didn't have the happiest of all lives so...\u000a He didn't. We've even talked about that. Do you guys remember when we talked about how Vincent Van Gogh suffered a little bit mentally? He was a little...\u000a Crazy.\u000a Crazy and in and out of mental institutions.\u000a Yeah so maybe something good happened. 'Cause his life was not very happy. So most of his pictures are... No, not most of them but quite a few of them are actually quite dull. But you can tell when he's going through joy because he has those bright colors coming in. Like the boats, you can see a little bit of happiness in them but the majority of it is dark and sort of sad. And then if you look at the sunflowers they're all bright and dreamy. I mean yes, this is a few dark bits but I think that's probably a time when he was going through something that was better in his life.\u000a Guys, this is really great. I love all your comments. Logan, I'm gonna take one more and then I'm gonna tell you something. What, go ahead Logan.\u000a I thought maybe that he was painting it and then something happened. Like maybe he heard that war was breaking out or something. And then he started painting it sad.\u000a I have a question.\u000a  I think that-- You've got something really important, hon?\u000a Yeah, so he never really stopped a painting in the middle. When he started he finished. He never stopped. Because if the light changed it would totally change the picture.\u000a  That's so true. That is very true. And you guys know that-- Jose, is it okay if I speak real quick and then we'll go back because we wanna talk about Picasso too for a minute. You guys know that Vincent used to live with a painter. This is my fun fact. Not really fun I guess. But a fact about Vincent. He lived with a painter, Paul Gauguin. This was when he was in and out of mental institutions. And they had a fight and he became so upset, you guys know he cut off his ear. And I showed you that one picture of him is a self-portrait of him with his ear cut off. You guys remember that? And the other important thing I wanted to tell you was that he didn't sell any of his works during his lifetime but he did sell one of his paintings after... After he died they sold one of his paintings for $8,000,000,000. Remember that? It was the most expensive painting ever sold at the time. Okay, now let's talk about... And Van Gogh people, if you guys wanna talk about Picasso you can, but let's give the Picasso teams some time here. This is... And I'm sorry the lighting is not the best. But who knows what the name of this painting is? Marie.\u000a  Is it Three Musicians?\u000a Three Musicians. And it was done by who?\u000a  Pablo\u000a Pablo Picasso. Does anybody know where Pablo Picasso was from? Let's see someone other than Mr. Logan. Travis.\u000a  Barcelona.\u000a  Barcelona. Where's Barcelona, you guys?\u000a Spain.\u000a  Spain.\u000a  I got my Barcelona jersey.\u000a Alright and who knows, Rudy, do you happen to know... And he's like, "Uh-oh, I'm on the spot! Ooo!" Do you happen to know what movement or style he painted in, Pablo Picasso?\u000a In Cubism?\u000a Cubism, that's correct. And we did go over, what were the characteristics of cubism real fast? Anybody? Mr Logan.\u000a  Geometric shapes.\u000a  Geometric shapes and what else?\u000a They were flat.\u000a  What was flat?\u000a His pictures.\u000a  But what element--\u000a His painting the colors.\u000a  The colors were flat. Thank you. Okay, let's have some opinion about what you see up here. The Three Musicians, does anybody have... Randy, do you have any, how do you feel about it, honey? What do you think about it?\u000a I don't know. It doesn't seem like it's in a down mood 'cause music is usually a happy sort of thing. So it seems like a happy kinda picture.\u000a  Kind of a happy fun picture. Pablo, he wasn't so concerned about emotions when he painted. He maybe was influenced by the political setting of his time. Does anybody know what was happening in Spain at the time? What are you thinking?\u000a  Civil war.\u000a There was a civil war. So maybe he was a little bit affected by that. He also traveled. Does anybody know where he traveled to, Rudy? To go and study the art forms of...\u000a Paris? He went to Paris because it was of all the artwork and stuff.\u000a So he went to study there and then where else?\u000a  He went to Africa.\u000a  He went to Africa and he really became obsessed with African masks. And so he did start using that as an influence in his painting. Carina, what were you gonna say, darling?\u000a Oh, I was thinking it's kind of like a mix of emotions 'cause it has so many colors. There's bright orange and yellow and then if you look deeper, there's a blue and a black and it kind of just grabs your attention.\u000a  It's attention-grabbing, isn't it? 'Cause of all the contrasting. I think more in his is the contrasting colors. You can see the blue and orange right next to each other. Those are colors that lie opposite each other on the color wheel and they make for very bright, they totally stand off each other. Right, the blue and the orange. I can't remember what-- Oh, they're complementary colors. I couldn't remember what that was. Right, so that's why. And I think his color contrast says a lot. His flat colors and they're bright and he puts them right next to each other. What do you think about this picture, Robert? Do you like it?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Do you know why you might like it or you don't like it?\u000a I like the picture, like... yeah.\u000a  Well you and Maria are talking about doing, remember you were talking about making your own picture? You wanna tell us about that, what you guys wanna do? For your own picture? And you're doing the style of Pablo, aren't you?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  So what do you think you guys are gonna do?\u000a Have a picture of me and my brother and a picture of the Three Musicians on a porch.\u000a  You wanna have the Three Musicians be in a picture with you and your brother? And Maria, are you gonna--\u000a Not on a porch. On a deck.\u000a That's what I was gonna say.\u000a  And you guys are gonna, are you guys gonna reduce it down to geometric shapes? The picture?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Try to.\u000a  Good, good. Do you guys have anybody-- Oh, what were you gonna say, Elijah?\u000a It makes me think about it, because there's so many twists and turns and curves and things. Kinda like if you look hard enough you can see 'em but when you just look at it you're like, "Whoa."\u000a Right, when you first look at it, you're like, "Whoa, what is that? Are those people? Are those shapes? "There's lots of curves and turns."\u000a  At first it's a little confusing.\u000a At first it is a little confusing, isn't it?\u000a  When you actually pick a name and you actually try to look for 'em you can actually see what it is.\u000a Right, if we didn't tell you it was the Three Musicians you might not know at first.\u000a You can kinda tell because of that one right there. That thing, yeah.\u000a The instrument here. And the guitar.\u000a And then the paper with the two...\u000a The sheet music.\u000a The sheet music, you could kinda tell it was about the musicians.\u000a What were you gonna say?\u000a When you first look at the painting, your eyes are immediately drawn to the first guy in blue's clarinet. Whereas if you peeked a minute and look at it you can actually kinda see instruments like they were saying. At first, when you just... but instead you just see a whole bunch of colors and then you look at it and it kinda starts to form.\u000a It does start to form. What were you gonna say, Emily?\u000a I think that in my\u000a

V So, here's the first set. I thought I'd start a little bit easy. So, go ahead and within your groups now, I'll give you like a minute to tell me all the methods that you can of how to separate, how to figure out which one it is. Okay? Go ahead.\u000a  You can uh...\u000a  You can you use Beer's Law for this, right?\u000a  You aren't able to taste that.\u000a You aren't able to, that's not big enough.\u000a Our...\u000a Okay, so...\u000a  Doesn't dissociate.\u000a  How's the temperature? Boil it.\u000a Yeah, that's the only way.\u000a So, the one with the highest concentration's going to have the highest boiling point.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  You could freeze it and weigh it.\u000a  Okay, freezing it.\u000a The point three would have the most weight.\u000a Weight. Yeah. But which one would freeze first?\u000a  Point one.\u000a Point one would freeze first because there's less. Okay. What else?\u000a Point three weighs more.\u000a But we would need to freeze it first, no?\u000a  What? We wouldn't need to freeze it.\u000a  The first one being, would   be with the tasting one.\u000a Or the volume one. I don't know the tasting one.\u000a Okay, you say the tasting one, you say the volume one. Whichever one comes first. \u000a  The one who boils fastest would be the one with the point one, right? Okay.\u000a So, the one that boils the fastest.\u000a  Point one.\u000a You could measure the vapor pressure by also just leaving them and adding them and then just coming back after like five minutes or ten minutes.\u000a Alright. So, we can have equal volumes of each solution, right? And then, after like a certain time--\u000a  Alright, that's it. Everybody stop. Stop, stop, stop. Okay. So, who want to go first? We'll start with with Miles, I think you had your hand up first, so go ahead. What's one way that you can identify these things?\u000a  Well, you could boil all the solutions until all the water vaporizes, and the beaker with the most sugar in it would be the 0.3 molar, 0.2 would be the middle, and 0.1 would be the least.\u000a Okay.\u000a  If they were all the same volume.\u000a  Ahh...\u000a  Yeah. You guys heard that, now? Good. Good listening skills on that. If they were the same volume at the beginning, alright? Does everybody agree? So, one method is boil away and weigh. Did you say weigh? How do you know which one has the most? I would imagine you could weigh it, right?\u000a  You could weight it.\u000a Start with equal volumes. Okay. There's several other ways. How about Joseph?\u000a If you take equal volumes of each solution and you taste them, whichever one tastes more sugary would have the highest concentration. \u000a Okay. Anybody have comments on that? Jimmy?\u000a I don't think we're able to distinguish the taste that well. Because our mouth isn't that sensitive.\u000a  Okay. Miles?\u000a What if someone dropped some lead nitrate in there? \u000a So, there's two concerns. Obviously I think Miles is the most important. You know you guys can see that I'm smart enough to put the right substances.  I keep forgetting I'm getting old. And I may go in the back, and I reach for the lead nitrate or something, right?  And then the other part, what do you guys think of the other part? Could you taste the difference between a 0.2, 0.3, and a 0.1? And just say "Ah, that's the sweetest one."\u000a  It's kind of hard.\u000a {Miles] You'd need some salt.\u000a The problem I think is this is something we would actually need to try, right? I don't think this is a theoretical thing that we're trying to, we're practicing theory here. We would actually have to do this in a lab, right? I would imagine we would.\u000a Wouldn't it be different for every person? Because we could--\u000a  It could be different for every person, right? Because I can't see as well as you, for example maybe, right? So, there could be variations in tasting of those. Ian?\u000a Given excess humans... \u000a  Oh, wait. You're on the next one?\u000a  No, on this one.\u000a Alright. I didn't get that either.  Okay, so let's look at another method, alright? We're not going to list that one because we don't want to be tasting things. Okay so Paran, your group.\u000a What about at equal volumes you could test the vapor pressure and the 0.1 would have the most, and 0.3 would have the least because there's more sugar covering it?\u000a  What do you guys think? Okay, Juan?\u000a He didn't say how you could measure it. The way you could measure it is that with equal volumes you leave them out, and the one that evaporates the fastest is the one with the highest vapor pressure. \u000a Everybody agree?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay. So, that was my concern too, right? How do you measure the vapor pressure? You're not wrong. But how do measure it? And thank you, Juan, for bringing that up.\u000a  Could you repeat that?\u000a Okay, so you would take equal volumes and leave them out to evaporate because they'd always be evaporating? The one with the highest vapor pressure which is 0.1 molar, would evaporate the most after a certain amount of time. \u000a So, I'm going to write this as evaporation rate. Who's got another method? Different view? Alright, Jimmy?\u000a Okay, so you're gonna put the same amount in a sealed container and put it into light. Whichever one grows algae first is the 0.3. Then the second one is 0.2, the last one 0.1.\u000a What do you guys think?\u000a  Could you repeat that?\u000a So, you're going to take equal amounts, take it into the light, make sure it's the same conditions for each one, and then whichever one grows algae first is the 0.3. Second is 0.2, last is 0.1.\u000a  What do you guys think? I know some of you guys are thinking that's bio, but you took it, most of you at least right? So, we could finish this. What do you think?\u000a Wouldn't it take a long time for the algae to start growing?\u000a  It's going to work, right?\u000a  Nobody sees--\u000a  Where's the algae--\u000a  You're always asking me. Come one, folks. You think about this. I'm going to say the problems. But I want you to tell me first, alright? \u000a  Alright, let's go with Ivan.\u000a I don't think the results would be consistent. Because what if some algae cells just go in one solution and start going there for no reason.\u000a So, because you didn't mention how much algae you put in, there could be an issue there. What else, though? No Juan, you go alright?\u000a I don't think you can assume that you have all the necessary stuff in the water for the algae to grow in the first place.\u000a So, I think Juan is saying growing conditions require lots of other things. Not just amount of sugar and amount of water. There could be other nutrients, is that what you're saying?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Nutrients and other things of that sort. Could I just back up for a sec? Algae produces sugar, right? Assuming that you're talking about algae that grows, they use carbon dioxide. So my hunch is, there's several, right? One, I think as Ivan pointed out, you've got to put in a certain amount. Why don't you put in something that eats the sugar like yeast, and then we could all finish and have a beer at the end?  You picked algae so, yeah. Although is that a bad idea? It could work, but we have to be careful with conditions. A lot of conditions need to be met. Anything else?\u000a  You boil them.\u000a  Hold on. Let these guys go.\u000a If you have equal volumes and you add heat to them, 0.1 should boil first.\u000a Okay, so you could use boiling point. Elevation. I wrote this down before we even discussed it. But everybody agrees that works, right? So, what's another easy one that we, boiling point elevation, right? You need me to repeat that or you got it?  What immediately follows with that idea?\u000a  Freezing point depression.\u000a Freezing point depression. Okay, what else? I have a question for you then. Could we use Beer's Law for this? No? Tell me why. Could we use Beer's Law for this? Ian, you have your hand up.\u000a At first glace I would say no because I do not believe that stuff actually has a coloring solution.\u000a  What do you guys think?\u000a  Yep.\u000a  Don't you need color? Unless what? Unless? Come on, keep going with this stuff. Not you Ian. You spoke. I'd like to have as many people participate as possible. Alright Nick, go ahead.\u000a You could add food coloring possibly. Yeah, you could add food coloring and maybe the higher concentration would appear darker, possibly?\u000a Nick, we're trying to figure out the difference between these, right?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a What do you mean "add?" You mean add a drop to each of these?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a But then what would you be measuring? The food coloring. You wouldn't be measuring the sugar. You know what I mean?\u000a  Yeah, I know what you mean.\u000a You're still okay with that?\u000a Uh, I don't know.\u000a Wait, Nick. If you add food coloring, how much? One drop?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay. One drop to each of these, right? Now they all look the same.  Don't they?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a And if I stick this in my spectral photometer, they should all measure the same. Did I succeed in figuring out which one is which? You understand that, right?\u000a  Yeah, yeah.\u000a  Okay. Nat?\u000a Could you somehow measure how fast the food coloring spreads?\u000a That's interesting. Could you measure how fast the food coloring spreads?\u000a You'd have to indicate that high concentration would--\u000a [Teacher} Hang on. But once again we have to be careful of conditions, right?\u000a  All the temperatures have to be the same.\u000a What do you guys think?\u000a  Sure.\u000a Why would that work?\u000a Because the sugar molecules are getting wet and it's not able to spread through the molecules. So, that would be in the 0.3.\u000a  Science!\u000a Glad you like it. Alright. How about, wait. Gevorg hasn't spoken. So I'm thinking, Gevorg, it's your turn buddy. What did you want to add? You wanted to add a new technique? Okay, go ahead.\u000a If we did a Benedict's Test, I don't know if it would just turn the same color because I'm not sure how the Benedict's reacts with different concentrations. But maybe if you put the same amount of Benedict's and if it gets darker or it gets affected with the molarity then you could use a color emitter or a spectrometer to test.\u000a  What do you guys think? Benedict's is a reaction between this Benedict's stuff with sugar, to show the presence of sugar.\u000a  What comes out of the reaction?\u000a  I'm not sure but it's a color change.\u000a  Oh well, the more color change--\u000a  But if the color change is too intense, it could just be like it's all going to change that color or not, see what I'm saying? That's what your pointing out, right? So again, that sounds like an experimental one. Could I share one more? How about this. You know when you take your AP test, you just don't know what. And we started with something that I think is sort of easy. Could you use density? What do you guys think? Someone who hasn't talked yet. Could we use density?  And how do we use density? What do you guys think? No? Alright, Ian. Since nobody's going for it.\u000a Do I have to say it?\u000a  Go ahead and say it. Tell me how. Tell us how.\u000a Take equal volume of each of the three and weigh it.\u000a  Exactly. Which one's going to weigh the most? The one that has the most sugar, okay? If you take equal volumes, this one will weigh the most. This will be the most dense. The more sugar you add, the denser it gets. You know this, right? Does anybody have any more? Alright, let's move on. Set number two. Now this says "solid" and I'm trying to get you to see a different range on these. Go ahead and talk about it. I'll give you a minute or so.\u000a  Colors? \u000a  Conductivity?\u000a We could root the potassium chloride out with conductivity.\u000a Well, they're solid. You have to remember. So, solid has a lot of problems with it.\u000a  That's just...solving it.\u000a  It's hard to conduct a current.\u000a  Well you could dissolve it--\u000a  It's doable. It's just a little difficult.  Potassium.\u000a Then um...\u000a  Wait, calcium.\u000a What about pH sensing? So CACL2.\u000a Well they're solids.\u000a Oh, if you put them into a solvent?\u000a Yeah. Can we put them into solvents? Can we make it into--\u000a So, lead can't dissolve in water, right?\u000a Lead?\u000a  I mean lead chloride.\u000a  No, lead chloride will not dissolve in water.\u000a  But then KCL and CACL2 would?\u000a They would.\u000a So, you can rule that out. That's one way. But then how do you figure out between the other solution?\u000a Couldn't there be a bigger concentration of chloride and then you could form a precipitate?\u000a I wouldn't say form a precipitate, I would say...  Actually, I'm thinking you can hybridize the fact the lead chloride doesn't dissolve at all with boiling point elevation, freezing point depression because you're going to have more little bits in the CACL2 than the KCL.\u000a As an end result, calcium chloride, potassium chloride get what? PBCL2 does nothing. So, after that if you boil it, right? Calcium chloride, potassium, the higher value.\u000a  Alright you guys. That's it. Let's gather up. Okay. Some of you guys just got back, so you guys know what we're doing, right?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Okay. Let's get it together. Alright, everybody stop now. Christina, you had your hand up first. Take the easiest one. What's the easiest way to distinguish these?\u000a You could take equal amounts of each of them and weigh them, and then PBCL2 would be the heaviest, and the KCL would be the lightest.\u000a  Equal volumes?\u000a I mean equal amounts.\u000a  What's an amount, though?\u000a Like grams. \u000a  But if I take equal grams, then I could have ten grams of this, ten grams of this, ten grams of that.\u000a No, I didn't say that. \u000a  Alright, what did you say then?\u000a I meant like equal--\u000a  Equal what?\u000a Volume.\u000a  Volume, okay. Now let's answer that one. What do you guys think? She's saying take, let's say 10 milliliters, 10 milliliters, 10 milliliters. And this one's going to weigh the most. This one would weigh, which one's second?\u000a  Oh, sorry. Second would be CACL2.\u000a Okay, so this one would be second. What do you guys think? Someone other than Ian?  Okay Ian, go ahead.\u000a Does atomic weight, atomic mass directly influence--\u000a  Listen to this, Miles.\u000a Does atomic mass directly influence density?\u000a  That's the question. Does the formula mass have anything to do with the density of these solids? They're all ionic compounds. And the answer to that is no. You cannot assume that because this has the highest formula mass, that this is the most dense. Okay? Where, just to follow that up, where could you use formula mass in relationship to density in a pattern that works?\u000a Ivan? Oh wait, let's give it to him. Just, he's just walked in. Niresh?\u000a Is it in gases?\u000a  Gases, right? Does everybody agree? Gases, you could do that. If the formula mass is high on a gas, then it's going to have more density. Could you do that for liquids, now? Could you do that for liquids? Ivan?\u000a You could do it if it's all the same subsets for different concentrations.\u000a

V  How much bigger is one than the other?\u000a It\u2019s like a thousand times.\u000a  It\u2019s like four times. Wait.\u000a Those zeros are really skinny \u000a Well, they weren\u2019t too bad. It\u2019s quite a big difference isn\u2019t it? So, is our picture drawn to scale?\u000a No.\u000a No. Can we make judgments on what\u2019s happening by our picture?\u000a No.\u000a  Not unless its drawn to scale, right? Rachel, how would we redraw that to make it more in line with our numbers?\u000a \u000a  Which side is bigger?\u000a The one with the negative \u000a  Okay, so we want to make that three times seven to  the sixth minus six much smaller, right?\u000a Yes. Would you please redraw. Make it about a fourth of the size.\u000a  I\u2019ll try.\u000a  You can just do a new one. Don\u2019t forget arrow tips please. Okay. Now does that picture help us understand why our hypotenuse is almost the same as the side? Okay, so, do we use our picture to make judgments?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, only if it's to scale. Thank you, ma\u2019am. Okay, Sam. You understand that? Okay. Alright, now one more thing we needed to do for the- Yeah. Go ahead.\u000a That hypotenuse has got a curve. \u000a It\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll make allowances. He doesn\u2019t have a straight edge up at the board.\u000a Okay, Raci, what else do we have to do here?\u000a  Find the direction.\u000a Find the direction. Raci, how would we go about doing that? \u000a  Okay so tangent... \u000a No, that\u2019s fine. We can use tangent. Which numbers will we use then? \u000a Okay. And-\u000a Pardon me?\u000a Are we trying to find the hypotenuse right now?\u000a  No.\u000a  We, well, yeah, we\u2019re going to. We just didn\u2019t write it that way. To solve for Theta we would do inverse tangent okay? Now, what do I tell you always to do with this? Make sure...\u000a It\u2019s in degrees.\u000a  In degrees. A couple of you had it in radians.\u000a That\u2019s because in Precal, we .\u000a  I understand that, but- So. Okay, now we have the angle. Is that the angle of the resultant?\u000a No.\u000a  What would you do, Jonah?\u000a 180.\u000aAdd 180 because?  It\u2019s in the third quadrant. Drew would you agree with that?\u000a Yes.\u000a Because?\u000a Because the resulting forces can\u2019t-- They can\u2019t, there\u2019s no forces in the other quadrants, so the resulting force couldn\u2019t possibly be in another quadrant.\u000a Okay, but how do we measure that angle? Counter clockwise from East. Okay good. Alright. Any questions? Sam?\u000a Question. I didn\u2019t add the 180, but then I put my answer as a certain number of degrees southwest.\u000a That would be fine. So you can do south of west also because it defines where that angle is. Alright? Now, do you guys feel better about this problem? Okay. John?\u000a Can you measure that from? I said it was... I\u2019m pretty sure this is incorrect, but 12 and a half degrees west of south. I mean, now that I realize it's...\u000a Yes, you could have. I guess it's technically the same thing.\u000a It would have been west of south. Did I mark it wrong?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Alright, well just show it to me later. I might have just missed that angle there. Okay. I\u2019ll make that correction for you, John. Okay. Let\u2019s go on. Jonah? Jake, thank you. Jonah, you\u2019re going to the board for this one.\u000a What should I write?\u000a We can erase all of number one.  Taylor, would you please read the problem for us?\u000a  Sure. A proton accelerates from rest in a uniform electric field of 640... What does that say?\u000a Newtons over Coulombs. \u000a Okay, let\u2019s stop there for a second. Hold on. Don\u2019t erase the nanocoulombs. You see the difference between an \u2018N\u2019 slash \u2018C\u2019 and a lower case \u2018nc\u2019? Sometimes, if you\u2019re reading too fast you are going to mess those up. I do it myself. So, always take a good look at the units. Units help inform you what you have. Okay, thank you.\u000a  At some later time its speed is 1.2 times 10 to the second . For A, you have to find the magnitude of the acceleration of a proton. For B, how long does it take the proton to reach the speed? C, how far has it moved in an interval? And D, what is the kinetic energy at the later time?\u000a Okay so, Connor. Calling on you again here. Magnitude of the acceleration. How would we go about finding acceleration normally if I just said, Connor tell me how to find acceleration? What\u2019s the first stuff that comes to mind?\u000a  \u2018f\u2019 equals \u2018m\u2019 \u2018a\u2019.\u000a \u2018f\u2019 equals \u2018m\u2019 \u2018a\u2019. Okay, or \u2018a\u2019 equals-\u000a  \u2018f\u2019 over \u2018m\u2019.\u000a  \u2018f\u2019 over \u2018m\u2019. Jonah, \u2018a\u2019 equals \u2018f\u2019 over \u2018m\u2019. We\u2019re working with a proton. Mass isn\u2019t given in the problem, but is that going to be an issue for us?\u000a No.\u000a  No, because that\u2019s our table of equations. So the mass of a proton: 1.67 times 10 to the minus 27 kg. So, we have that part, but we don\u2019t have the force. So Rachel, how might we find the force?\u000a Isn't the 'e' equals 'f' over 'q', so we can use the charge of the proton to find the .\u000a To find the charge, and what\u2019s e?\u000a It\u2019s a constant. No, no, no its not a constant. Oh, isn\u2019t it the 640 newtons over coulombs, right?\u000a And what does e represent, Rachel?\u000a The electric field.\u000a Electric field, good. So, if we solve this for force, what is that going to be? F equals- Okay, you can plug numbers in first too, that\u2019s good.\u000a Jonah. Can you slow down for some of us, please?\u000a Yeah, Jonah, you\u2019re not supposed to be looking at your sheet, so put your sheet down. What did Jonah just write up there? \u000a Okay, he went too fast. So let\u2019s back up.\u000a He plugged in the variables.\u000a He plugged in the numbers. But do we all know where that equation came from?\u000a Green sheet.\u000a Green sheet. And 'e' is the?\u000a Electric field.\u000a Good okay. And 'f'?\u000a Force.\u000a 'q'.\u000a The charge of a proton.\u000a Alright. So, now do you all know the charge of the proton?\u000a It\u2019s equal to the charge of an electron.\u000a Very good, alright now we can find force, right? What was the force then?\u000a 6.13 times 10 to the 10th?\u000a I got 1.02 times 10 to the ninth.\u000a That's the acceleration.\u000a Oh, my bad. Yeah, I was doing acceleration.\u000a F equals?\u000a 1.67.\u000a 1.024. How did I get this problem right? Oh, there it is right there. 1.024 x 10 to the negative 16th.\u000a And that brings up another good point. Write your work more clearly, right? Because if you can\u2019t follow your own, how do you expect me or the AP reader to do that? So, do yourself a favor. Make sure its clear. Okay. Where do we go from here, Ann? Back to a equals f over m. And we have force and we have mass now, right?  Okay, now I have led you through the problem solving steps for number one and number two A. John, lead your classmates through 2 B.\u000a Okay. 2 B. You have... Do you want me to lead the class?\u000a I want you to ask questions. Don\u2019t tell us. I want you to ask questions, okay?\u000a Okay. So, you need to find time. So, what equation would you use?\u000a Jonah, stop using the sheet.\u000a No, I told him he could use it.\u000a Wouldn\u2019t it be velocity equals acceleration times time?\u000a It is.\u000a Yes. \u000a Oh, come on Jonah, don\u2019t... It's actually v o times x, times t, not x v o times t.\u000a That\u2019s right.\u000a Isn\u2019t it v o times t?\u000a You are thinking of the equation for displacement. Oh yeah, x times v o. Well v o is zero because it's from rest.\u000a Alright, Drew what would you plug in?  The speed that you\u2019re given at the beginning of the problem and you found the acceleration. Oh, the speed is 1.2 x 10 to the sixth, and then you plug the acceleration you found from the previous problem, into that equation and solve it. \u000a So, t equals...\u000a No, John\u2019s leading.\u000a Class what does t equal?\u000a 1.96 times 10 to the negative fifth.\u000a Negative fifth or negative seven?\u000a Five.\u000a Alright, Sam, you lead for part C. Read part C. You lead.\u000a Part C. How far has it moved in the interval? And if you look up to the problem, nope you don\u2019t have to look up to the problem. You look up to number B which we just did. Number B. Yes, you do. Number B, and you look at the time that we just found, and that\u2019s going to be the interval. Thank you, Jonah. So, how are we gonna find time, Ann? Or distance? Sorry, distance.\u000a Why\u2019d you ask me a question?\u000a You told me to ask you a question.\u000a No, I didn\u2019t.\u000a Alright, anyone else know? Gretchen, you look like you know. What\u2019s the equation to find distance in number C?\u000a Distance equals velocity times time.\u000a Nope. That's not what I got. But, I guess you could do that. You could do that.\u000a No, you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t do that.\u000a Why not? Because I was gonna do that at first Gretchen, but then I thought in my head, that since the object\u2019s accelerating, the velocity is not going to be constant throughout the path of the travel. I have an equation.\u000a You have an equation, Ann?\u000a I do.\u000a What is it?\u000a How about x equals, x, the original x plus v o times, times t plus one half 'a' 'v' squared.\u000a So, what do we know about v o and x o, Ann?\u000a That they are just zero.\u000a So what can we do to both those first parts of the equation?\u000a Just throw them out the window.\u000a Drop it like a bad habit.\u000a Drop it like it's hot.\u000a So, that would be half times acceleration times time squared. And conveniently, letter A, letter A we found the acceleration which was what, Drew?\u000a 6.13 x 10 to the 10. Nice.  is just  and the time in letter B. What was it Raci?\u000a 1.93 times 10 to the negative .\u000a So, if you pound that out on the calc...\u000a Can we just pound it out?\u000a You cannot just pound it out because you have to...\u000a Do what, Miranda?\u000a I don\u2019t know, .\u000a Put the square in there?\u000a Change back to degrees?\u000a Oh, you snuck it in.\u000a Snuck what in?\u000a The square.\u000a I don\u2019t think I said the square. No I didn\u2019t, but Jonah thank you for saying the square for me. Pound that out in sig fig-wise, what do you get?\u000a I got 11.8.\u000a 11.7.\u000a John.\u000a If acceleration does matter, couldn\u2019t you also use the equation  v t? Because I also did that and I got the same.\u000a D equals one. Write it on the board, please. D equals? What\u2019s d?  I know it works. I just don't know how it works. I\u2019m going to tell you in a second. One half v average times t. So, why will this also work, then? Let\u2019s get some of your thoughts. Ann?\u000a Because if it\u2019s the average, then it\u2019s looking at the middle velocity instead of the top and bottom so you just-\u000a Wait a minute.\u000a It\u2019s the average velocity; and really the equation is  the quantity vo plus v times t.\u000a Yeah, that\u2019s what I wrote down.\u000a Right and so you take into account the acceleration with the change in velocity.\u000a So, wait a minute. If the equation is  vo plus v?\u000a Then you just get rid of the .\u000a No.\u000a Yeah, you do.\u000a  v plus vo times t.\u000a  the quantity vo plus v.\u000a Times t would just be v average times t.\u000a Okay, let\u2019s write the whole equation out. John, one half parenthesis v o plus v end parenthesis t.\u000a Then isn\u2019t  vo plus v just v average?\u000a So, t equals v average times t.\u000a Not  v average? \u000a No.\u000a Yes.\u000a But vo plus v divided by 2... \u000a Oh okay. I\u2019m sorry. I see what you mean. I missed that. Yes, sorry. But it can\u2019t just be final velocity. Okay. Is there another equation we could\u2019ve used? I saw some of the other ones on your sheets that worked.  Anybody in this class have one of the other ones? Jonah, did you?\u000a You could do V squared equals 2 a x.\u000a  So another way, v squared eqals 2 a x and solve for x, right? Good job, so you can see there\u2019s multiple ways of getting at the same answer, right? And D, letter D. I'll have Gretchen lead.\u000a  Letter D is asking to find the kinetic energy at the later time. So, what equation would you use? Sam?\u000a  Would it be kinetic energy equals  times the mass of the object times the velocity of the object squared?\u000a Yes. And then if we know the mass of the object of the proton from the first equation and that was?\u000a 1.67 x 10 -27 kilograms.\u000a Thank you for using the unit.\u000a And then we found the velocity in letter...\u000a Given.\u000a Or it was given, right. So 1.2 x 10 to the 6th...\u000a Meters per second.\u000a Thank you.\u000a Squared.\u000a And then you can just plug that into your calculator.\u000a Sig figs 1.2 times 10 to the negative 15th gs or kilogram meters per second.\u000a  Meters squared over seconds squared. Don\u2019t forget you have to square the units.\u000a Kilogram meters squared over seconds squared?\u000a Kilograms meters squared over seconds squared. Yeah.\u000a What is kilogram meters per second?\u000a You have to convert the meters.\u000a I could have sworn kilogram meters per second was something.\u000a Oh, momentum.\u000a That\u2019s not what we\u2019re looking for though, right?\u000a No, it\u2019s not. No, we\u2019re good.\u000a Okay, now. Better understanding?\u000a Yes.\u000a You gotta stay on top of stuff. You can\u2019t let those distractions get to you. Okay. Pass your quizzes to the front face down. I\u2019ll put them in your files for you.\u000a Do you want to see ?\u000a I\u2019ll take yours separate.\u000a Are we allowed to retake them?\u000a Pardon me?\u000a Can we retake them?\u000a Sure. Thank you. \u000a You gave me a minus six.\u000a Well...\u000a I had everything .\u000a Okay now, we are starting the next chapter today, so I have some handouts to give to you. \u000a Do we have till this Friday to retake the last test?\u000a Yeah, and quarter ends on Friday, so anything you guys need...\u000a

V  Also causing habitat loss--\u000a Anyways.\u000a  Indirectly through our use of C02 emissions.\u000a It says that... It is a naturally occurring greenhouse gas and we want to keep that, right? We want to keep it naturally occuring, we just wanna work on our--\u000a  Levels.\u000a Yeah. Because our impact is not exactly natural.\u000a  It's not like we're trying to stop the unhuman-related processes. Just like, what we're doing to increase it. Because like, it's been staying at a level until we started releasing a bunch of CO2, and then it went up, so it's kind of obvious that we're the cause of that. So, I don't think it's going to go down, then what it was before, normally.\u000a  Yeah, I think it's highly unlikely that this would ever happen.\u000a  Yeah, and 20 to 40 degrees Celsius is a lot, too.\u000a I highly doubt this would happen. If we reduce the CO2 emissions, in what we're doing, this is kind of ridiculous.\u000a  Give some more evidence for that.\u000a  Why?\u000a  Yeah, why? Explain why do you feel that way?\u000a Because carbon dioxide is part of the natural carbon cycle, yeah? But we're contributing to make more of it.\u000a  There's so many economies and stuff that are dependent on it right now, that are not going to get rid of it for a long time. Therefore, there wouldn't be such a drastic change in the amounts of carbon dioxide, that there wouldn't be a drop of 20 to 40 degrees Celsius.\u000a  Because we don't plan to tamper with the natural... Flow of the carbon cycle. We just want to tamper with our  which will take a long time anyway. So, we're going to be up and up and up for a while.\u000a But we kind of already did tamper with the CO2, the natural ones, because yeah, we're trying to reduce our own personal emissions, now that we're doing it now, but we've already gone in and tampered with it. We've already cut down millions and millions of trees. We've already, so can we talk about... I'm trying to touch into what we've done in the past, and how if we kind of try and back out now, then we leave the Earth in a sticky situation. Does that make sense?\u000a  Well, I do have a question. I don't remember, does the greenhouse effect exist naturally, even as like a little bit, right?\u000a  Yeah, we just made it bigger.\u000a So it's like, they're claiming that without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average temperature would drop drastically, well obviously because the greenhouse effect exists naturally, but we're making so much of the greenhouse effect that we're trying to bring it down to normal levels. We're not trying to bring it down below normal levels. I think they're saying that this is going to happen if it's below the normal level, but the problem is that we are already above the normal level, so if we bring it down, it's not going to make it a complete effect anyway.\u000a  I mean, they are right saying that it's going to get significantly below, as everyone said, it's not going to be to the point where life will not exist. But I mean, the process by which sun penetrates the earth, like some of the heat is retained because of that effect. And what we're doing is enabling the Earth to retain more heat than it normally does. So by releasing some of it, by reducing emissions, we are making the Earth much, much cooler.\u000a  But we also can't get rid of the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere. So, those would stay there, and our temperature probably wouldn't drop as much, probably still would drop, maybe not as extreme.\u000a  And also, we live in a world where we use so much carbon dioxide, there's no way that we're going to get it to the level of just the natural processes. I mean, at least not in a ten year period.\u000a  I was wondering how long it thought we were going to slow so-called global warming. It doesn't really give us a projection.\u000a  I don't think we're going to have another ice age for a long time.\u000a  I mean, we're having a mass extinction as it is, the way we are right now. I think if anything, reducing it would help stop the mass extinction.\u000a I think we've kind of talked about all we can at this point.\u000a Alright, so, at this point, if you feel like you have talked a lot, in an effort to get you to stop, I'm going to have you actually, I want you to scoot your chair back like a foot or two, for the next one, to give some other people a chance to talk. Yeah, I have two, you want the good ones with lotion?\u000a The next one, sorry, is, "Concerns over CO2 emissions are unfounded." Somebody want to read?\u000a Okay. "Concerns over CO2 emissions are unfounded. "Water vapor is a leading greenhouse gas. "Today, Mythbusters Daily exclusively reveals "what climate scientists have been hiding from the public. "Water vapor is actually a much more prevalent "and potent greenhouse than carbon dioxide. "Water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere "between 30,000 to 40,000 ppm, "while maximum estimates "put CO2 around 370 ppm. "Due to its abundance, water vapor's "a much more important greenhouse gas, "so human inputs of CO2 are negligible. "We should stop focusing on CO2, "and refocus research and funding "on reducing the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere." \u000a Would that be parts per million for ppm?\u000a Yeah, parts per million.\u000a Water vapor unit, really, really. Okay. We have a whole water cycle, I know we have the whole carbon cycle and everything, but we have contributed so much to the carbon cycle. I mean, and global warming hasn't really been a problem until recently, gee, I wonder why? Maybe because, I don't know, we are emitting a lot of carbon. I mean, it's not like we've been emitting more water, you can't create more water. Okay. Yeah, I'm done, I'm sorry.\u000a  I think if you explained what the greenhouse effect actually is it will disprove the water vapor theory. Because the way the greenhouse effect works is completely unrelated with water vapor.\u000a  How?\u000a  Well, because like, isn't the greenhouse gas a gas that lets in sunlight, but it prevents the heat from leaving, or whatever or something right? But water doesn't, I don't think water does that.\u000a I thought it was a greenhouse gas. We learned about that in chapter 20. But... We did it on the worksheet, maybe, or the thing that we had for homework last night. It's considered a greenhouse gas. That's all I know.\u000a  You know what effect it had?\u000a Sorry.\u000a No, it is a greenhouse gas. I remember reading that. But--\u000a  You can grab a textbook, if you'd like.\u000a  Keep talking, Elizabeth.\u000a Water vapor has always been there. It has always been at this level. Am I wrong?\u000a  Well, I mean, if our CO2 emissions are increasing, and global warming is happening, then you would be releasing more water vapor. I mean, heat would cause that to happen.\u000a But then technically this is an effect, it's not a cause, then.\u000a  Is it possible to be both?\u000a Maybe.\u000a  Like a positive feedback loop?\u000a  What do you know about water vapor?\u000a  It's a greenhouse gas. We know that now.\u000a Isn't it when water evaporates.\u000a  Clouds. \u000a  Nope, that is an excellent point.\u000a Hold on, you guys, what do clouds do? They block sunlight. \u000a So, if the global temperatures rise, there would be more water vapor, because there would be more fluctuations of creating water vapor?\u000a  Don't look at me, look at your people. And people who are on the outside are not supposed to be talking.\u000a  Well, just like--\u000a  Well, she can finish.\u000a  Sorry, sorry, no go ahead.\u000a Go ahead, finish. She said  you could finish.\u000a Oh, Okay. Well, when water vapor, think about it, when you like boil water, it's hot, and it creates water vapor. So, increases in global temperature, there would be a possible connection between increased temperature and increased water vapor.\u000a Hot air rises.\u000a Which way would it be though? Because if increasing temperature causes increase in water vapor, does that mean increase in water vapor causes increase in temperature?\u000a  Well, you said that water vapor is clouds, so wouldn't, clouds would block sunlight, so wouldn't that decrease temperature? But that's kind of like contradictory.\u000a  Can that happen, though?\u000a  Like how hot air rises, and cold air drops, so maybe, forgot what that process is called.\u000a  Well, it's like sometimes when you're on like islands, or something that it's like all cloudy, but still really hot and humid, so maybe it can increase the temperature. \u000a  I have a question. At what altitude do clouds form?\u000a It depends. I mean they can form at ground level. That's what's basically fog.\u000a  What's the highest altitude that clouds are going to reach? For the most part, like on average?\u000a I have no idea, that is an excellent question.\u000a  But like what part of their, is it under the stratosphere?\u000a There's a laptop over there if you guys want to get it. No one's ever asked me that. That's a really good question. I don't know. I know that they're throughout the troposphere, but I'm not sure how high up in the stratosphere they go. That's a really good, I don't know.\u000a  Can I read something really quick? "Four natural greenhouse gases in the troposphere "are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, "and nitrous oxide. "These gases have been present, in varying concentrations "in the troposphere during most of the Earth's long history. "Fluctuations in the troposphere, "concentration of these gases, especially carbon dioxide "and methane, plus changes in solar output "are the major factors causing new changes "in the average temperature of the troposphere "over the past 400,000 years." And then it just talks about how from the beginning of the industrial revolution, human actions have led to significant increases in carbon dioxide, and therefore it correlates the relation to the increase in temperature of the globe.\u000a I just read another thing. "Additional clouds can have a warming effect, "positively back by absorbing and releasing heat "into the troposphere. "Or a cooling effect, a negative effect, "by reflecting more sunlight back into space." So, they can have a warming effect.\u000a So, should we be worried about water vapor more than carbon dioxide?\u000a  No.\u000a Why?\u000a  Because doesn't the CO2 cause the warming, which, never mind.\u000a  No no, keep going. That was good, keep going.\u000a  That was it.\u000a  Okay. \u000a Well, based on what she just read, and based on everything we know about carbon dioxide, we know that carbon dioxide can lead to a lot of effects. A lot of them bad. And one of the major things is that it does lead to more water vapor, and if water vapor is such an issue in terms of global temperature increase, then you would think their first thought would be decrease carbon dioxide emissions. But, no.\u000a Can we directly regulate water vapor?\u000aNo. Can we directly regulate CO2?\u000a Yeah, we can decrease our emissions. We can switch to alternative vehicles. We can find other sources of energy. I mean there are a lot of options with water vapor, we just have a water cycle. We can't tell the water vapor to stop rising into the clouds, like, "Yeah, can you just pause for a moment?" No, we can't do that, because it's a natural cycle.\u000a  Are we done with that one?\u000a So, what do we have so far, Nida?\u000a Well, that heat would cause the release of more water vapor, and clouds can trap and release heat, but they can also cool. And concluded that clouds are water vapor, first of all.  What we were saying, should we worry about water vapor more so than CO2? Probably not, because we can regulate CO2, but not water vapor. And water's a greenhouse gas.\u000a I call that using science. \u000a  I have a question for you. In nuclear power plants, how the steam comes from the cooling tower. Is that water vapor emission?\u000a That is considered a water vapor emission.\u000a  Okay, so maybe we could control that aspect of it, control the steam.\u000a One additional thing to just sort of keep in mind, and we'll talk about this later, is what we call residence time. Does anyone know what that is? Residence time is how long a chemical stays in wherever it is. And so one of the things that we're concerned about, when we look at a chemical, is its residence time. So, if we're talking about a water pollutant, what's the residence time? How long is it going to stay in water? Is it going to break down quickly, or is it going to be very persistent, and is it gonna last for a really long time? So, when we were looking at greenhouse gases, we're also looking at what's the residence time in the atmosphere. How long does an average molecule stay in the atmosphere? And water vapor tends to cycle in and out of the atmosphere a lot quicker than some of our other greenhouse gases. Its cycles are usually on the order of days, whereas others are on the order of months to years, versus like, do you guys know what CFCs are? The ozone-depleting compounds. Chlorofluorocarbons, we'll talk more about those as well. CFCs are also a greenhouse gas, but their residence time in the atmosphere is more like hundreds of years. Hundreds of years to thousands of years. That would be something we would be more concerned about.\u000a  So like, the residence time of something radioactive could be like its half life?\u000a Yep. And then a third factor that we look at is also how potent of a greenhouse gas it is. Some gases have more warming potential, and some gases have less warming potential. So, we also want to look at what is its potential for heat trapping versus its concentration? And we'll talk a little more about that, too. Alright, we have two left. I'd actually like for you to pick one. I'm thinking maybe you should do the freezing temps one, because we already kind of talked about the cloudy one, but if you want to do the cloudy one you can do the cloudy one.\u000a  You suggest the freezing temperature one?\u000a That's my suggestion, but I won't be upset if you overrule me.\u000a Let's do freezing temperatures.\u000a Does anybody want to write--\u000a

V Well, let's say about like a plane. A plane can use the wing to, like, slice right through the, the wind, making it just fly with ease, but let's say the wing was vertical, and then it would just be working like a parachute and just stop its fall.\u000a Okay, did everybody hear what he said?\u000a No.\u000a Daniel, did you understand what Jonathan was saying?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, so does that make sense to you then, Daniel?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, John?\u000a About the thing, the last part, did he say vertical?\u000a Yeah, like, like, like, vertical, like pointing upwards.\u000a Oh. Okay.\u000a What do you think? Reese, what do you think?\u000a Um, what Jonathan said?\u000a Jonathan, would you kind of say it again? Reese would really like to pay attention and he'd like to hear.\u000a Yeah, I'm saying, like, like a wing, it uses, like, like, like a V shape of a duck, of a duck squad. Like every single wing goes down each part and then it's just like a V.\u000a Okay.\u000a Shayla?\u000a Um, I said they fly because the air pressure in the wings gives it stability to keep stable and make sure it doesn't fall onto the ground.\u000a Okay. Kelsey?\u000a Um, I think that if the aerospace vehicle was in space then I think it would just float in space because there's no gravity.\u000a Okay, we're kind of... yeah, Ramaji?\u000a Okay, I'm kind of lost...\u000a Ramaji is lost, let's help her find herself. No, that's a good thing. Because, I'll be honest, I'm a little lost. So tell me where you are.\u000a Like, I thought we were supposed to put, like, why we think they were built, not how they were built, like, like, I wrote, um, I think aerospace vehicles fly to improve society and help, and new aerospace technology helps build modern things.\u000a Okay. Can everybody understand where Ramaji went with her answers? Kelsey?\u000a I'm totally lost now.\u000a Okay, here's what happened, okay, so let me see if we can find this a different direction. Um, in reading all your different sentences, most of us had a purpose for aerospace vehicles flying, okay, or some of you wrote that they fly both in space and in the air, okay, and so we're not kind of getting where I want to get to. So can I, for a second, kind of change the discussion? Just because... Yes, John?\u000a Is it, like, when you take a rocket, like, on the rocket it has, uh... two wings and like one tail?\u000a Great, so, his question that he asked, does a rocket have two wings and a tail? Um, here's what's happening. Mm, I thought the vehicles would help you, and what I'm seeing is, having the vehicles is making you try to figure out what it is about how this vehicle was made. And I'm not as concerned about how this vehicle is made, okay, as I am the science behind how it flies and why we design it that way, does that make sense?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay, so can we go a different way with me for a minute? Each of you has a picture of a hot air balloon on your table, correct? Okay. I know, I took yours, Reese, which is why you don't have one now. I need to know something, okay? This vehicle doesn't have an engine, okay? Okay? Now, I want you to think about this for a minute, and I want you to discuss it at your table before we talk whole group. I want to know how does this hot air balloon fly, how does it get in the air, and how does it stay in the air? And is it possible you don't know anything about this?\u000a Possibly?\u000a Possibly. It is possible, okay, it is possible, Joelle, you don't know anything about this, okay. So I want your table group to share what you know for a couple of minutes about a hot air balloon and how it flies, okay? And I'm gonna come around and talk to different groups, okay? So how does this hot air balloon fly?  Okay, so you two start the discussion at this table.  So, discuss that, because some of us did have a good concept and some of us don't, okay? So share in your group. Okay, what do you two know?  Okay. Has an engine, a propulsion engine?  Okay, but is that an engine?  Okay, so now you can do your discussion. What did you come up with over here?  So the fire blows hot air into the balloon.  Okay, without it, it would do what? It would fall down, okay. Okay? So, any idea why the hot air makes the balloon rise? What do you think?  Okay, okay.  Ooh, that was awesome. You are so good today. Um, I think we're now getting somewhere. So let's talk about this hot air balloon for a minute, okay. So, I've heard some different things around the classroom, I want to know how does that balloon get into the air? Nathan?\u000a The fire in the hot air balloon blows the, the balloon up to where it can float down.\u000a Okay, Shayla, do you agree or disagree?\u000a I agree with that, because, yeah, because you pull on a cord and like, it lights up the fire and stuff, and then the fire pulls in air and it, like, shoots it up with the fire.\u000a So, is the fire being shot into the hot air balloon?\u000a No, air is.\u000a What kind of air?\u000a Hot air.\u000a Hot air is being shot up into this part. Okay. John?\u000a Didn't they say one of those, like if you compare...\u000a They can't, Jonathan can't hear you.\u000a Oh, sorry. If you compare a hot air balloon and a balloon, they're, you use hot air for the air balloon, and you use the helium for a small balloon, yeah, and the, it's not really air, kind of, I thought it was steam.\u000a Okay, okay. Now why would you think it was steam?\u000a Because you know how when you just, um, when you put like a fire, fire in one place, it sometimes can turn into steam? Maybe?\u000a The fire turns into steam?\u000a No, not the fire, but like when it's, when it's done...\u000a Ann Maria says she thinks you need the word "water."\u000a Yeah, because when you heat up water, then steam comes up out of it. Because steam is, like, moisture.\u000a Steam is like moisture that's...\u000a In the air.\u000a In the air, okay. Ramaji?\u000a I agree with you, John.  Okay, I think what he's saying is, because in air and the fire is there or whatever, and so then when they're getting pushed up that comes and like, then... I'm lost here! Okay, like then the steam, like, yeah, you were right about the moisture part, but it, but there is no way that, like, water is in this...\u000a There isn't water in there!\u000a Yeah, I mean...\u000a Reese, be supportive. \u000a I mean, there's moisture in the air, but still, like... fire is a big part of it!\u000a Okay, can I ask a question? Okay? Do I need water in order for the hot air balloon to fly?\u000a No, no you don't!\u000a Ramaji says no, Laura says no?\u000a I said no.\u000a Mariah says no. Kelsey?\u000a I'm totally lost! \u000a Kelsey, it's okay to be lost, okay. Kelsey, you're, if you're lost, you need to know where you are. So here's the question, what do you feel like you know and understand about what's been discussed so far?\u000a I thought I was understanding everything until John said... I'm so confused right now!\u000a So tell me...\u000a John was talking about steam.\u000a John was talking about steam. I would agree, Kevin, John was talking about steam. So the question is, prior to that, Kelsey, okay, prior to that, what would be your understanding of how the hot air balloon flies?\u000a Basically, nothing before that, I just think it's steam, because of like hot and air, because, or like, there would be like a fire inside of the air and then it would be steamy...\u000a Okay, let's see if I can bring around some concepts. Ramaji and John, can you let me have two seconds, okay? Um, we have a concept of this fire that's heating air, but we also seem to have a concept of water that gets heated and creates steam. Correct? But I'm also hearing, and I just want to make sure I understand, I'm hearing that the steam isn't necessary for the balloon to go up. John?\u000a Well this is, this is how I thought it was steam. Because you know how sometimes there's clouds, and you, you want to go up in the air balloon, and sometimes it might rain, like when you're in the air balloon sometimes it, like, when you pass through a cloud and the air is super hot, it actually turns into steam I think.\u000a Okay. Ramaji?\u000a Okay.\u000a Listen, I've got to come over here.\u000a Okay, so like, like...\u000a You two can put your hand down for a minute and I'll go to you next.\u000a So like, steam is, I think it's putting pressure, like on the balloon to like, make it go up?\u000a So we feel like we have air pressure, okay.\u000a I don't agree with Ramaji though because with the air there's no steam involved, there's like, kinda like what John said, he said when the planes come up the hot air pushes it...\u000a Okay, I'm gonna ask... Oops, I didn't let you speak.\u000a Well, like, it's just like, like comparing this to a regular balloon, with helium it would float up just like an air balloon, but you can't put helium in an air balloon.\u000a Does everybody understand that? So if I put... okay, that is an awesome analogy! So everybody listen. If I put helium, helium is a...\u000a A gas!\u000a A gas, okay, helium is a gas, so if I take a regular rubber balloon and I put helium in it, the helium because it's a gas, helium floats, that makes my balloon float, right? Whereas if I just blow up a balloon, what happens? It just falls down on the ground and I got nothing, okay. On the flip side, Kevin, what she's saying is, with a hot air balloon, instead of filling it with helium, I'm filling it with hot air, okay? Now I have a question, I think you've got to think really deep about this one. If hot air, Reese, is what makes my hot air balloon go up, okay, I want to know, would it be easier for me to fly my hot air balloon on a warm day or on a cold day? Just think about it for a second, just think. Would it be easier for my hot air balloon, do you think, to fly on a hot day or a cold day?\u000a What about on a windy day?\u000a Ooh! Okay, she said what about on a windy day. Let's assume that there's a slight breeze, on either day, okay, but the temperature is either warm or the temperature is cold, okay? Kelsey?\u000a I personally think that it would be better to be on a hot day, because then the sun would be helping with all the hot air so then it would make the air inside the hot air balloon warmer to help it fly higher.\u000a So I'd get radiation into the balloon? Okay. Ramaji.\u000a I think a cold day.\u000a And why on a cold day?\u000a Because, like, there's not, I mean, even on hot days, there's still, like, low humidity sometimes, and so, like, it, you basically with fire would kind of... I don't know, not set your hair on fire, but like...  No, when it's cold there's no moisture in the air, so like, it would be, like, like helium, but like...\u000a Okay, Shayla?\u000a I think that it's a hot day. One of the reasons is because there's hot in the hot air balloon, and if it was on a cold day, there's a fire in the thing, in the hot air balloon, it could blow out the fire and that could make the whole thing just plummet to the ground, and people could die.\u000a Okay. Ann Maria?\u000a I think it would be better on a cold day, because, well, I don't know if this actually really makes sense, but, like, the hot air would be working against the cold air--\u000a Exactly!\u000a And like if it's on a hot day it would be like the same.\u000a Just a second. So Ann Maria, if the cold... if the warm air is in the hot air balloon, and it's a cold day, what would you expect to happen to the balloon?\u000a Go up.\u000a And why would you expect the balloon to go up on a cold day faster than on a hot day?\u000a Because... like, the hot air would be... pushing against the cold air, faster than it would be pushing against itself?\u000a Okay. Over here.\u000a I agree with Shayla on the hot day, because, like, a regular air balloon, just regular heat would make it go up, but if you had the sun hitting against it, I think, it would help with radiation, like the sun would help out...\u000a The fire?\u000a Yeah, how it has something to do with radiation.\u000a Okay.\u000a I think the sun hitting against the balloon would make it go up higher.\u000a Okay. Nathan?\u000a I think on a cold day, because it would give it less chance of popping from the hot air, that might pop it.\u000a Awesome. Kevin, what do you think?\u000a I think the same, hot air, because I've never seen a hot air balloon fly when it's cold.\u000a Okay. Dakota? Oh wait, Kevin, I have a question for you. How do you define a cold day? Okay, what's the, okay, here's my question, okay. You said you'd never seen a hot air balloon fly on a cold day, and what I'm asking is, is there a particular season that you would say the air would be too cold?\u000a Winter.\u000a Winter, okay. Dakota, what do you think?\u000a Uh, I think, uh...\u000a Kevin, Dakota can think on his own. I know he can.\u000a I don't know.\u000a Cold day, warm day, what do you think?\u000a I think a warm day, because it would be easier to fly?\u000a Okay, Daniel, what do you think? Cold day, warm day?\u000a I would say a cold day, because the hot air would meet the cold air, so it would be more enhanced, going up you'd get more from the hot air.\u000a Okay, I need to kind of bring this to a close real quick, and I know you two have lots to say, Tyree, did you want to add the last comment?\u000a Yeah. Uh, I think the hot day, because who would go out on a cold day, when the higher you get, the colder it gets.\u000a Okay, Tyree says who would go out on a cold day, because the higher you get, the colder you get, so Tyree's logic here is that if I'm going to go in a hot air balloon, I don't want to get really really cold. Okay, ladies, I know you have lots to add, okay, but I kind of want to bring this to a close, but I need to know a crucial question. So everybody has to commit to this question. I want you to-- don't do it until I tell you to! Ready? You're gonna hold, um, you're gonna hold your arm straight up if you believe the better day would be the warm day, and you're gonna hold your hand at the side of your shoulder if you believe it would be the cold day that would be the better day. I didn't say go yet! Okay, on three, everybody. So, does everybody understand? This is cold, this is warm, okay? Ready, one, two, three. Okay. Okay, now hands down. I have just two more questions, and then we're gonna close out today's lesson, okay. Question number one. I want to know if you've ever heard the word...\u000a

V In case you think there's something missing, and then we'll see what you got.\u000a Okay.\u000a The tongue does with the .\u000a The tongue? Oh yeah, because the trachea will swallow it. No, the trachea's the air....\u000a The esophagus close your...\u000a The esophagus is the food pipe for the thing.\u000a No, the esophagus is the thing that stops the food...\u000a The esophagus is the food part, the windpipe is the trachea.\u000a You talking about the epiglottis.\u000a Oh, the epiglottis!\u000a That's the flap of skin that stops it, food going down your trachea, your air passageway.\u000a So you don't choke.\u000a Right.\u000a How do you spell that?\u000a How do you spell what?\u000a Are you gonna put that in there somewhere? Well, here's what I'm talking about, you only need four people in this group, and you don't have as many pieces of paper. Don't take more without asking, why are you taking more? Why?\u000a Because Tyler got  on it.\u000a Go wash it in the sink. I'll mark down on my clipboard who's having trouble with self-control. Go to the sink and wash it with soap and water. All right, so you guys do not have the same number of papers that they have at the other table, because you only have four people, so I'm gonna let you add more. If you feel that you could add a few more pieces to fill it out more, go for it. And then I'll check in with y'all in just a minute.\u000a Add head.\u000a Yeah, but she said it has to be a word. What's another word for stomach acid?\u000a Stomach acid?\u000a Acid?\u000a Why don't you put acid?\u000a That could be anything.\u000a In your stomach?\u000a Stomach acid's kinda like a compound word.\u000a Well, actually, since stomach's already here, and if we put acid right here, you can't just say it's any kind of acid.\u000a Yeah, because it's going down the mouth, to the throat, to the... and they have acid in the stomach.\u000a Well, that's the intestine. Duh, acid. \u000a I'm gonna stop you right now, because we wanna take this to another level, but what I have is I have several groups with several different ways of looking at it. What seems to be a common thread among some of you is to order things, to put them in an order of sequence. I had one group that grouped them. So, what I'm asking is that, I'm still seeing a little bit of food in there, and I'm still seeing that you've got processes, some people have processes in there, and body parts, we got lots of body parts. So, what I'm gonna ask you to do is, if we could put, if we could create a big system on the board, with the pieces, and if there are duplicates, this is why I didn't want you sticking 'em too much, we just put it on top. So I'm gonna ask you to do this, this is gonna be tricky, we're not gonna have a lot of time, so I'm gonna ask you to bring, by groups, your Post-Its and put them on the board, this is our work space. So if you think it should be in, out five groups, four of you think it should be in a linear kind of grouping, so we're gonna go with the sequence of events order. So what I want you to do is put 'em on the board and let's look at what you've got, if there's duplicates, put it on top, if there's something you have that's different, figure out where, if you can move something, can it share a space, does it happen at the same time? We talked about it over there, what three things did you have?\u000a Esophagus, throat and neck.\u000a So they thought those were on equal grounds. That they were all, either in the same place, or the same function, I wasn't sure, I didn't ask them, but they've got them together. So, this is gonna be hard. It's real easy sitting there with your group of five or six or four people. Now you've gotta work with twenty-four, twenty-three. Okay? So, we're gonna start with Group One. And if you can just come stick 'em on the board, and I'm gonna get Group Four next. And you'll go up with them. So, you have to make one picture on this board that shows me how you think they fit. If you wanna put them in the same order, don't make them touch, leave enough room for manipulations. Yes?\u000a \u000a No. Pardon?\u000a \u000a The abdomen is the middle, the butt is the fleshy part. The anus is the actual opening, and the rectum is the tube. Yeah, so it's very distinct differences. They can't interchange. All right, so just stick 'em on, and then move quickly. Got 'em? All right, got 'em on? That's why I said, they're not going to stick well, if you keep sticking them on your face and get the oil from your face. All right? Make sure you agree. Now, you're gonna go up there with your Post-It notes. You may need to use some of their pieces, you're welcome to move any of their pieces, to fit in, since you're coming up there after them. And the group that comes after you will be free to move any of your pieces, okay? All right, y'all pay attention. All right. Got 'em? All right, can you do me a favor and plan before you get up here how you're gonna do it, so we can make it move quickly. All right, guys, have a seat. Now, they don't, they have some words you don't have. So how are you gonna make this work? You gonna put yours up above it?\u000a We're gonna put ours in our order, we could fit their's in there.\u000a There you go, however you wanna do it. Come up and get their voices.\u000a What's next, mouth? Water, where's water?\u000a I think we need mouth.\u000a I have teeth.\u000a Tongue, then teeth.\u000a Mouth.\u000a I have taste-buds. It was tongue, teeth, then chewing.\u000a It was tongue, then teeth.\u000a Saliva, it was saliva, saliva.\u000a Chewing. I think it was tongue, then saliva. No, It was tongue, taste-buds, saliva, teeth.\u000a Then chew. And then I think it was esophagus, next.\u000a I have intestine, stomach and waste.\u000a Stomach and then intestines and then waste.\u000a And then kidney, no put 'em on the same. All right, we put theirs up, now teeth, intestines...\u000a I'm gonna leave you guys for last over there, you have a smaller group, I'm gonna leave you for last. All right? \u000a All right, so health? Health should be overall, I guess it's like, yeah.\u000a Yeah, you get health from eating.\u000a Proteins go with food, no?\u000a Yeah, nutrients.\u000a How are you doing?\u000a It's kind of hard to put this in the same group with...\u000a So, you were looking linear, and now it's hard to go linear, because they've thrown these other things in. Yeah, you have a scrap board, what do you do? You might wanna build off.\u000a That's what I'm saying, or like, switching some, some of them are very vague.\u000a And that's exactly it. If they're vague, you're not quite sure how they tie in, you weren't there for their discussion. So you don't know what their train of thought was. So make it work. And realize that somebody's gonna come behind you, and they might change it.\u000a Let's put protein and nutrients. But health is overall.\u000a All right, this is getting very interesting. Their strategy...\u000a You have to realize, and I'll make the point while we're waiting for them to finish, because they're having their own discussions. When you have your discussion with your group, your having a discussion with a small group. So, when you get up there and you see a word, and you weren't there for the discussion that brought that word into the list, you weren't there, you don't know what their thinking was. So, just like we always say, you can't disregard somebody's input because you don't believe it should be there. You have to find a way, oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Thank you, I need you next, because y'all have the next least amount. Thank you for catching that. You have to make sure that what you do doesn't lose the meaning or change the meaning and doesn't judge somebody else's input, you have to just make it work. Grab it. If you know where it goes. All right, but if, by some chance, that's what happens when you start stacking, we can use this masking tape in little tiny pieces. All right, go for it.\u000a Ooh!\u000a Are you all right, is it still working? You're fine!\u000a Yes, we're okay.\u000a You lost a nose, we dropped a nose.\u000a A nose!\u000a But you see, it's OK, it may not have stood out in your discussion. And you might have brought something to the discussion that they didn't.\u000a Y'all gotta talk louder.\u000a Okay, nose should be here.\u000a Literally, put it right on top of it.\u000a Stomach, okay, teeth, chewing, epiglottis, esophagus, wait, esophagus, esophagus, wait.\u000a If you have to move something, or if you think it needs to be...\u000a This is the esophagus.\u000a In other words, if you think you have to move something over to fit yours in, because it's not there...\u000a And then...\u000a Intestines.\u000a And then acid.\u000a This word's already here. So right after the mouth?\u000a Then intestines, and then to the kidneys, and then to the waste, and then health.\u000a Do you wanna move it somewhere else? If you think something should be on the same plain, I just use the example of Scrabble game with them.\u000a I think saliva...\u000a I think water and food.\u000a Once you put it into your mouth, you're gonna get saliva.\u000a Okay, so, see what they did? So if you feel like you need to move anything, we need to get saliva back in there, so how's saliva gonna work?\u000a Saliva goes with taste-buds and mouth. And tongue!\u000a Put it, like, in the middle.\u000a Okay, it should stick. Wait, discuss, go ahead, tell them what you think.\u000a It looks like...\u000a Are y'all ready, are you almost ready?\u000a No.\u000a You do know, the more that get up there, the harder it gets.\u000a So you're making it harder for us?\u000a No, I'm making it harder for them.\u000a Oh!\u000a All right, I'm coming. Got it?\u000a They have like three on intestines.\u000a Let's put a little piece of tape to hold up the intestines. Yeah, just stick a little piece up at the top. It doesn't matter. And can you add this to the waste so it doesn't fall? All right, you guys, good? Okay, go! All right, how are y'all doing out there? Are you watching this unfold?\u000a Yeah.\u000a And Group One, I mean Three, Group Three? You guys look at the task ahead of you, it's gotten bigger.\u000a I need tape.\u000a All right, I'm gonna give you a little bit. I'd like you not to put too much on the board, more on the paper. You have to figure out, if you have a duplicate, then just tape it over the top of it. Anything that's duplicate. All right, all right.\u000a I need tape.\u000a You need tape, all right, so,\u000a Where do you put stomach?\u000a All right, so he's got a question about where to put stomach.\u000a No, I have stomach acid, I'm seeing where she's putting stomach.\u000a It's over here, this is acid.\u000a All right, so it's way down there. So move down there.\u000a I need some tape.\u000a And I will tell you the same thing I told the other two groups. Think about Scrabble. So if you have to go in a different direction to make something work, you just go in a different direction, you make it work. Okay, you guys have the hardest job. Or it might be the easiest.\u000a Mucus!\u000a Where does the gallbladder go?\u000a What is that, epiligotis, oh, my bad.\u000a But, look how much came out. That's good, we didn't have that much expansion on that idea before, all we had was body parts.\u000a Can we have tape for two?\u000a What do you need?\u000a Two pieces of tape.\u000a All right, two pieces of tape. All right, how we doing?\u000a Emily, where do I put mucus?\u000a Mucus goes with the, in between...\u000a The neck thing?\u000a Is that everything?\u000a All right, y'all ready?  Would you do me a favor and tell Mr. Dresser we need five more minutes? You have a test? Oh, tell him three minutes.  Thank you. So we need three minutes. You got it?\u000a Okay, I think it's good.\u000a All right, ready guys? All right, have a seat. Okay, now, everybody goes up, last group. Take your papers, go!\u000a I need a band-aid.\u000a For what?\u000a To put over my...\u000a Your what? Let me look and see if I have one. Sometimes you have those little bitty ones. Okay, I will look. If you need them... Thank you. All right, if you're stacking it and it won't stick, I have tape. Here, stick your mouth on that mouth.\u000a This we can put over this, can we change this?\u000a Yes. Use this, all right, you got it? Here, just put it like that. All right, how are y'all doing? What do you have left? Why don't you, Alex, would you lift up health and move my volcanoes, just slide the volcano down, it'll come off. Just slide it down. Now you can do it that way. Do you need more tape? All right, how are we doing? In case it doesn't stick. Got it? All right, now, I want you to, while you are waiting, and I appreciate the patience that you guys have had, I want you to watch and look at what it looks like now. Because some of you made some significant placements and they've made some significant changes to that. So take a look at what the resulting image is here. Y'all finished?\u000a Wait, don't you think this should be over there?\u000a That's right, they get to, you have your perspective and they're bringing theirs to it. And they had, what could have been the hardest part, or the easiest part. Okay, I wanna pick up on one thing that you guys said, because one of the things that you had, when you came here, and the group was already, had already laid all this out, was that they felt strongly that the mouth needed to be here. So why?\u000a Because food goes in there.\u000a  Paging Mrs. Dalton, Dalton come in.\u000a I'm sorry, hold on. Try it again.\u000a Like if you're eating something like a hamburger or you're drinking water, it's gonna go straight to your mouth, and then, it goes in there.\u000a So in the order that we've established here, do you see what they did? Do you agree with that?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Is it logical?\u000a Yeah.\u000a OK, is there anything else that you placed, that you recognize was changed? And you wanna know why it was changed. Or you went, "Oh!" Because I did hear a lot of, "Oh, we didn't think of that," when you were watching these things go up.\u000a Like at first, I thought that that should go before that.\u000a Don't know "that," I don't know what "that" is.\u000a Um, the glucose, water, and food.\u000a Okay, this column of...\u000a Yes, I thought that that should go before the mouth, because, I was like, "But don't you put it in, "don't you put the food in your mouth?" And they were like, "Yeah, but once it enters your body, "it's not first in the..."\u000a Okay, using that logic, is there anything else that should be adjusted? Blair?\u000a Uh, where the nose is?\u000a Okay, what do you think we should do with that?\u000a You should put the nose right before the mouth, or after, because it's like, you kinda smelled it before you put it in your mouth.\u000a So would this be logical if I moved this over and put this here, like he suggested.\u000a Yes.\u000a I want to disagree.\u000a You disagree, you're welcome to.\u000a Smelling it, is not a part of digesting it, at all.\u000a Yeah, that's what I said.\u000a Is growling a part of digesting it?\u000a No.\u000a It's the way your body reacts to the smell.\u000a If we use your logic, I'm not saying, remember, the way we work things in here is that you can't judge if it's right or wrong, you can certainly disagree with it, that's true. I may disagree, but this is your work, this is not for me to, this is what you're thinking. So, but, using the logic you used, growling, light-headed and dryness in mouth is not a part of digestion, but what do these things have in common? I saw someone, what do these things here have in common?\u000a They're symptoms of hunger.\u000a OK, so you're calling them symptoms of hunger? What else might they be?\u000a Indicators?\u000a Indicators? Is there another word?\u000a Signals.\u000a Signals.  If you have stomach growling, you feel light-headed, you have a dryness in your mouth, that's a signal, right? And where does the nose fit in to that? And I'll come back to you. You have an answer for my question with the nose? Or you have something else to add?\u000a Like the nose, the nose indicates that you're allowed to put food in your mouth and so you prepare with the saliva so you can help break it down.\u000a So the nose, so if you can't smell...\u000a It's like, when you have a cold, you can't really taste things.\u000a Okay, but does the saliva not flow? Because you can't smell? Because you said, you need to smell to be able to get the saliva to break it down. So if you can't smell, if you have a stuffy nose, or if you don't have a sense of smell, does that stop the saliva?\u000a No.\u000a No, she said, "I don't know." And that's an okay answer. She doesn't know. You could have an opinion.\u000a

V Stationary point.  Did he move? Okay, some of the other groups are moving their fingers around, sometimes they were releasing from up here and up here, so do you think your data might be a little more realistic?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah, okay so, now one thing, what type of formation do you guys have? \u000a Good. Put an adjective in front of it.\u000a Extremely strong.\u000a Strong. A strong positive. Do you think every correlation around here is gonna be the same?\u000a No.\u000a No.\u000a Okay, so yours is probably going to be one of the strongest ones. Remember that correlation coefficient?\u000a R, it went from positive one to negative one or zero?\u000a Oh yeah.\u000a What do you think yours would be close to?\u000a One.\u000a It'd be really close to-- Then we'll get to that shortly guys, later on. Okay?\u000a So you probably would have one that's a decimal 999 or really close.\u000a Okay, so you're trying to find your slope?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So what is your slope?\u000a Two.\u000a Two, okay, so over here we're gonna put-- And now, does everyone have the exact same?\u000a You do?\u000a Pretty much.\u000a Oh, most groups who are four people are slightly off depending on where you put the line. Okay, here's the slope. So you just told me your slope is two, now what am I asking you to do? What is your-- \u000a No, we're not done yet. What is your--\u000a It's 2.0.\u000a Read the question. \u000a Okay, what's the slope of the equation? The slope is-- What did you just tell me?\u000a Oh, two.\u000a Two.  Okay now, what's the real-world meaning of that? What does that mean when you say yes, those are two.\u000a Okay now, we can go back to that, I just want to talk to you about the solution. Just on your slope, you said it was two. That was perfect. But now, what's the real-world meaning?\u000a So the slope is the more rubber band...\u000a What are you looking at? \u000a So it's one and two...\u000a One. \u000a Why can't it?\u000a So you want to put five? Okay. Ten over. Okay, so now you're telling me your slope is, ten over one.  Okay, well I'm asking you what's your slope. Now you're saying your slope is 10. That's what the slope is but I want the real-world meaning. So what were you saying?\u000a For every one rubber band that drops...\u000a How do you know? How do you know-- But where are you getting... I need a little more detail though. It's dropping what? So, 10 centimeters for every?\u000a One.\u000a One rubber band. Okay. Now, what's your y-intercept?\u000a Seven.\u000a Seven. Now is your y-intercept directions to get somewhere else or is it telling the exact location? What's the y-intercept? Because a slope, isn't that directions to get somewhere else? What's the y-intercept? I want the entire-- It's zero seven. So can you write zero seven down please? Write zero seven down. And now, tell me what the real-- When I ask you what the y-intercept is, yes, zero seven. Now what's the real-world meaning.\u000a ...subtract out of seven...\u000a So what's this saying? Translate that for me. You're saying there's no real-world meaning, what's that saying? \u000a So, before we put any rubber bands on, this already moves seven centimeters. What does that mean? Going into this lab, did I know if the real-world meaning was gonna make sense or not. There's been a few groups today their y-intercept has a real-world meaning\u000a zero zero. But did I know where your line was gonna go? No. But if it went straight through zero would that make sense? Zero rubber band? So--\u000a So what's the real-world meaning?\u000a Well, what do you think? This y-intercept that you had, does it have a real-world meaning? No. So yeah, it doesn't have a real-world meaning. What slope did it? Okay. Once again, did I know that coming in? Depended on your data. Good job. \u000a Guys, you're asking If you plug into this, four times three, that's 12.\u000a But yeah. Three, two and four. I think it says three. Okay? So what's your equation...  Y equals 3x plus 12? Okay so let's talk about that.\u000a No, no it's one, intercept the y... \u000a It really doesn't play out with that algorithm.\u000a It makes no absolute sense whatsoever. \u000a Yeah but you find air.\u000a Oh that makes sense.\u000a But this...\u000a What are we talking about?\u000a We got one anyway, but really that's it.\u000a Wait one second, backtrack for one second. So, what did you say here?\u000a Five-thirds.\u000a What is a five-thirds?  5/3. Okay, so what's the real-world meaning?\u000a Every five inches there is three rubber band.\u000a Okay. So now does the ball go on a rubber band? So flip that around so you're saying two rubber bands, the figure is going--\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay, does that have real-world meaning? Does that have real-world meaning?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah. Okay, Now you're saying what, your y-intercept is-- can I see your graph paper for a second?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. So yeah, it looks like it's around-- Does everybody have the same?\u000a No.\u000a Do you think everyone's gonna get the exact same line?\u000a We didn't really have an intercept slope, we just looked at... \u000a We just...\u000a Yeah, which sounds great because you're all gonna draw that line slightly different, so go with one then.\u000a What does that y-intercept-- Is that directions or is that a location? It's a location, isn't it? So can you write the exact location? Because you're only counting one. What's the order of pairs here? You have a pair of zero one, so write that down.\u000a Pair of zero ones. You have a pair of zero ones.\u000a Yeah.\u000a What's zero represent?\u000a Zero rubber bands.\u000a Zero rubber bands. So when zero rubber bands were attached, how far did that--\u000a One.\u000a One inch. Does that make sense to you? So when there's zero rubber bands attached, you figure out one inch? Alright, let's demonstrate that. Let's see. Can I see that for one sec please? Okay, let's go back to before we started. Zero rubber bands attached, what's happening. Okay, what's happening right now. Zero rubber bands-- Did he already move one inch?\u000a No.\u000a So, Does the y-intercept come in?\u000a No.\u000a No.\u000a You said... \u000a Because you just told me it was five inches of three. Yeah. What are we discussing now? The data, or the equation for the... Okay? Now so, does this y-intercept make sense?\u000a No.\u000a Zero rubber bands are removed. So does the y-intercept have real-world meaning?\u000a No.\u000a Does the slope have real-world meaning?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Did I know your y-intercept wasn't gonna have real-world meaning?\u000a Yes.\u000a No, because there's some people today that actually have real-world meaning. What would be a y-intercept if it made sense?\u000a Zero zero.\u000a Zero zero. Zero rubber bands equals--\u000a Zero inches.\u000a Zero inches.\u000a What were you saying your slope was? So let's discuss three. The slope is three, what's the real-world meaning?\u000a How many rubber bands would you need in your description?\u000a Grabbing one rubber band, does that make sense? Okay, now, so now what anout your y-intercept would be at 12. Now you gotta figure... Let's discuss this right here.  Now, I think you're thinking ahead. But this line looks like it's crossing up here to-- Where is it crossing? It's crossing at-- We're going up three, look, three, six, seven. Yeah I was looking like around four. So let's discuss this. You have six? That could be perfect, but we know the exact way a line likes to go. Let's go with Monique, six. What's that saying? Let's go to a pair, to the y-intercept. Zero pair, zero six. So what does that mean? So write that down, zero pair, zero six for the y-intercept. And what's that actually mean?\u000a Zero rubber bands in front of the six equals how many inches.\u000a So, this was the figure. Zero rubber bands attached, does that make it already move six inches? Does that make any sense at all? So does the y-intercept have real-world meaning? Could it still have real-world meaning? You were thinking ahead I think, when you drew your line. Because what's the only y-intercept that makes sense here? Zero rubber bands--\u000a 81 inches.\u000a But you didn't move. But does that mean you can decide I want to make real-world meaning and just draw my line down the zero? Because what am I looking for? The equation for the line of-- Is yours the equation for the line now? Your y-intercept makes sense, If you knew the equation for the y-intercept.\u000a You plug in 81 inches for X right?\u000a Did you end up with a negative?  \u000a You're fine. You what? \u000a Minus what? Oh, minus one. I wanna discuss it. If you're y-intercept is... What's the order of pairs...? Zero, negative one, so what's the real-world meaning?   What's that mean? What's the zero represent?  Okay, so zero rubber bands, what's your y-interception? At zero rubber bands, how far does it go now?\u000a Negative one\u000a Did he already go one, or did he reach it? So does that make sense? Zero rubber bands and he's already traveled one? Does that make any sense? So does the y-intercept? Does that mean your y-intercept just didn't end up happening?\u000a Yeah.\u000a When you know how to use this it works,  With zero rubber bands, how fast are you going? Zero? Zero. Okay, does that mean your data's all wrong? No, that's the way your numbers work. Could you slope this out instead three? What's that mean? Three, three what? Four is still, Five is... So three... Three what? Let's go and do number five. Distance, so what would your distance be? Inches. So it's like three inches is over one-- So that makes sense. So, does your slope have real-world meaning?\u000a Yeah. Okay.\u000a

V We are now getting into Earth, Sun, and Moon interactions. We have done one thing, well, we have done several things, all year, on that first slide, which you copied onto your board. What is it?\u000a The moon phases.\u000a The moon phases. You do the moon phases every day. So, you should be pretty familiar with moon phases, what they are, how they happen, all that good stuff. We get to move on. Okay. Let\u2019s start with something you do know. What is a moon phase? Tom.\u000a It\u2019s what, well, it\u2019s technically, when you look up in the sky, and, like, what light you see in the moon.\u000a Good. What light you see in the moon. Where does the light come from? The green she\u2019s reflecting.\u000a The sun?\u000a The sun. How does that work?\u000a The sun shines on the moon and reflects back.\u000a Good, the sun shines on the moon and reflects back. So, that\u2019s how we see the moon. Do you agree with that? I see most of you agree. Good. Okay. Then, if we know that it comes from the sun, why don\u2019t you tell me some of the moon phases, so we can build on what you just told me. What are some of the moon phases? This one should be easy.\u000a Waxing crescent.\u000a Waxing crescent, excellent. Aisha?\u000a Waxing gibbous.\u000a Waxing gibbous, very good. Grillen?\u000a Waning crescent.\u000a Waning crescent. Bailey?\u000a Full moon.\u000a Full moon. Tom?\u000a Waning gibbous.\u000a Waning gibbous. Ramos?\u000a 1st quarter.\u000a 1st quarter, excellent.\u000a New moon.\u000a New moon, excellent.\u000a Last quarter.\u000a Last quarter.\u000a Third quarter.\u000a Third quarter and last quarter, very good. When we talked in the last class, some of you said, \u201cSecond quarter!\u201d Then, the second quarter is half time, so, that would be what moon phase?  What\u2019s halfway in between first and third?  What moon phase is that? \u000a Full moon?\u000a Yay, full moon, yay!  Yeah, just start spouting everything out, and then, eventually, you\u2019ll be right. That works for me. Yeah, it\u2019s a full moon. Get it, half, full? Or not, okay. So, we have all these moon phases. How can you tell which one\u2019s which? Why don\u2019t you just look up and say, \u201cYay, it\u2019s a fingernail!\u201d How do you tell which one\u2019s which?\u000a Because different moon phases look different.\u000a How does it look different?\u000a Because--\u000a It\u2019s okay.\u000a Because different parts of the moon have light on it, in different amounts.\u000a Okay, different parts of the moon have different amounts of light on it. How would I be able to tell a waxing something from a waning something?  You\u2019re almost, almost there. Yeah?  \u000a I think you will because the moon has different kinds of faces.\u000a Good, very good. Different kinds of faces.\u000a One lights up on the left side and the other lights up on the right side.\u000a Which one lights up on the right side?\u000a The waxing.\u000a How do you know that?\u000a Because, um... Well, you always told us it\u2019s light on the right, it\u2019s wax-iting.\u000a Yeah, it\u2019s light on the right, it\u2019s wax-iting! Or, what you guys like to do...\u000a Wax on, wane off.\u000a Or, wane off. I don\u2019t know, wax on. Okay? So, I don\u2019t have a problem, I don\u2019t think that you have a problem knowing the different phases of the moon. I think you guys are pretty set on that. How about what causes the phases of the moon? What makes that happen? You\u2019ve already told me light reflecting off the moon that comes from the sun, but, why would you have parts? Why wouldn\u2019t you just be able to see the whole thing, all the time? Sean.\u000a Because the earth blocks out some of the light that\u2019s coming from the moon.\u000a Okay, good. Brenda?\u000a Because the earth rotates with time, and when the earth rotates, the earth blocks the sun, so you can see, maybe, at the top of the moon.\u000a Okay, good. Tom?\u000a There are other stars shining in different directions, not just the sun.\u000a Okay, very good. Stars shining at different directions. Anything else? Nancy.\u000a Because the moon is moving, and so \u000a Okay, as the moon moves, we see different phases. So, I hear a lot of that the earth blocks the moon, the sun from reaching the moon. Are you in agreeance?\u000a Yeah.\u000a A little bit.\u000a Yeah, yeah, somewhat? Okay. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do. You have won the experiment. You\u2019ve done the flip camera. But, what I want you to do, on your table, everybody has, like a big lollipop. You either have the blue styrofoam ball, you have the big, white styrofoam ball, you have a little styrofoam ball. I want you, each person in your group to have one of those styrofoam balls. Okay? And then, you are going to come this way--\u000a Down in your light paths?\u000a You are gonna come up front, and gather around my lovely light bulb. Okay? Come forth, children.  And you might wanna squat down, if you\u2019re near the front. Yay! I know it\u2019s bright. Good?\u000a Can\u2019t see.\u000a Oh, you can\u2019t see, okay, alright. Oh,  Okay, what I want you to do, and you\u2019re already doing it, hold it out in front of you, I want you to look at your moon. What am I holding in my left hand?\u000a The sun.\u000a The light bulb, the sun. You have the moon, yay. Here, hold it out in front of you. What moon phase do you have on your moon? Aisha?\u000a New moon.\u000a New moon. Why is it a new moon?\u000a Because you can\u2019t see any light.\u000a You can\u2019t see any light. I can see lots of light. It\u2019s blinding me. Oh, there we go. But, there\u2019s a light source. Isn\u2019t my moon illuminated? Becky?\u000a It\u2019s illuminated on one side, but since you\u2019re behind it, you don\u2019t see any of the light coming--\u000a Well, then, how do I know it\u2019s illuminated?\u000a Because you can see other light?\u000a Oh! So, I look across from me, and I see Sean. Sean, you have a full moon.  Now, you\u2019re supposed to disagree with me, and tell me that no, you don\u2019t.\u000a Oh, okay. Um...\u000a What moon do you have?\u000a A new moon.\u000a No, you don\u2019t, you have a full moon. \u000a He has a waxing moon.\u000a No, he doesn\u2019t, he has a full moon.  You all are crazy. Look.  It\u2019s illuminated on the other side.  Okay. Oh, yeah, you could do that. But then, wouldn\u2019t your head be in line with the earth?  It doesn\u2019t make any sense.  But, that is one way that we can figure out that the moon is illuminated. Not that we have 15 different moons, or 28, or however many people we have. But, just because we\u2019re looking at a new moon, doesn\u2019t mean that the moon\u2019s not illuminated, it\u2019s just the other side. So, I look across, and I can see full moon across from me. What else can you see, from where you\u2019re standing? Tell me what you see and where you see it. Yes.\u000a Over there, with Zack and Sarah, I see fullmoon.\u000a Okay, good.\u000a Over there, I see a waning gibbous.\u000a Really? I see a waxing gibbous. Uh, Becky.\u000a I see a full moon, over at Zack.\u000a Nice.\u000a I see a waxing gibbous with Charlese.\u000a I see a full moon.\u000a Well, I see a waxing gibbous.\u000a Why? Why do you see a waxing gibbous, and I see a full moon?\u000a Because we\u2019re in different places.\u000a What\u2019s that got to do with anything?  I thought y'all told me that we saw moon phases because the Earth's shadow blocks the sunlight from reaching the moon. How can we see moon phases then? Tiffany? Ooo... Kaitlyn?\u000a Line of sight.\u000a Line of sight? What does that mean?\u000a Um...\u000a Besides, your sight in a line. \u000a It's, um, well... Because sunlight's here, it looks like a new moon, but if the sunlight were, like over there, it wouldn't.\u000a Huh? Interesting. Brooke.\u000a Well, I'm just suspecting that Lauren turns kind of the moon out of view then, like I couldn't see a shadow I could only see the new moon.\u000a Oh, because, oh, well, oh Lauren's head is in the way. \u000a Look at if the Earth was in the way that.\u000a If the Earth was in the way, would that cause a moon phase?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Is the Earth in the way of the moon all the time?\u000a No.\u000a What could we call... Sorry.  What do we call it when we have the Earth and the moon and the sun lined up, or if the moon is blocking light from getting to the Earth, or if the Earth is blocking light from getting to the moon?  Bailey?\u000a An eclipse.\u000a An eclipse. Have we talked about an eclipse before?  A little bit. Just a little bit. So, is there anything in between me, well, is there anything between the moon and the sun? In my...\u000a No.\u000a No. vicinty, because if I ask you, you're gonna be like, "Yeah, Lauren's head is in the way."  "She's blocking all the light."  There's nothing in between me and the light source, yet all around you're saying you see different moon phases. Correct?\u000a Mmm hmm.\u000a Mmm hmm. I want you to think about that. Why you can see different phases on my styrofoam ball, but there's nothing in between us.\u000a Because the moon and the earth is at a different angle.\u000a Ooh. 'Cause the earth is at a different angle.\u000a Because of our position?\u000a Your positions. Very interesting. Here's what I'm willing to have you do. You all have a light bulb, some work, some don't I know there was at least one group in the last class that blew a light bulb.  So, you might have to share, but I'm gonna have you go back to your seats. Some of you have three people. Some of you have four people. Some of you have two. Daniel, you have three now. I want you to set yourselves up in an arrangement around your light bulb, where you personally can see four different moon phases, or three different moon phases, depending on how many people are in your group. So, you need to be able to see, if there are four of you, four different moon phases. You stand there. You hold it, and if you get it, raise your hand for me now.  Okay, that was your challenge. You don't have to fill anything. You don't have to do anything. Off you go. \u000a Try not to blow it.\u000a Alright, move Michael.\u000a Where do you think it's gonna be?\u000a Put it like this. Okay.\u000a It doesn't have a switch. It's just automatically on and off.\u000a Yay, we made it.\u000a Nice. \u000a Are we getting there?\u000a Okay.\u000a Okay, since you have four people, you're going to position yourselves differently than they are. They only have three. So, you're gonna think, think about a clock. Where on the clock will you put everybody, so you can all see four different moon phases, from your angle.\u000a Well, one can go at twelve.\u000a Twelve, twelve, six, and nine and three.\u000a Like a cross.\u000a Do it.\u000a I don't think we can put anybody over there.\u000a And then, tell me when you get it.\u000a We can't put anybody over there. So, that'll be like twelve, this'll be like...\u000a Well, we need a camera for it.\u000a Right there, we're not using a camera.\u000a Okay.\u000a Well, now...\u000a So Brenda can stand there, Brooke can..\u000a Or, we can do, like, um, like, this kinda way. I'll be here. she'll be there, and she'll be there, and you'll be at the corner.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay.  So, take your moon.\u000a It won't move until you stand there and hold it.\u000a No, I see yours. New moon.   \u000a No, it looks like a waxing.\u000a Excellent, ladies and gentlemen, I have a group who has it. Ooo, it looks like I have another group who has it. Ooo I have another group who has it. Somebody tell me, If you equate it to a clock, where are you standing? Tell me what numbers you're standing on, Jamie.\u000a Uh, oh...\u000a Oh. Forget about that?  For one moment, we had it.\u000a She's on number one. She's sitting at four.\u000a On a clock.\u000a She's nine. She's three, and six and twelve.\u000a Good. So, one of the ways you can do it is, twelve, three, six, nine. You can do it that way. Or, you could actually scoot yourselves a little differently, you could rearrange yourselves and see something besides... What are you moon phases that you have?\u000a Um, that's waxing gibbous\u000a Waxing gibbous There's full moon, new moon, and this looks like...\u000a I see full. I see new, and then if you're at nine and three, I should only be able to see  half. What would those things be?\u000a Mmm...\u000a Go ahead.\u000a First and third quarter.\u000a Good, first and third quarter. I want you guys to see if you can figure out different arrangements to make it--\u000a Okay.\u000a Something besides those four. And, you got it too.\u000a Okay, we could...\u000a Get a...\u000a And then someone could be... Could be right there, and right there. \u000a Yeah. \u000a I see a full moon, I see a full moon.\u000a I just see a full moon. Because your the light source.\u000a I see a full moon, and a...\u000a I see a full moon.\u000a I just see a full moon.\u000a Do you see a half moon here?\u000a I see a full moon.\u000a Well... \u000a Now, do you wanna switch out?\u000a Okay, I'll take it.\u000a Okay, it's blinding.\u000a Ooo, yay. Oh, yeah. I see a new moon, and I like see a...\u000a Everybody got it at least once. \u000a Yep.\u000a Yep. Okay, do me a favor, unplug your light bulb, and come back to your group. \u000a Okay. Was there anything in between you, well, actually, your moon and your sun? \u000a No.\u000a No. So, does your theory or your hypothesis that the Earth blocks the light from reaching the moon still work?\u000a No.\u000a Carolyn says no. Tom.\u000a Technically it can work, because when you have a, I forgot what kinda eclipse it's called, but it's an eclipse of the moon it goes, like, all red or something, we had it this year, and the Arth, Earth, arth... The Earth is blocking it in a way worse.\u000a Okay, so is that going to change the phase of the moon, nightly? Becky.\u000a No.\u000a She says no. Do you agree? So what changes the phase of the moon? Ben?\u000a The way we see it from Earth.\u000a The way we see it from Earth. Agree?\u000a Yes.\u000a Ah, interesting. Now, when you did the experiment before, when you did it with a flip camera, we're gonna re-watch some of those videos. I'm just gonna do the montage, so it's not necessarily gonna be your entire class, but we're gonna go through, and you need to critique each one. You need to figure out do they do something wrong? Do they do something correct? Do you need to do something with that? Do you need to re-think your flip camera video? Because, we're gonna do it again after we get finished with this. Make sense? Are you sure?\u000a Mmm hmm.\u000a Are you positive?\u000a Mmm hmm.\u000a Let's watch the first one.  Okay. Let me play it for you again. See the phases?\u000a Yeah. \u000a Alright, now. I want you to tell me. Besides being blinded. What did they do correct? What was right?\u000a They were in a orbit not around the sun, just a orbit.\u000a Excellent, they were not orbiting around the sun, a.k.a. the lightbulb. What did they do incorrect?\u000a They didn't call out the phases.\u000a Okay, they didn't call out the phases.\u000a They didn't orbit, orbit the camera.\u000a They did. The camera was in the middle. So, it went around. So, that's okay. Think about that. They went around. There's even something wrong...\u000a

V  How you guys doing?\u000a So .3.\u000a Oh, what did you do by touching those?\u000a It made a short circuit.\u000a It crossed.\u000a Wow, the orange is a lot less than the kiwi and the apple.\u000a Yeah.\u000a It's only .3.\u000a Why do you think that is?\u000a .03.\u000a Maybe because...\u000a It's like different rods or something.\u000a Oranges are more sour than the other fruit. Not, and like have more acid or something. Because it stops the energy.\u000a We want it a half centimeter apart right?\u000a Yeah. Two centimeters. Around.\u000a So okay, go ahead. Make sure they aren't touching.\u000a 0.1.\u000a It's not even measuring at all. Oh, 0.1. 0.01.\u000a Oh .01.\u000a That's crazy.\u000a I know. How this supposed to be one, the other two were so high?\u000a 0.98.\u000a I never thought fruits and vegetables could have so much energy. Except for oranges. I thought this would have as much as the apple.\u000a My hypothesis, I actually thought that the orange would have the most.\u000a Go ahead. Alright, Lizzy you can do the voltage reader. Stick them in a half centimeter apart. And a centimeter in. Okay, Lizzy make sure they don't touch.\u000a Don't short circuit them.\u000a It's like completely zero. \u000a The bigger it is, the more volts it has.\u000a The middle one, it left like a little here and this was the most.\u000a I think it's more concentrating volts in the middle more than anywhere else.\u000a Hmm, I wonder why that would be.\u000a Okay, so now we have to get a calculator. Okay, so 0.22. Plus 0.09.\u000a Plus 0.28.\u000a I got 0.1966667.\u000a So what are you gonna do with that number?\u000a Round it up.\u000a Okay. 0.20. But wait, doesn't someone else need to try it?\u000a Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good idea. 0.22, plus--\u000a 0., oh never mind.\u000a Divided by three. I got the same answer.\u000a So what was the answer to the investigative question? What do you think?\u000a The...\u000a The apple, had the most.\u000a Do you agree with that?\u000a Yes.\u000a Why do you think that is? Do you have any guesses?\u000a It's...\u000a It's bigger. It could carry more volts.\u000a It has, yeah--\u000a It has like more juice.\u000a Yeah, that's true.\u000a I think the juice.\u000a Was your hypothesis correct?\u000a Actually, it was. Like right here, well. Well, actually I said the potatoes will have the most voltage because like usually they, potatoes for like cloth and other things to energize with, but I guess apples would work better.\u000a What was yours?\u000a I thought the, I thought the carrots would produce more because you know, usually when you like eat one it's like very wet, wet when you just get them, so I thought the carrot was going to win, but guess not.\u000a I thought it was the apple. I already said that.\u000a My hypothesis, I thought, I think the potato would have the most because I heard like, I've heard that potatoes could produce a lot of energy, and last year when when they were doing a science experiment they said that they had potatoes for like volts. So I suspected that they may have been, have a lot of voltage also.\u000a Okay.\u000a To our investigative question, our question was which fruit will produce the most energy?\u000a And the...\u000a Kiwi.\u000a Kiwi and apple had tied for it.\u000a 0.98.\u000a So I don't know, maybe like some other time we should do another experiment and see if we get the same results.\u000a I wonder why the orange was so low though.\u000a Maybe because we, since we put it too deep or something.\u000a No, we did the same thing, we put all of them.\u000a Yeah, I know.\u000a Well.\u000a So then our, so our answer was that the kiwi and the apple both had the highest.\u000a So how about your hypothesis?\u000a I thought orange would have it. I thought orange would have it.\u000a I thought orange had it too.\u000a And had the highest.\u000a Why?\u000a Because it had like...\u000a I thought the apple would because we didn't, I thought the apple was because of how much bigger it was.\u000a How about you Kirsten what did you think?\u000a I thought the orange because it has more citrus in it, I mean yeah.\u000a I would have thought kiwi would have less because it's so small.\u000a Yeah, me too.\u000a That's what I thought.\u000a Then what was our evidence?\u000a Apple had for an average, had 0.98. Orange had 0.16. And then kiwi had 0.06. 0.16. And then kiwi had 0.98. So kiwi and apple tied.\u000a And then our evidence is our data table because that's where we recorded everything.\u000a Yep.\u000a So then how can you be sure that you conducted a fair investigation?\u000a We did them the same length apart and...\u000a So what are you guys trying to figure out over here?\u000a We're, we're trying to figure out what if the apple, carrot or potato has enough voltage to light the food battery.\u000a What is the food representing in this case?\u000a A battery.\u000a Okay.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, how you gonna figure that out? What is your plan?\u000a We are gonna do, gonna try to do a voltage reader and put, try to see how much voltage there is in an apple, potato or a carrot.\u000a I think we should use the apple because in our investigation it had the most voltage, well like the apple, but should we do a parallel battery or the something that starts with an S battery?\u000a Series.\u000a Series, let's do series.\u000a Let's try series.\u000a It lights up more.\u000a Yeah, it's brighter.\u000a Okay, let's get it done. Oh wait, we're gonna need more.\u000a There's a wire in here.\u000a So I think that the apple will like light up the battery brighter. Or at all because it has, I think it's gonna have the most, it has the most voltage and so it'll make it become brighter.\u000a Which do you?\u000a Oh wait, we're doing a series battery so...\u000a Maybe we--\u000a Where's the other apple?\u000a It's over there, Reece has it.\u000a Need to wrap it around tight.\u000a Can I check?\u000a Jayden, do you wanna do it?\u000a Sure. I'll have the honors.\u000a Keep this one untouched because I'm gonna wrap this wire against that because it needs to, this negative. Just the white one.\u000a Okay, there is no wire in this.\u000a Okay, so--\u000a I think we have enough wires here.\u000a What do you need the wires for?\u000a To wrap around, to make a series.\u000a To allow the energy to flow through.\u000a Okay, so what's the purpose of the wires?\u000a So that the energy will be able to flow.\u000a What is the energy that's going through the wires?\u000a Electricity.\u000a But okay, so what is the function of the wires?\u000a To like be able to pass from one spot to like, the battery to the light.\u000a Okay, so you have two different wires. Why is that?\u000a To be able to...\u000a You know, why you have two different wires?\u000a Um, no.\u000a No. I'm gonna give you a minute to think about it.\u000a Okay.\u000a Is it working?\u000a No, not yet. Well, I don't think it's working.\u000a I think I didn't--\u000a Oh, it's going.\u000a No, I don't think I  wrapped the wire around right.\u000a Oh, yeah, because the--\u000a This is really short.\u000a So yeah, it was tucking it.\u000a Let's see that and that and that. Yeah, that thing's wrapped up tight.\u000a Well, if the volts are enough.\u000a Don't the apples have to be touching?\u000a No, they don't have to be touching. They just have to be, the wires just have to go from positive to negative.\u000a Yeah.\u000a True.\u000a But if they don't have enough voltage, we should use a potato.\u000a Yeah, we can put the potato to help.\u000a Yeah, we need to put them in every fruit. And then connect the wires like that to that, that to that.\u000a So, make sure they don't touch.\u000a Yeah, so kinda wrap it around with the wire. Yeah, try to wrap it around as tight as you can so that...\u000a Do you, what do you guys think, do you think that fruit could power our school?\u000a I don't think so.\u000a It might power a small light bulb like the ones that we use in here, but--\u000a You don't think there's enough voltage to supply our whole school?\u000a No.\u000a Well, like maybe if we put like a bunch of fruit on the roof or something. I don't know how that would turn out, but maybe if we put a whole bunch and like stacked it on top.\u000a Would you think that would be economical? You think that would be beneficial to us in any way?\u000a Maybe.\u000a Why?\u000a It could, but we'd have to keep changing out the fruit, and changing out the fruit.\u000a It'd be lots more work that's for sure. Don't let them touch.\u000a That connects to that and that.\u000a Do we have another one? Because this one is broken.\u000a Can we borrow one from over here?\u000a Oh, we have one. There you go.\u000a What do you think is gonna happen?\u000a I think it'll like, because we have none of the same touching.\u000a First we should check the voltage.\u000a Well I don't, we'll just see if it lights the light.\u000a No, don't connect those.\u000a Why would you wanna check the voltage?\u000a Just to see if it has enough potential of battery.\u000a Would make more electricity. All the averages.\u000a I think it should be good this way.\u000a Because we tested a battery and saw how much it was.\u000a Connect one to it. Then connect yours Lizzy.\u000a Maybe, did we do it wrong?\u000a No, I don't think so.\u000a Well, I think that maybe it loses potential inside the fruit?\u000a Maybe it--\u000a Try an separate those a little more Kirsten.\u000a Maybe they're both plus and plus.\u000a Maybe it's because we're using three types of fruit. If we use just two. What if we took the prongs out and replace that with this?\u000a Okay, try that.\u000a Put it in a different hole this time because we just changed it.\u000a Well, don't--\u000a What are we trying to do here?\u000a We were trying to make all these the same one.\u000a Why would you do that?\u000a Maybe because they need to be the same? From the, both positive and negative.\u000a Oh.\u000a And we need to make sure so those could be the plus and minus, doesn't matter which way. And that and that needs to touch, and then that one and that one, which is exactly what we did. But wait--\u000a

V They died because?\u000a No CO2.\u000a Two snails.\u000a So if add another plant in there is that going to add CO2, or is it going to take away more CO2?\u000a Takeaway, you could probably try it with the lights off.\u000a Why do you think that would work?\u000a Umm... Maybe it might give them some more CO2.\u000a Okay, well why don't you write down your predictions, so she said turn the lights off and see what happens. So did your snail coordinate with your prediction?\u000a Yeah, but for long.\u000a Not for long? All right, Haley, so look at your prediction. This is your setup. Isaiah, can you go shut the door for me?\u000a Okay, so number E.\u000a Stay alive, stay alive.\u000a Not number, letter E.\u000a It lived.\u000a Okay, why do you think\u000a But is also in\u000a unstable environment.\u000a I thought plants needed sunlight to live. How are they still alive, and then they died when when you --\u000a Because there was no light? \u000a It was light.\u000a Tell me what\u000a you said.\u000a I had no idea.\u000a Wait, never mind.\u000a What do you think?\u000a It's a miracle.\u000a It's a miracle? Why don't you go back to your prior knoweldge here. What did we say... You didn't answer some of those, but what do you think... Obviously something is making CO2, right? 'Cause that started at six, right? If we hit carbon reset, look. It starts at six and six, we're even. If I hit play, look what's happening. What's happening to the CO2 level?\u000a It's getting bigger.\u000a Yeah, why is it getting bigger? Where's that CO2 coming from? Who's making it?\u000a The plants. \u000a Okay, why are they making it?\u000a So they can live.\u000a Okay, what's that called? Like what process is that when they make CO2?\u000a Photosynthesis.\u000a Photosynthesis makes CO2?\u000a I guess.\u000a No.\u000a Isn't it cellular res-per-tation? Ms. Rutala, isn't it that?\u000a Respiration. You know how we talked about this? This is photosynthesis, right? Carbon dioxide plus water in the sun is going to make glucose and oxygen, right? For respiration, they're taking that exact same glucose and that oxygen, and they're making three things. They're going to make energy to stay alive. That's why those plants are still living. They're going to make...\u000a CO2.\u000a Which is why...\u000a They're still living.\u000a Uh huh.  And why there's a high number in there, and they're also going to make...\u000a H2O, which is water.\u000a Does that make sense? Do you see now why those numbers are going up for CO2?\u000a Yeah.\u000a 'Cause they're going through...\u000a Photosynthesis.\u000a No.\u000a 'Cause their going through the energy.\u000a CO2.\u000a Respiration. Respiration is the process. Do you see that?\u000a Yeah.\u000a All right, you're welcome. All right, how are we doing here?\u000a Good.\u000a You guys are still ready to predict the second part? Okay, how are we doing here?\u000a We just now got to the back.\u000a That's okay, you take your time. This is good. Take your time as long as you are understanding. That's the whole point of this. Okay, so move on to this one. What is a new question you have or an experiment you would want to do?\u000a The snail one.\u000a Well, what's the snail one? What's a question you have based on what you just did? Are you curious about something? What's a new question or a new experiment you'd want to try?\u000a How come, well, I just want to know why the snail keeps dying.\u000a Okay, you can put that down. Why does the snail keep dying? Did it die in every single situaiton though?\u000a No.\u000a Everyone we've done so far.\u000a You might want to think about why, which situations it died in, right? All right, let's see. Put your head up. All right, you guys are still in this one? Test tube C2 has plants and snails, but resulted in an unstable environment, why? I thought plants and snails helped each other live. Why did they die?\u000a Because they didn't have that much, what's it called, oxygen.\u000a Well, when they started the test tube it was at six and six. All of them start at six, six, right? So look at test tube C2. To plants, two snails. The lights are...\u000a Off.\u000a The O2 level at the end of the experiment is?\u000a 12, oh, oh.\u000a It's at what?\u000a Zero point --\u000a Zero point zero, which means there is no oxygen, so does that make sense as to why one of these died?\u000a The snail was the one. The snails died.\u000a Uh huh, and then the CO2 level is at?\u000a 12.\u000a 12, did the plants die?\u000a No.\u000a Why didn't they die but the snails died?\u000a Because the snails gave off their CO2?\u000a Um hmm And why did that keep the plants alive?\u000a Because they take in CO2?\u000a Uh huh, okay.\u000a But it somehow they didn't give off O2, I guess?\u000a Why is that somehow? Why weren't they able to give off O2?\u000a Because the lights weren't on?\u000a Uh huh, and why are the lights so important?\u000a To produce photosynthesis?\u000a Yes, they need light for photosynthesis. Remember, this is like a recipe, right? You have to have all three ingredients to make photosynthesis work. You have to have carbon dioxide, you have to have water, and you have to have sunlight. You can't just have one of the three. You can't have two of the three. You have to have all three. Do you see why that works? Okay, good.\u000a Um hmm.\u000a Okay, good. All right, how are we doing here?\u000a We're passing. Let me ask you --\u000a Yeah? I did not --\u000a She was in the bathroom.\u000a I went to go blow my nose.\u000a All right, let's go ahead and work over here. So let's go ahead and catchup ourselves here. What is one new question you have or experiment you would preform? So based on what you've already done is there something you are curious about? I just gave you free reign. Go ahead, do whatever you want. Do you have any questions about anything?\u000a Yeah, E.\u000a Stay here.\u000a Yeah, I'll stay here while you write it down.\u000a Why do they have to close it up? Close the test tubes up?\u000a Okay, so would you be curious about doing the experiment without closing it? That's a good question. What was your question?\u000a Every four plants and four snails. Would they survive with the lights on or off?\u000a What do you think?\u000a I think with the lights off because if they have four plants, they will have, I mean, if they had it on, they'll produce a lot of oxygen, therefore, the snails would die, but if you put it off, maybe they'll produce the right amount of oxygen.\u000a They'll produce a lot of oxygen, the snails will die?\u000a Well, it's kind of complicated.\u000a No, I want to try it out. You're saying that you think that --\u000a Because it's too much oxygen.\u000a Too much oxygen?\u000a In this one container, maybe?\u000a Well, who would benefit from all that oxygen?\u000a The snails.\u000a Okay.  So we know the snails would stay alive 'cause they would have what?\u000a Oxygen.\u000a Okay, what about the plants? Do you think the plants are going to stay alive?\u000a Nope.\u000a Why?\u000a Because they don't have carbon dioxide, maybe. \u000a How's the situation so far?\u000a Good.\u000a I think it's bad.\u000a Probably it won't survive because --\u000a So, in the light it's okay. It's balanced. One's giving, the other one's getting. You got that, all right? So what do you think is going to happen at night?\u000a They're going to die, probably.\u000a Who's going to die?\u000a The snails.\u000a Why do you think the snails are going to die?\u000a I don't know.\u000a Because it's going to be too much CO2.\u000a Too much CO2? Why is there going to be too much CO2?\u000a Because the snails can't get O2 'cause there's no light.\u000a Exactly. Go ahead and hit play.\u000a Whoa, whoa.  Too much CO2.\u000a Did that CO2, what did you notice about it?\u000a And the plants died.\u000a There was no oxygen.\u000a There was no oxygen, but why did the plants die? Plants don't need oxygen. Plants need CO2.\u000a There was too much?\u000a They couldn't give off --\u000a It already was at the max?\u000a Reached it's max. Here's my question. Are the snails the only ones making CO2? Who else is making CO2?\u000a The plants?\u000a Do plants make CO2 at night? How could you design a little experiment to test that? What can you do to design an experiment right now to test that?\u000a Take all the snails out.\u000a Okay, and what? \u000a Okay, let's see. We want to see if plants will go through respiration at night. \u000a We're looking for the CO2 only?\u000a What is that?\u000a A rock.  Okay, so look at your data so far. What do you notice?\u000a They're producing a lot of oxygen.\u000a I'm following.\u000a Okay, so isn't that weird? I thought plants made oxygen.\u000a I mean, they're producing a lot of carbon dioxide.\u000a They are? Why are they producing carbon dioxide? I thought plants made oxygen.\u000a Wasn't it through respiration?\u000a Okay, so they can't get sunlight, so they're not going through...\u000a Photosynthesis.\u000a Photosynthesis, but they are going through...\u000a Respiration.\u000a Respiration, so remember, our respiration, right? They don't have sunlight. Does respiration need sunlight to work?\u000a No, it needs energy.\u000a Nope, it doesn't. So all they need is what?\u000a CO2.\u000a No, what does this stand for?\u000a Glucose.\u000a Right, so they need glucose and?\u000a Oxygen.\u000a Was there oxygen in there before we started.\u000a No.\u000a There wasn't?\u000a Oh, wait, yes.\u000a There was, look.\u000a It's even.\u000a There was oxygen in there. There was six cpms of oxygen, so then it went through this process, and it made energy, which kept them alive, it made CO2, which you saw because the CO2 levels went...\u000a Up.\u000a Up.\u000a And it also made...\u000a Water.\u000a H2O.\u000a Which you can't really tell.\u000a It turned yellow.\u000a And it's probably still inside the cells. Does that make sense though? Okay, good. All right, how are we doing here?  Are we almost done, you guys? Are you getting, you're understanding?\u000a A little.\u000a Okay, well, let me ask you something. Do plants go through respiration?\u000a Uh, yes.\u000a How do you know?\u000a 'Cause they're color. It change colors.\u000a The plants change colors?\u000a No, the water.\u000a To what color?\u000a Dark blue.\u000a A dark blue?\u000a Like a darker blue.\u000a What does dark blue represent? Let's go back to the beginning part. What does dark blue tell you? Dark blue means that there's what? Low, dark blue means that there's low what? \u000a Okay, and you're telling me that respiration, sorry, that respiration. Plants go through respiration, right?\u000a Uh huh.\u000a So would there be a low amount of CO2, if it goes through respiration?\u000a No, no. It will be...\u000a Uh huh, so should it be blue?\u000a Yes, no, no, no, no. It'd be yellow.\u000a Uh huh, what kind of experiment did you do to show me that plants go through respiration? Tia, plants go through respiration.\u000a If you cut the lights on and cut the lights off, and if you cut the lights on, then the water turns blue because it's giving off oxygen. Cut the lights off, they won't go through respiration because they --\u000a They won't go through respiration?\u000a No, only photosynthesis because there will be no light for them.\u000a Stop, give me my paper.\u000a Okay, Tamara and Kelly O., please stop.\u000a And I have a question. Do you want us to do for our predictions, do you want us to do why or why not for both of them or just one?\u000a Even if they're different. Maybe one of your predictions your plants lived, maybe one of your predictions the plants die.\u000a Both of them lived\u000a Then you can just, why do you think both of them lived? All right, I have a quick question. Can you guys look over here for a second?  Okay, Tya, over here. William, over here. Okay, how may of you guys, I want a couple people to share their predictions. What helped your, when you had the three plants that died, right? Most of you were surprised. You were like, "Wow, how did three plants die "with the lights on? "They had oxygen, they had a CO2, "and they died." Right, so you were surprised. What was your prediction? What did you set up as an experiment to help them survive? What did you predict? Nacora, give me one.\u000a I put three plants and one snail.\u000a Okay, so she said she put three plants, one snail. How many of you guys did three plants and one snail? Or a combination of plants and snails? Okay, why did you do that? Why did you do a combination of plants and snails, William?\u000a Because the snails will produce the CO2 while the plants would produce the O2.\u000a Okay, so he said the plants would produce O2, the snails would produce CO2. What's another option? What if I said, "You know what? "I'm gonna take all your snails."  Good luck keeping those plants alive, Keyon. If I take away all your snails, and I said, "Haha, "you have no snails to keep your plants alive." Should that be a problem.\u000a No.\u000a Okay, tell me why that wouldn't be a problem. Why would that not be a problem, Haley?\u000a Because all you have to do is put three plants in the dark.\u000a Okay, how is that going to help you? How is putting three plants in the dark? She said, "You can just turn off the lights." How would that be helpful?\u000a Because there's more CO2.\u000a Okay, more CO2. Why is there more CO2?\u000a I would say you can just put them in the light and the dark 'cause when they're in the light they do photosynthesis, and when they're in the dark, they do respiration.\u000a Okay, she said, "In the dark they use photosynthesis, "and in the dark they do respiration." Isaiah?\u000a Wouldn't you just turn the lights off?\u000a Okay, we just said we could turn the lights completely off. Here's another question. Do plants go through respiration?\u000a Yes.\u000a No. Okay, hold on. If you said no, why are you saying no they don't go through respiration.\u000a Because only animals go through respiration, and plants go through photosynthesis.\u000a Okay, Brandon, I want you to set up an experiment for me. Put one plant. Put one plant in your test tube and turn the lights off. Just one plant in the test tube and turn the lights off. How many people know what's going to happen? One plant in a test tube with the lights off? All right.\u000a Look at that.\u000a Okay, are the plants alive?\u000a Yes.\u000a Is there more oxygen then CO2?\u000a No.\u000a What is there more of?\u000a CO2.\u000a How is there more CO2 in there? It started at six and six. Why is there more CO2 in there?\u000a Respiration.\u000a Because it's not doing photosynthesis.\u000a Because it's not going through photosynthesis, but that means that our O2 shouldn't go up. Why is the CO2 going up? Why is the CO2 going up?\u000a Because in the dark the plants breath out CO2.\u000a Okay what is that process of them breathing out, their getting rid of CO2? What is that process? Kaleil, you kept saying it over and over.\u000a Respiration.\u000a All right, respiration. Here's another question. Do plants go through respiration in the day time?\u000a No.\u000a Photosynthesis.\u000a What does respiration give you as an animal? \u000a ATP, wait. ATP and... I don't want to look, no. And oxygen, no. Carbon dioxide.\u000a So, respiration gives your carbon dioxide. If you look up here, look. Elise, respiration gives you carbon dioxide, water, and energy, right? Do plants, when they're going through photosynthesis, do they make energy? Do you see energy in the photosynthesis equation?\u000a No.\u000a Okay, so how do they stay alive during the day? Do they die during the day and stay alive at night.\u000a No.\u000a Do they stay alive during the day and die at night?\u000a No.\u000a How do they stay alive the whole day long?\u000a They use the sun's energy.\u000a They use the what?\u000a The sun's energy.\u000a Okay, and then what do they do with that glucose? It just sits there 'cause glucose isn't energy yet.\u000a They have to turn into respoiration\u000a Oh, so do they go through respiration during the day?\u000a Yes.\u000a No. They have to or they would die. So they make their energy. They make glucose, but the glucose isn't energy, Isaiah, until they break it down in respiration, so do plants have to go through respiration during the day and night?\u000a Yes.\u000a Yes, do you go through respiration day and night.\u000a Yes.\u000a No. You don't?\u000a No. Do you die at night every time you go to sleep?\u000a That would be creepy.\u000a You reproduce every time you go at night?\u000a No, what?\u000a No, you stay alive all day long.  You stay alive all day long, Tamara. Plants stay alive all day long because they go through respiration. This is the key. Respiration. The key, Nikera, to getting the glucose for respiration is in...\u000a Photosynthesis.\u000a Photosynthesis. This is what keeps everything alive, but to get some of the ingredients for this, you need to go through this. Do you see why now we depend on each other? Ah, yes. Okay, understanding.\u000a So, we don't go through photosynthesis, just plants do, but plants go through both.\u000a

V About 33.\u000a 33, so 150 plus 33?\u000a 180.\u000a What'd you get?\u000a 180.\u000a 180, so is that... Did we double?\u000a Went a little higher.\u000a Went a little higher. So you guys made a good prediction, didn't you? All right, keep doing your trials, nice work. Heads up, Madison. Heads up. Ah!\u000a Can you stop it?\u000a No, you're good. All right, so what have you guys found out so far?\u000a We've been increasing, but then we just... It increased a little, but I think we're gonna increase a little more.\u000a Okay, so you're measuring... You've all, you've raised your ramp to 10?\u000a Yes.\u000a All right. \u000a All right. Now, what was your prediction? It would go farther based on height?\u000a Because, like, from all the other experiments that we've done...\u000a Uh-huh.\u000a It's gone farther, so... And it has more force if the ramp is higher.\u000a Okay. Man, that ambulance, that thing moves. All right, what did you guys get, Mary Robin, when you measured?\u000a We got 179.\u000a 179, okay.\u000a What was weird is that... Like, what's weird is that on the first trial, we got 130, and then we went to, like, the, like 50s and things.\u000a Okay.\u000a And then we went back to like the 80s and 90s.\u000a Yeah. All right, so now we need to go ahead and do what? You've done your three trials, what's the next?\u000a Average.\u000a Average.\u000a All right, let's see. We got 182, 172, and 179. \u000a 533.\u000a 533, and then what are you going to do?\u000a Divide it by three.\u000a Okay, divide by three.\u000a 177.666667.\u000a So we can round that up to?\u000a To 178.\u000a 178. Is that pretty close? So you got... Your trials are pretty close together. 182--\u000a 172 and 179.\u000a So you predicted that it would increase by raising the ramp. Was that true?\u000a Yes.\u000a So your prediction came true. Let's turn over the back side, and let's finish the rest of that lab part.\u000a So were there any trials that your team did not record? We only did it... We didn't do that one because it flipped off.\u000a It, like, hit this chip card and it just, like, went whoo!\u000a It went like...\u000a All right, that's a good one not to include. Let's write that down. We didn't include one because it hit a chip hard.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah, that's good.\u000a It just like flew off to the side and it went all the way, like...\u000a Did it really?\u000a Yeah, it just...\u000a That's crazy.\u000a It was funny because... It was also funny because it was going straight, but then it just...\u000a That's weird.\u000a Turned.\u000a That's weird that it hit that... That that caused it to, you know, make such a turn.\u000a But then, like, . The whole time it's been going to the, the right side.\u000a Oh, okay. So it's been curving?\u000a Yeah, it kind of like tilted, and...\u000a That's a good idea. Yeah, that's a real good idea.\u000a Okay, so, question two. What was the average distance the Jeep rolled with the five-centimeter height? So the five-centimeter height.\u000a On the back side of that.\u000a We got an average of 30, 93.\u000a 93, all right, so write that one down, 93. Did that surprise you, it would go 93?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Is that farther, that's what you thought?\u000a I never thought we'd actually get to the end of it.\u000a Yeah, that's a--\u000a But then we actually did with those little toy cars.\u000a Yeah.\u000a And this is actually an older-looking toy car.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Because whenever I roll one wheel, the other wheel rolls just a little.\u000a Oh, yeah. Okay. So you thought maybe the wheels would have something to do with it?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay.\u000a But I never thought it would actually go that far.\u000a Okay. So you're now on number three, right?\u000a What was the average distance the Jeep rolled  10-centimeter height? That was 178.\u000a Okay. So, 178. It looks like the next question is, did the Jeep roll shorter or longer distance?\u000a Longer.\u000a Longer. Can we figure out how much farther?\u000a Yes.\u000a What would we have to do?\u000a The 10-centimeter average minus the 5-centimeter average, and then your answer would be how... Like, the distance between.\u000a Well, why don't you do that? Why don't you pull that up? The 178...  You know, it's always better when you can incorporate those into your answers. You know, it increased by one... Or it was 85 higher. It's always better when you can show your answer with data. When you can increase that it makes your answer seem more valid, right? All right, so maybe can include that, and then move on to that number five there. Okay? All right. You guys are doing a great job. Hey, have you guys gone through everything you needed to do on the front side? Did you read all these first? You gotta read this whole section of your lab first, okay? Yeah, so I would read this part first and then move on, okay? All right.  All right, how you guys doing?\u000a Good.\u000a All right, so you guys have done your first trial on this one. Now, did you do this one here?\u000a I don't...\u000a Let's look at our directions. It says change the ramp back to five centimeters high. Did you do that?\u000a No, sir.\u000a Okay, let's do that. All right.\u000a Sandpaper?\u000a And then I think it... Doesn't it say...\u000a It says tile floor.\u000a It says tile floor, so we're going to measure on the tile. \u000a I get to race it.\u000a All right, are we ready? Now I'm going to move over here. Now, what vehicle we got here?\u000a You should move over there because it always goes over here.\u000a Oh, it always moves over here?\u000a Yeah.\u000a It has a curve?\u000a Yeah.\u000a How about if I move back over here? Will that work? All right, you ready?\u000a Right here?\u000a Yeah, that's good. Oh, you're right. Good thing I moved.\u000a I'll hold it down. Hold that down.\u000a Now, in your first experiment, Annie, while they're doing this, what did it? When you increased the height of the ramp, did it increase?\u000a Yeah, it went faster.\u000a It went what?\u000a It went faster because it had more force.\u000a Okay, so it had more force.  So why do you guys think by increasing the height of the ramp on the first lab, it had more force? All right.\u000a It's more steeper.\u000a Okay.\u000a And the more steeper it is, the more, less friction it would cause, so it could go faster.\u000a Okay. What was the force that was bringing it down the ramp?\u000a Gravity.\u000a Gravity. So you can you conclude from your model experiment that when you increase the steepness of the ramp, the pull of gravity is greater?\u000a Yeah, because it's going more .\u000a Okay, all right.\u000a It's going down, going faster.\u000a Okay.\u000a And then when it gets, if it gets down safely, it'll just go farther because it has more speed.\u000a Okay. Great. All right, so we're on trial two, aren't we?\u000a Yes.\u000a Let's do it.\u000a Go!\u000a You do have that, it does have that curved roll.\u000a Oh, it landed on the--\u000a On the back of it.\u000a There's like a cargo of some sort in the back of it.\u000a Is it, is there a--\u000a There's cargo in the...\u000a 113.\u000a Wait, wait, hold on. Let's double check. What I would do, maybe, is bring your Jeep over.\u000a Yeah, but then it's--\u000a 106.\u000a No, but then it's...\u000a Oh, you're on the... Are you going to the front?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, 113, yeah, you're right.\u000a No, but then you're going at an angle.\u000a And you don't let it go.\u000a Yeah, I mean, either way, I think you're going to get a... As long as you--\u000a That's the way we're doing it from here.\u000a Well, you know, as long as you do the same thing every time, then you should be consistent, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a All right, one more roll, right?\u000a One more.\u000a And then we have it, yeah.\u000a One more roll, Jordan. Here we go.\u000a Then we have to add them all up.\u000a Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun! Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.\u000a The only thing is that... Is that farther? Don't you think it's farther? Are we ready?\u000a Maybe it's because of me.\u000a Do you think you have anything to do with it?\u000a Yeah.\u000a You do, huh?\u000a Go!\u000a Fire! \u000a 117.\u000a How far?\u000a 117.\u000a 117, all right.\u000a 117.\u000a So now, wait. Now Thiago, the math whiz, has to do his math.\u000a All right, so how do you find the average again?\u000a We do... We do... We add them all up, and then we divide it by the number of times you rolled it.\u000a Okay, let's do it.\u000a So we rolled it three times.\u000a You ready? Let's find our average.\u000a Pencil, please!\u000a Oh, you guys aren't even using a calculator.\u000a No, we haven't been.\u000a We only use it for the division.\u000a Oh, you only use it for the division. Hey, I like that.\u000a Sometimes, sometimes. Sometimes we still need it.\u000a What do you guys got?\u000a 10.\u000a That's zero.\u000a 10.\u000a To zero, add up the...\u000a Four, and three.\u000a So 340.\u000a So you're going to take 340, and then you're going to divide it.\u000a Divided by three.\u000a And Thiago can usually do that.\u000a You get 113.3333333.\u000a All right, well, check it out on a calculator, just to make sure.\u000a Okay.\u000a How can you do that in your head without a calculator?\u000a I don't know.\u000a Yeah, but how do you do that? What did you say the number was, Thiago?\u000a It was 113.33333.\u000a All right, here we go.\u000a It's 113, come on, Thiago. \u000a 113.333333333. He got it. All right, nice job, man. All right, so 113. Is that pretty consistent, though?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah, because we had a 113.\u000a Yeah, you did. And that was your middle score, wasn't it?\u000a Yeah.\u000a And really, if you take the thing--\u000a And then we gotta do this one.\u000a No, never mind. I think if you take four here and you put it here...\u000a Yeah, if you take three here, put it here, then you have one more here.\u000a Yep. All right. So now what we're going to do, it says to add sandpaper to the bottom of the ramp.\u000a Which we did.\u000a And predict whether it's going to go. We'll have to redo those, won't we?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So let's erase those, because you had the ramp at how high?\u000a 10 centimeters.\u000a 10, and we needed to... We need to have an equal trial. We need to have it at the same distance, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So the question is... Sit up for me, Jordan. I know we got a lot of space here. What are we going to... Do you think it's gonna go shorter or a farther distance?\u000a It's gonna go shorter.\u000a Why?\u000a Because there's more friction. Sandpaper's rough, so it creates more friction.\u000a Okay.\u000a Slow down the thing.\u000a Okay, what do you think?\u000a When it slows it down, it may slow it down and then it says, the car starts to turn, just because... Just because it's our car, goes out to the side, so it goes more to the side.\u000a All right.\u000a Than it usually does.\u000a What do you guys think? Farther or shorter?\u000a I think it'll go shorter because... The gravity may be pulling it down, but the sandpaper is really rough like Thiago said, and it would, like, stop it to make it not move anymore. It would, like barely get off the paper.\u000a Okay, can you guys, like... Say you're riding your bike. And you ride your bike on smooth pavement, and then you ride it on a rough surface. Is it easier to ride on the smooth or the rough?\u000a Smooth.\u000a The smooth, right? So can we use that to help us make our prediction?\u000a It actually could be faster on the bumps more, because if you hit a bump... If you're going fast enough and you hit a big enough bump, you could actually go in the air.\u000a Okay, maybe. All right, let's go and test this thing out, and see if you guys are right. Annie, while we're setting up this lab, can you go ahead and write your prediction? And it looks like you need to grab your sandpaper there. Now, I can't sit here, can I? This is the bad seat. I gotta move.\u000a Well, I say you sit--\u000a It doesn't go very far anymore on the sandpaper.\u000a All right, well, let's set it up there. That one there, right? And that one there?\u000a Four centimeters more.\u000a All right, let's look. We went 113. With the sandpaper, how far do you think it's gonna go? Let's make a prediction.\u000a I think it'll go maybe half that, or even less than half that.\u000a Okay, so what would half of 113 be? What's that close to?\u000a I don't know. I think that would be maybe...\u000a 500?\u000a 500 and...\u000a No, you want half of it.\u000a Oh, five, okay. Half of it.\u000a 50.\u000a I think, there you go, 50, yeah.\u000a 50.\u000a All right.\u000a 52...\u000a 51 point .\u000a 50 point, like...\u000a Okay. All right, are we ready for the first roll? Let's do it. Let's get our first trial. Here we go. We're ready.\u000a Wait, who hasn't rolled?\u000a Has Emma not rolled? Okay, all right, good. I like the way your group's working together there.\u000a All right.\u000a Here we go. Oh. Should we use that trial, or should we try a different one?\u000a Try again.\u000a Let's try one more. Maybe we can get that--\u000a Well, scoot it right over here.\u000a And we could even scoot the sandpaper, like, there.\u000a Yeah.\u000a All right, you ready? All right, there it is.\u000a It didn't even move off the sandpaper.\u000a Let's give it...\u000a Can someone hold that down? Can someone hold that down, please?\u000a Here we go. This is our test. Is the prediction right?\u000a The sandpaper's hard.\u000a It is, it's rough, isn't it?\u000a Yeah.\u000a 49.\u000a Now, aren't you on the front?\u000a Yeah, which would be a 49.\u000a Yeah, but you mean... Or maybe you're  about 50?\u000a Yeah, about 50.\u000a You guys were pretty close in your prediction, weren't you? Half.\u000a It was like 50.\u000a Yeah, Jordan said 50 1/2.\u000a All right, you guys got two more trials, right?\u000a I said 51 1/2. You said 51 1/2.\u000a All right, ready?\u000a Yeah. Oh, man.\u000a Really?\u000a Let's like keep it down.\u000a Or maybe we'll hold it down next time, yeah.\u000a Yeah, I think that's the problem. It's scooting back.\u000a That was 50...\u000a 47.\u000a Yeah, 47.\u000a Okay.\u000a Almost in half.\u000a All right, I'll hold it on this side. Are we ready? Here we go.\u000a

V Let's go.\u000a Okay.\u000a  Continue.\u000a Yes. All right scholars, here's my question. What do you think...actually, let me start by quoting the passage. So it says, they can either trust or predict what Chacko's attitude would be, and they were trying to hide that, get rid of it all, before Chacko returned. So, what do you think Chacko's opinion of all of this chaos would be?\u000a Could you just be particular with... the chaos you were talking about? What's that?\u000a The entire situation, the steamy love affair, and the reaction on Baby Kochamma's part. And Mammachi's part.\u000a Got it.\u000a I don't think he'd be happy about the love affair, cause as it says, it's like, she had defiled generations of breeding like the little blessed one, blessed personally by the Patriarch of...\u000a  Antioch.\u000a Antioch, an imperial entomologist, and Rhodes Scholar from Oxford, so it's like she had taken what their family had worked for for so long, and just... thrown it out the window.\u000a I'm gonna have to disagree with that Becca, I mean, I think that Chacko is a liberal type. He is very progressive, he's a Marxist, he didn't allow his father to beat his mother as most Indians...Traditionalists, probably would be OK with. I think that Chacko would be no more angry about the whole affair than anybody would be if, some guy was having an affair with his sister. As a social ideal, I think he would be fine with everything.\u000a I agree because I feel like, oh God I had this whole plan of something to say and I can't remember. Sorry.\u000a No, it's not your fault.\u000a  Well, what is the only thing that made Chacko upset at Mammachi?\u000a Was it that she abandoned her children? Oh, I got it. Yeah, I feel like the most of this passage, though it's third person narration, it really feels like it's coming out of Baby Kochamma's mouth, and it's like her diction throughout all of the italicized stuff. The whole central paragraph where it uses a lot of dirty diction like mud and filthy and coarse and black. To quote the passage once again. So, I feel like that all really Baby Kochamma's words and not necessarily Baba's beliefs, and I feel like they have really contrasted beliefs.\u000a  Yeah, I mean I feel like all the diction you were talking about, for instance, when it says, "Mammachi's rage at the old one-eyed Paravan standing in the rain, drunk, dribbling and covered in mud..." And it repeats mud a lot, and I think it's... that's just kind of dirty and the action is really impure and they're trying... and almost like mud covers things up. So it's almost like it should be covered up. And they were trying to cover it up.\u000a But don't you feel like they used Chacko not being there and coming back as an excuse to do everything they do. Oh, he's coming back so we have to do this. They kind of use him as the excuse to do it.\u000a Well, it's sort of like Chacko could intervene, and so we have to do it now so we can't miss our chance to do it again.\u000a I think that's important, actually. I think that a theme of unintended consequences like it says here, "It wasn't their fault when the whole "thing spun like a deranged top." I think the theme of unintended consequences is really crucial to both the book and the movie. In the movie, for example, when Mahuditi says she thinks she knows what the consequences will be if Kayani gets married, but the unintended consequences confound the defilement that she commits by him being around.\u000a I think that's... this book and movie is really trying to say, is this is what happens when you set up rules and don't adapt to social conditions which are inevitably bound to change. \u000a I'll just go.  In the fourth paragraph, they talk about having a plan. It's very orderly, and they said that Kochu Maria was a midget lieutenant. They had this very organized and planned out, even though in the second paragraph, "she shuddered with a school-girl shudder." It's like her childish emotions are being turned into or coming out through her adult form where she has the power to do stuff.\u000a Yeah, on that I really want to say cause it says, "school-girl shudder" at the beginning. And then it back in the fourth paragraph, when it's talking about their plan, they're referred to as, "the two old ladies". So that's contrasting in a way to be described, which obviously it's important.\u000a Yeah, I think that's one of the themes of the passage. Conflicts between age and which one is ultimately... I don't want to say better, but a better advantage. I guess.\u000a Like in authority?\u000a Between age and youth, you mean?\u000a Between old and young.\u000a Yeah, age and youth. Which one can have a better life according to them.\u000a They also play with age. When they locked Ammu up, it's kind of like putting her in time out, like they tricked her in to her room, which is also a parallel I saw in the movie when they locked Kalyani up so she couldn't get married. It was to keep them from doing stuff.\u000a I just want to bring up another theme of the passage. Where it's the very beginning where it's before we are completely ruined by the . It kind of presents this idea that society is not built on the basis of individual needs, what you do. In this society, at least, affects everybody around you. And it kind of contrasts Ammu's individualism with what societal hierarchy, and how these two women are higher on the hierarchy, so they have authority over her, and so they're telling her not to do this. And they're presenting their authority over her. And Chacko's even higher than them, just cause he's a guy.\u000a When the passage lists the life cycle events, the weddings, the funerals, baptisms, and birthday parties, it says for generations to come, so I feel like what Peter was saying, it affects all of society. That also ties in with the age because the weddings are for younger people. The funerals are when you die. The baptisms are when you are just born. So it's saying it will affect everybody at all parts of their life, that's how profound it is.\u000a And even that sentence that Peter was talking about, before it goes any further. Before we are completely ruined, I think that's also just family selfishness because they're just projecting what her... the consequences of her actions will be for them. Not necessarily for her. And in the movie, where the leader of that house of she's just really concerned about herself. She'll sacrifice all of the other women just so she's comfortable.\u000a But does she also use a we. I think both Baby Kochamma and Diti say the same thing. We're gonna be ruined by this. We we we. \u000a In regards to that, I think... In water, you know how all the widows they sorta put them together, and they sort of create this unity. It's all out of despair because they all lost something. In a sense, Mammachi lost her former love, and so did Ammu. Ammu had babies without... It wasn't a formal tradition. The way she had her babies. And so in a sense, she has... She's in grievance, and so those two aspects unites these women.\u000a Yeah, they're all widows.\u000a Yeah, they're all widows. and that really...\u000a But does that give them right to be...\u000a Oh understand, that's why I feel like it says, "we". Not "we", like our family, but more of like, "we" women who are widowed.\u000a  Austin, what do you think? Do you think that gives them the right to... because they've also lost and because Baby Kochamma and Mammachi has also experienced trauma, so that also means Diti, as well. Her husband died when she was young. Does that give them the right to take that...?\u000a I don't think so, cause that was actually one of my questions. Especially when it says, "Her tolerance immense needs, as far as her son "was concerned became the fuel for "unimaginable fury at her daughter". And then just my question was, is Baby Kochamma's actions motivated by Indian society or her own emotions? So I don't think that they should be able to from their past experience... take it out on everybody else.\u000a I think that what we're talking about right now, maybe be reason that Ghandi appears at the end of the film. Because Ghandi, as he is portrayed in water is a symbol of rationalism. And it's... when he shows up, nice Diti sees that  may have a refuge from cycles of hatred and of tradition conceived for the purpose of basically personal gain. Ghandi's existence in the movie is indictments of almost every action taken in this passage by the scheming old women.\u000a I think that Ghandi, in the movie, represents more of rebirth because they talk about how much society will change once Ghandi takes power. The widows will gain power. The untouchables won't be untouchable anymore. They'll gain more rights. So I think they look at him as, not really rationalism, because some people think that he's just crazy. The Brahmin caste don't see him as rational, so I think it's more of a hope in an idealized society.\u000a Building off of what she said, how Ghandi represents re-birth, I think coincides with the movie's title, "Water". For me, at least, the way I saw it. I felt like water was rebirth throughout the movie. They washed themselves... it was washing away their sins. Being reborn. I thought who's the girl? The one who killed herself.\u000a Kalyani\u000a I thought that it was symbolic when she drown herself. Because the way she was killing herself, she was submersing herself in water, and I thought since water was clearing away your sins and stuff, she in a sense, she was clearing away her sins. And so she would go to the next life sinless.\u000a I think that the drowning of Kalyani parallels to how Sophie Mol drowned. How it's like the innocent life was taken by the water. Which isn't really... innocence, too.\u000a But was Kalyani innocent?\u000a I think that if she hadn't been forced to do things  she would have been... she didn't feel right about what she had done.\u000a I'm gonna take the opposite view point to the water that symbols of inescapability in the movie because of the way... in both the movie and the book. It says the fisherman had already found Sophie Mol. She... They drowned trying to cross the river, and Kalyani loses everything when she crosses the river and realizes who Norian really is. The river is important in both works. It's an inescapable wall. So I don't think water is portrayed as a good image.\u000a I mean, it could possibly be both. I think Peter made a pretty good point about it. Sam did with Kalyani's death and Sophie Mol's death. But I think it could be both.\u000a I think it's a duality thing. And then going on combining what both ya'll said, where you said it's an inescapably, and the way they view it as washing away their sins. View it as a cleansing thing also, for example, emphasizes the irrationality of all their beliefs. And they're cleaning themself in this... if water is just viewed a symbol, they're cleaning themselves with something that's bad. I also don't think that...\u000a They depend on the water, too, to get their food from it. They wash themselves in it. Yet, it's also... it creates this... it's something that the Paravans are trying to overcome. A lot of people are trying to overcome this barrier, but they depend on it. They still need it. So it's contrasting what they believe...\u000a Just like a duality thing.\u000a Yeah.\u000a It's the family and God's talkings. Their immediate family. They depend on each other because when you're a child, you have to have an older figure to help you grow up. But, they are also... They cause the turmoil with each other. They create their own problems, pretty much.\u000a It's like you can't live with them, but you can't live without them.\u000a  Susan, did you have a question?\u000a  Yes, I did. Well, a lot of them are about similarities between characters. But one thing that I thought about was how Norian dealt with his lover's loss, and how Velutha was able to deal with being separated from... Ammu. And do you think that their status influenced how they were able to deal with the situations?\u000a Sorry, I missed all this. \u000a So she\u000a  I heard\u000a Well, Norian, because he was a Brahmin, the highest caste, I think he said we'll either going to Calcutta or India, ? to start his life.\u000a You mean Kolkata?\u000a Or, I'm sorry, or England. To become a lawyer. So he had the option of completely starting his life over wherever he wanted to go because he had education, and he could provide for himself. Velutha was an untouchable, so he had no opportunity.\u000a

I think that might've been a little too hard. Tap on it again. Good. \u266a  \u266a Andrew... Yep. Click on it again. Thank you, Andrew. And, It. \u266a It \u266a Riley... Good job. Now, boys and girls, I would like you to put your sticks on your shoulders and even though we're not finished with the heart chart, I want you to clap your ti ti and your ta for each beat. Make sure you're looking up here and you know which one to clap and say. We're going to clap and say it. Ready? Go.\u000a  Ti ti. Ti ti. Ti ti. Ti ti. Ti ti. Ti ti.\u000a,  The eighth note or the quarter note? Raise your hand if you know. Maddox, what does Holly's song start with?\u000a  Eighth note.\u000a The eighth note and is that ti ti or ta, Mason? Is this ti ti or ta? Ti ti, very good. One, two everybody now.\u000a  Ti, ti, ti, ti, ta, ti, ti, ta, ta, ti, ti, ta.\u000a Very good. Let's move on and let's, oops, no talking. Let's open up Griffin's. His song is called "Jaws." What does this start with? Raise your hand if you can tell me. What does this start with, Bear? A quarter note or an eighth note? A quarter note very good. One, two everybody play.\u000a  Ta, ti, ti, ta, ti, ti, ti, ti, ta, ti, ti, ta.\u000a Now this one's tricky because we went ti, ti, ti, ti. So let's try that again. One, two ready go.\u000a  Ta, ti, ti, ta, ti, ti, ti, ti, ta, ti, ti, ta.\u000a Raise your hand if you can tell me how many beats does the quarter note get? Chandler, how many beats?

How many heartbeats do the eighth notes get?\u000a Two.\u000a Lilly?\u000a  One.\u000a One, very good. They both just get one. All right, let's try it again fixing  the ti, ti, ti, ti. Going from here to here. One, two ready go.\u000a  Ta, ti, ti, ta, ti, ti, ti, ti, ta, ti, ti, ta.\u000a That was much better, good job. Okay let's move on to somebody else's song. That was "Jaws" by Griffin. Let's go to Lilly Dee's song. Her song is "Pink Butterflies." One, two everybody play.\u000a  Ta, ta, ti, ti, ta, ti, ti, ta, ta, ti, ti.\u000a Excellent job. Let's go move on to somebody else's. Let's see Bear's song.

V You're not doing your job.  Follow the arrow.  Good.  Just a little bit. Why? Why do we say the wiffle ?\u000a Because it .\u000a Because nothing in it. It's holes. Then is it the holes and nothing in it makes it heavy or light?\u000a Light.\u000a Light. Good.\u000a Next, what do we have to do? We have all our arrows down. Good. Exactly. Okay.  Thank you. Someone needs to hold this here.  I have a job for you. Come hold the clip. Hold this here. Hold this here. Come around here. Come here sweetie. Right here. Hold this.  Okay, now let's count. Go to there and I'll help .  Okay. Good. Good boy.\u000a Oh, no.\u000a Uh, oh. \u000a Put it in the basket. Put it in the basket. Good.  You have to help her count.  I need to hear you. Should I could count 30?\u000a No.\u000a No. It's not far .  When this is 20.\u000a 21\u000a Good.  Is that more than the wiffle ball? This one? More than this? Is this one more? Sebastian? Yes. Good.  Good. 52. Write your 52 down.  What's the problem? What? What have you done here?  Okay. I see  working on her turn. She hasn't done anything? Because we're not helping? What? Which one did you roll?  You don't need this . You're not to this point yet. First you're doing the rolling. Okay. You need to move to the side.  Now, help her.  Okay. Good. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, okay.  Good. Now, it's  turn.  Okay, now. You help her by holding the end.  No, it's fine. I can tell what it is. You're doing a good job. Someone needs to hold this end.  right here. Hold the end right here. Okay, now. Perfect. Now, we have to help her count. So she can write her numbers down. Okay, start with the first one, the wiffle ball. How far is the wiffle ball?  Starting 10 here? Is this 10? Where's the 10? Good. You think that's how far it is? Okay, so write that down. Put in wiffle ball.\u000a  I said I'm next. I said I'm next.\u000a I'm looking now at .  asked about yours. I think you have your numbers in the wrong spot. Which went further? Wiffle ball? Which one? Which one went far? The baseball, okay. Because I think on our list, you have them written backwards. We'll fix them. We'll find them with the right picture.  Okay, let's see what the problem is. The one's got to go on this side. Please help her count where the baseball is. Count with her.\u000a 14 \u000a Is there a faster way we could've done that? By doing what? By doing what? Exactly, by counting by 10s. We could've started here and gone\u000a 20\u000a 20 and then count  from there. You're right. Good. So, who's next? Steven.  Now what's going on here? Sarah was saying something . What's happening?  No, remember, you did this .  Together, count them.\u000a 20  Well, let's look.  It does look like .\u000a 3.\u000a Yes. Good.  Write it on the board.  But you two can start . And then you two can start. You hold the .  Good. Mark it. Good.  Where does the ball go? Put it in the basket.  Excellent. Help the boys now. You can hold the ramp. It looks like it's about to fall. Too late . Wait, wait. All the things to say.  Now with the rubber ball. Exactly.  This one's called the what? Wiff-?\u000a Wiffle ball.\u000a Wiffle ball.  What happened with the balls?  Hold it. Let me look at yours. You got yours done? What happened with yours? What happened with the baseball?\u000a It went .\u000a Which one went the farthest?\u000a This one.\u000a How about yours? Which one of yours went the farthest? Yeah, the baseball. Remember, we talked about that.  The ball should be in the basket, so it doesn't go under the chair. \u000a  counting. What happened? No, but what happened here? Someone has to hold it, you're right. Can you hold it? Good. That's better.\u000a 30\u000a This is 50.\u000a 50  start again.  each one.\u000a 51\u000a Pablo. Which one of the balls went furthest?  The baseball? What did we talk about when we said at the beginning? Which ball did we think was going to go the farthest? The baseball. Why did you think it was going to go furthest?\u000a Because .  right?\u000a Yes.\u000a How about yours? And, Sarah's too? Did the baseball go the farthest?  That far?  That was a hard push, exactly.  That was a soft and that was a soft. Which one was the softest?\u000a Two.\u000a Which one was a really soft push? The wiffle ball. Why? Why did we say that?\u000a Because, the ball .\u000a Just a little bit. What happened when you weighed the ball? When you put them in the balance?\u000a The baseball get's heavier.\u000a The baseball was heavier. Baseball needed nine magnet weights, you're right. You remember. It was heavy. Good.  you're absolutely right.  Okay, help him count to his wiffle ball. Hold the end.\u000a

V The yellow has less water\u000a That's true.\u000a And more H plus.\u000a Because a higher concentration of \u000a The higher the concentration of the acid?\u000a Yes.\u000a Yes.\u000a So you think it's something about the acid that's causing the color.\u000a Yeah.\u000a What about the blue food coloring?  This stays the same?\u000a Yeah.\u000a But why would you think this stays the same and it's the acid that's changing color?  Okay, so the concentration of the blue food coloring is the same, but the amount of acid is not. So I must be changing the color of the acid. So it's the acid that's changing color.\u000a You're not changing the color of the acid, though.\u000a Anybody else got ideas about that? That something else that could explain it? That's one hypothesis.\u000a You put the same amount of food coloring in every time, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Wait, so the acid is probably likely to, maybe like lose an electron?\u000a The acid loses electrons?  What is an acid?  It gives up an H plus, right?\u000a There are more moles of Hydrogen ions...\u000a Right, acid's dissociate. So I got more molds of H plus in this one. Okay, Emma, you have an idea?\u000a Well, there are more, I think I might have gotten it confused. Basically, there's a higher concentration of acid as you go along, right?\u000a So more here.\u000a Yeah. There's more when it's lighter.\u000a Lowest, most.\u000a Yeah, I know.\u000a Okay.\u000a So that gives it more reason for a more drastic color change, then. Because there are more H pluses, if you will, that could cause it to jump in energy.\u000a Okay, so you got the idea of energy is some kind of, something's jumping. Because you know...\u000a Could it be the separation between the two sets of the orbital in the food coloring itself that's changing?\u000a Okay.\u000a Which is why the blue color changes to the, like, brownish yellow.\u000a So now what is your idea about what's changing color?\u000a The orbital, the food coloring is changing color.\u000a The food coloring is changing color.\u000a Yeah, the food, okay, so that makes sense. The food coloring is changing color, but the acid concentration is making it change color.\u000a Yeah.\u000a So the food coloring's like the dependent variable, right?\u000a What is in the food coloring?\u000a That's a good question.\u000a That's what we need to know.\u000a What is in the food coloring? The same thing that's in the cabbage indicator, actually. Well, something similar, they're called anthocyanins. And I have a little handout to show you what they look like. So, before we do that though. Actually, no, I'll show you a picture of an anthocyanin and have you hypothesize a little bit more about what might be happening here. So here's an anthocyanin. It's this molecule here. So usually anthocyanins have lots of benzene rings in them. Okay? So what is happening, what is causing the different colors? So we had the idea of something to do with orbitals and something jumping.\u000a In the food coloring.\u000a In the food coloring.\u000a But the food coloring isn't transition metal.\u000a It's not a transition metal, no.\u000a Can you still have that happen?\u000a Well, what else could there be?\u000a Well I think it's the O-H because,\u000a Is it like splitting up the p-orbitals?\u000a What makes you say that?\u000a There's like SP-3 orbitals and I guess p2 orbitals  .\u000a Okay, so are you saying it's that splitting of SP-3 and SP-2 orbitals or the P orbitals?\u000a I was thinking it's the P orbitals.\u000a Okay, so what here would represent the P orbitals?\u000a Whatever bonded with the acid. The O-H maybe?\u000a Oh, would it be the   no.\u000a Okay, so here's what we're going to do. I'm going to give you this handout, and what I would like you to do. I want you to highlight all of the double bonds in one color. Then I want you to highlight all of the single bonds in another color, okay? You should have highlighters by your table.\u000a Purple.\u000a I'll take green. \u000a Do you want us to do it for all of them?\u000a Yeah, let's just do it, let's do it for the first one to start with. Anthocyanins in red wine, we'll do that. So, anthocyanins are in lots of different compounds. Anything that has color really, wine, grapes, cabbage, red onions, food coloring.\u000a Are they, they're not in colorless though, right? Or are they?\u000a Say it again?\u000a They can't be colorless, because it's colorless.\u000a Well, kind of, you'll see. We'll explain that in a little bit, yeah.\u000a Is something colorless because they don't have any d electrons, or like the d-orbital is filled up with electrons? Or are there other factors?\u000a Yes, that's true for transition metals,\u000a But for other things?\u000a For other things that are colorless, what would explain why they were colorless?\u000a It would have to be a different orbital.\u000a Different wave length.\u000a Like the absorption, based on the bond. Yes to both of you. So Riley's idea is that maybe, so what did we say color came from earlier?  Color in general, where does color in general come from? Reflecting certain frequencies, and absorbing other frequencies of light right? Okay, so we can only see purple to red. So is there another explanation for why something might be colorless? Because it ...\u000a Probably because it's absorbing everything?\u000a Well, if it was absorbing everything, what color would it be?\u000a Black.\u000a Oh, it's not absorbing anything.\u000a It's not absorbing anything? Or not absorbing ...\u000a Any color.\u000a It's not absorbing what we can see.\u000a It's not absorbing what we can see, that's right. It's not absorbing what we can see.\u000a It reflects all the colors.\u000a So, you guys see a pattern yet? Can I borrow somebody's? Let me borrow yours. Let's put it under the camera as an example here. What do you notice?\u000a Were we supposed to highlight...\u000a Single bonds, yes. What do you notice about the relationships between double and single bonds? The double bonds right next to each other?\u000a The double bonds are next to the single bonds.\u000a The double bond are next to the single bonds. That's right, that's right. Okay, in the first one, where you have, What color is the first one, does is say?\u000a It just says colored.\u000a Red wine.\u000a But we have colored and we have colorless. Okay, so in the colored one, how many, can you count how many times it goes double-single, double-single, double-single? That's like a tongue twister. \u000a It's seven in colored?\u000a I got seven.\u000a Okay, so now count colorless and see what you get. What did you guys get?\u000a For double-single? I got like 14.\u000a Okay, so are you counting double and single as ...\u000a Yeah, yeah.\u000a Okay so you basically got seven, too. Okay, so do colorless now.\u000a Double bonds between every single bond, between the bonds with the C N-O.\u000a I got eight for colored. \u000a I got 17 in the singles, and eight doubles for that.\u000a Okay, what's the difference between colored and colorless, basically? And the number of double and single bonds?\u000a There are more singles than colorless.\u000a Okay, not the total numbers, oh wait, there's more singles than colorless? Okay, that's a way we can look at it. Okay, see if the same...\u000a We got seven for colorless.\u000a Okay.\u000a Is it supposed to be the same number?\u000a No no, no it's not supposed to be the same.  Alright, let's hear what Gracie has to say. Say what you just said.\u000a So, in colored there's more doubles and there's less singles. So that means that there's going to be more of the single-doubles. But then in colorless there's less doubles and more singles, so that means there's less single-doubles.\u000a Can somebody restate that? Just so that I can make sure that you understand what she said?\u000a Does that mean that if there are more double bonds than there are, that colors .\u000a So, say it again.\u000a When there are more double bonds there's a color, or something.\u000a Okay, when there's more double bonds there's a color. Does that seem like the pattern we're noticing here?\u000a It has to do with pi bonding.\u000a Why does it have to do with pi bonding?\u000a Because it's an overlap of p-orbitals.\u000a Overlap of p-orbitals.\u000a Which allows the delocalized electrons to like...\u000a Okay, so what did you say, Con?\u000a Delocalization.\u000a Delocalization, the delocalization comes from...  Pi bonds, what is a pi bond? It's the overlap of what?\u000a P-orbitals.\u000a P-orbitals, p-orbitals okay. So when it goes double-single, double-single, double-single, what's happening there? How does that create...\u000a It's like one big pi bond. Like when you have, like earlier you were talking about whatcha-ma-call-its, I can't articulate...\u000a Delocalization?\u000a No, like...\u000a One giant p-orbital?\u000a Yeah, like sort of, yeah one giant p-orbital. Like one giant pi bond, it like expands from like through different,\u000a Oh, and like a benzene shape, and then that makes a circle? Yeah, and it's not actually like here's one,  here's one pi bond, here's one pi bond, here's one. It's like they're like all pi bonded.\u000a They're like all pi bonded to each other, okay. So in which case, in which case are they all pi bonded to each other? The colored form, or the colorless form? \u000a I'd say colored because they are all close to each other. Like the pi bonds.\u000a The pi bonds, say it again.\u000a They're close to each other.\u000a They're close to each other in the colored form? So is there more...\u000a There's more double bonds.\u000a There's more double bonds in the colored?\u000a Yeah, so they would have to be closer to each other. \u000a There are more double bonds in colored, less double bonds in colorless.\u000a Okay, so how many of you say there's less double bonds in the colorless? Less double bonds in the colorless? Three.\u000a There's only seven double bonds in colorless and there's eight in colored. And there's more leftover singles. \u000a Wait, for which one, for colored?\u000a Oh, you're counting the far left one. \u000a Yeah, this one has eight.\u000a This is an intermediate one?\u000a So then it's seven and seven.\u000a Seven and seven, okay. So how many, if you were to try to connect. So the idea is that it makes one giant p-orbital. If you were going to connect all of the p-orbitals, which one would have the most gigantic p-orbital?\u000a Colored\u000a Colored. Is that clear to everybody? Why did you say colorless? Did you say colorless?\u000a Yeah, I don't understand why.\u000a Because there's  a bunch of single bonds.\u000a Because the pi bond is more in the middle of the two other things .\u000a Wait, for the far left?\u000a Does that make any sense?\u000a We're talking about the far left one.\u000a Let's look at all three. So which one of these is going to have the most giant pi bond?\u000a The middle one?\u000a The middle one.\u000a Because it's an intermediate.\u000a And they're more double bonds.\u000a Does anyone disagree that it's going to be the middle one that would have the most giant p-orbital? Okay. Alright, let's look at some more down here. Did you guys do, does somebody have these highlighted?\u000a No.\u000a I think Rebecca, you have them highlighted, right? \u000a Okay, so let's look at these two here. Can we apply our hypothesis? So what is our hypothesis by the way?\u000a More overlap of p-orbitals the more colored it is?\u000a Okay, the more overlap of p-orbitals the more colored it is. That's our hypothesis. Is it supported by these two on the side here?\u000a Can we highlight the exterior?\u000a So what do you think? Is our hypothosis supported by these two? Alright, Con, can you explain?\u000a Well, I mean it just looks like there's a bunch of conjunctions of single bonds where the streak of double-single is kind of broken.\u000a Okay, right, so there's a streak of double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single. So imagine you start somewhere. Have you guys ever heard the song that never ends?\u000a Yes. \u266b This is the song that never ends \u266b\u000a Okay, we're not gonna sing it, it never ends. So in this case, if we were to just go around going double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single, would I ever get to an end necessarily? Would I here? How about if I went double, still single, double- single, double-single, double-single,\u000a But that's single, single.\u000a Single, single. So which one's going to have a more extensive pi bond? The top one, so that sort of fits our hypothesis that the more pi bonding there is, the more colored it is. Okay, so what causes color in these compounds?\u000a Shared electrons?\u000a More shared electrons, that are shared how? \u000a Pi bonds. \u000a More pi bonds equals what?\u000a More area for the electrons to move around?\u000a Okay, more area for them. More delocalization, okay. So let's take it back to this, to our acid and blue food coloring demonstration. Why are these different colors? What is happening here?  Let's put this together.\u000a Oh, is it the H is taking more of the delocalized electrons because H is positive?\u000a What do you think?\u000a Because there's a higher concentration.\u000a So say it again.\u000a Okay so since H is a positive ion, it takes more of the, since there's more, it takes more of the delocalized electrons?\u000a Okay, so it's taking more of the delocalized electrons. So how does that explain the color change? Can somebody add onto that?\u000a There's less electrons so I guess there's less...\u000a More double bonding?\u000a There's less energy absorbed?\u000a No, there's increased...\u000a So, is more energy being absorbed, or less energy being absorbed when it's yellow?\u000a More energy is being absorbed that's why it's yellow.\u000a Exactly, that creates further  .\u000a Because there are more electrons bonding with the H plus than there is in the...\u000a It's about absorption.\u000a Ah, okay Ruth, say that...\u000a

V Brooke, what did you choose?\u000a  The cylinder.\u000a  Why?  Okay, five, and what about you, Ms. Leah?\u000a  Cylinder.\u000a  Why?\u000a  Because it has two faces.\u000a  It has two faces, and what about you, Ms. Cecilia?  The sphere, and why, you need to write your words down. Okay, so write your words down so you guys can hand in your sheet.\u000a  Who thinks wants to cut? Who think will cut? Here, what about Samantha, then you? Okay, and then me, then Brian. Okay, but he goes, you too. You called... You want to hold and stretch? Well, that's the one you're doing, and you'll be cutting. Okay, so Katie cuts, then Samantha, then me and then Brian. He is going to roll the shapes down the hill. I'll stretch, and you can hold, okay?  Samantha... Wait guys, this is...\u000a  Guys, it's the sphere. Spheres. Those are spheres.\u000a  That's the cylinders. No.\u000a  This is the sphere color, you already got...\u000a Here, how about I'll be...  Who wants cylinder, raise your hand. Who wants sphere? Who wants cylinder? So, it's three versus one. So, do the cylinder first and then use... \u000a  Fine, I'll get on it.\u000a  You guys working it out? Alright. \u000a  Yes, Blake, what do you need?\u000a  We need more string.\u000a  You need more string? Okay, alright. Keep that one right there, and roll one of your other shapes and I'll get you a longer piece of string.\u000a  Okay. \u000a  Hold on, I got it right here. I'll tie it on there, how's that?  Okay, is that going to work for you? Alright, Isaac, go ahead and stretch it out.\u000a  How long it was?\u000a  We need to hang that up. \u000a  You can cut this tie.\u000a  Okay, I'll cut this time. I'll have... Don't roll it now. I can measure it. I'll cut it. Now, Leila roll it down.\u000a  Move the cylinder!  \u000a  Blue, blue, oh we have only blue?\u000a  When you guys are measuring, who's doing the holding? You are? Okay Foster, hold it. Who's doing the stretching? Because you're going to have to stretch it out, you can't cut it until it's stretched. You're stretching, and so Sierra's cutting? Okay Foster, you hold it, you gotta stretch it all the way out. Yeah, okay, cut it right here. Like that. Here, there you go. Open it a little bit more. There you go, okay. And Foster go put it up on the graph, and Sierra you can throw away the extra. Okay, good job. What shape is this, Hunter?\u000a  Sphere.\u000a  Sphere, alright,  and what do you know, what's special about the sphere? It rolls, and what's really special about it?\u000a  It has no faces.\u000a  It has no faces, you're brilliant.  Okay, the next one... \u000a  Whoa!\u000a  You can cut it. You may be able to... \u000a  I want to straighten it. Measure it. \u000a  The sphere went the farthest? So, was your prediction right, Jackson? Was your prediction right?\u000a  Yes. No.\u000a  No.  So, you want to circle no, and you want to circle yes. Anthony, was your prediction right? Okay, so you want to circle the check mark for yes, your prediction was right. And then you guys can get some crayons and draw your observations, and what you saw in your experiment. \u000a  I think... The cylinder.\u000a  Okay, who's letting this go?\u000a  Me.\u000a  Okay, you can't measure it till she lets it go. Ready, go Cecilia, let her go.  Look at the poor little cube. Why do you think it doesn't go very far?\u000a  Because it has sides.\u000a  What kind of sides?\u000a Squares.\u000a  And they're what?\u000a Flat.\u000a  Flat, alright, but now you've picked it up and you can't measure it.  Alright, who's doing the holding? Okay, now hold on a second Leah, so when you measure you want to turn it this way, so the edge is right up against the ramp, and then you hold it tight, and then you can cut it right here, okay? Alright, so who's holding, you are? Okay, alright--\u000a  You hold this, you hold that. Okay, can I go hang that up? Now, we do some... \u000a  Okay, hold on, can you hold this away for a second while she sends it down? Ready? Okay, ready? Alright, now are you the holder? Okay. Use the stretcher.\u000a  Try and stretch the...\u000a  So, Katie, you took Brian's turn last time, honey, so it's his turn. Okay, girls, what shape is this one?\u000a  Rectangular prism.\u000a  And what's special about it?\u000a  Because... Because... Because it has... Because it has rectangle.\u000a  Rectangle what?\u000a Faces.\u000a  Faces, and they are...\u000a  Flat.\u000a  Flat rectangles, right, so did it go very far?\u000a No.\u000a Did anybody pick the rectangular prism to go the farthest? You picked that one? Okay, so now you know, it didn't go too far. Alright, so now you're going to try your...\u000a  Cube.\u000a  Cube, okay good.\u000a  Who's cutting now?\u000a Who? Who's sliding it? Samantha!\u000a  No, I didn't slide it down before.\u000a  Samantha didn't...\u000a  So, were you right Leila?\u000a  Yeah, you did!\u000a  Yes or yes ma'am?\u000a  Yes ma'am.\u000a  Alright, so you can circle your prediction was correct, and then, was your prediction correct, Isaac? No, you guys said the cylinder went the farthest. Was your prediction correct? Okay, so you circle here, your prediction wasn't correct, and then, was your prediction correct, Aspen? No, and what about you Blake, yes? Okay, so now you guys can go ahead and clean up all of your stuff, and then you can get one of the crayon caddies and draw a picture of what happened. Blake, I want you to help your team clean up before you start drawing your observations.  Good job team!\u000a  Hey, that's mine! That's my pencil! \u000a  Wait, I'm not ready yet, I'm not ready yet.\u000a  I got it right. I got it right.\u000a  Yeah, I got it right. I got it right.\u000a  So, which shape do you guys have left? What is that?\u000a  Cone.\u000a  The cone, and what's special about the cone?  And so what happens to it?\u000a  It slides.\u000a  It does slide on its face. What else is special about the cone, Cecilia?\u000a It rolls in a circle.\u000a  Why?\u000a Because...\u000a  You okay?\u000a Because it has a flat face.\u000a  Mm hmm, and what else makes it roll in that circle, Leah?\u000a It has a point.\u000a  It has the point on it, so this is your last one to measure?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Okay, yes or yes ma'am?\u000a  Yes ma'am.\u000a  Alright, good luck.\u000a  You throw that away, I'll throw it away.\u000a  So, was your prediction correct, Hunter?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Yes, so the cylinder went the farthest for you guys? Okay, so Sierra, if the cylinder went the farthest, your prediction wasn't right, so now you're gonna circle the X. Does it matter that you are right?\u000a  No.\u000a  No, you're just predicting, and that means you're guessing, you don't have to be right. Circle the X, and then go ahead and draw your pictures.\u000a  It's orange.\u000a  So, you guys are gonna show the cylinder going the farthest.\u000a  Just do it. Do it here.\u000a  Now, I don't know what's going the farthest.\u000a  It was probably cylinder.\u000a  Yeah... \u000a  Okay, so what shape went the farthest for you guys?\u000a  Um, the cylinder.\u000a  The cylinder, so was your prediction correct? Was yours? Was yours?\u000a  Mm, no.\u000a  What shape did you predict?\u000a  Um, the sphere.\u000a  Sphere, but the cylinder went the farthest, so were you right? No, so did you circle the little X on the bottom? And then you can do your picture. Was your prediction correct, Brian? Okay, so circle the check mark and draw your picture, and then you guys can copy the graph from the board on the back, so you can show your parents what happened. Good work team!  All right, so this team's all set? Okay, so which one went the furthest for this team?\u000a  The sphere.\u000a  The sphere, okay, so was your prediction right, Cecilia?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay, was yours right, Brooke? So, does it matter if you got it right? Not at all. Alright, so then draw your observations, draw what happened, and then you can draw the graph on the back. \u000a  Now we have to draw the graph on the back.\u000a

V Okay, would the person who is currently writing, please stand up?  \u000a Alright, nice and loud. What did you guys put? And why?\u000a Nicholas Carnatkey created the perfect tangent of calculating all the key transient effects on the core to predict, to create the perfect amount of work.\u000a Okay, very good. John, nice and loud.\u000a Marie Curie.\u000a Okay.\u000a Discovered that radiation...\u000a Okay. What about you guys? \u000a Alright. Two claps for these neighbors. \u000a Sit down. Pass the board one person.\u000a What would be, this is an opinion question, what do you think would be the result, if scientists didn't communicate their findings to the community at large? Go! \u000a Do we need to write this down on the board?\u000a Just give a bullet sentence. \u000a Do we have to pick a scientist for this one? To prove it?\u000a Nope. This is just an opinion. Just give me, like, a one word bullet, would be fine.  Okay. Pass the board one person. And would that person please stand up? Troy, what did you guys have?\u000a There would be multiple theories on how things worked. Society would be stagnant and Newton's hypothesis...\u000a Newton was actually asked by a college of scientists about the thoughts of gravity and stuff, and he didn't think it was important. So when he found out, a few months before that, he didn't publish it, until they asked him about it, and then he republished to them, so they could hang out with everybody else.\u000a Okay. Excellent. What do you guys have?\u000a There would be no uniform units, therefore there would be no real way to judge one's discovery, and you couldn't really bounce one idea off another.\u000a Okay. What'd you guys have?\u000a We said that we wouldn't have the technology that we have today because scientists tend to go off of what other scientists have done. Because I know that Celsius went off of Newton's ideas of how the poles were flat, and so he went on an expedition and found out that they were.\u000a Okay. Very good. Alright. Two claps for all our neighbors.  Pass the board one person. Okay. I like this one. If you could interview any of the scientists that we've looked at today, who would it be and what one question, would you be sure to ask? Okay. Go!   Okay. Stop right there. Pass the board one person. Please stand up. Please stand up. Who's going from this group?\u000a Andy.\u000a Super. Okay. Nice and loud. Let's use active listening. John, who would you guys pick and what question would you ask?\u000a Marie Curie.  I said it right.\u000a And what question would you ask, dear?\u000a If she got any oppression from the male scientists.\u000a Okay. The oppression from the male scientists. I like it. What about you guys?\u000a We would ask Thomas Edison, "What inspired you to create the phonograph?"\u000a Excellent. Okay. Back there. Who would you pick and what?\u000a We were also going to ask Thomas Edison to see how other people felt about his invention of light bulbs.\u000a Of the light bulb, specifically. Okay. Brandon?\u000a We had Albert Einstein and our question would be, how did he come up with all his theories, if he couldn't pass high school math?\u000a Okay. What'd you guys put?\u000a We picked Oppenheimer and we would ask why he went into this? If he realized what he actually made?\u000a You probably can't see it, but they have written on the board, "The Manhattan Project." Okay. Very good. And you guys?\u000a Oppenheimer. What his thoughts were of the morality of the atomic bomb.\u000a Okay. This is a really great segway to what we're going to do next. Big claps for all these guys.  Please move into your catwalk formation. Find a partner. Go! In ten. Without the boards! Just yourself. Just your bodies! Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Oh, we have a partner whose hand is up. Four. Looks like, there we go. Three. Two. One. Be sure to, oh, we need a real quick hands up, don't we? Hand ripple! Establish who your partner is.  Wow! That was emphatic! Okay! Be sure you're using active listening, because I will quiz you. Here's your question: "How are scientists affected by social issues?" Social issues going on in our culture. How does that affect what scientists can and can't do, or what they think? The person who woke up the earliest will answer this question and then stand back to back. Go!  When you're done, stand back to back! Okay. Face me. Since this one is kind of a shifting gears one, I want to let you volunteer. Did anybody have a really good answer that their partner gave? Yeah?\u000a Interference from the church.\u000a Okay. Definitely a social issue.\u000a If they don't have their research believed, they could not receive funding, or just get shunned, basically. If it disagrees with what the society basically believes in.\u000a Okay. So, you could be shunned, you could risk your political or your religious beliefs. Em?\u000a Problems with morality, like testing on animals.\u000a Okay. Did you guys want to add something down there?\u000a No.\u000a No? You're good?\u000a They said what we said, basically.\u000a Okay. This question is for the other partner. "Why do you think scientists try to understand the natural world?" Think for a few seconds. "Why do scientists try to understand the natural world?"  Okay. Give your answer, then stand back to back. Go!  Okay. Face me. I'm going to let you guys volunteer on this one, too. Who had a partner with a really good answer? Yeah?\u000a It's just human nature to question things.\u000a Okay. Very good. Since we got the bigger brain with all the cool parts to it. We just question. Okay. What'd you guys have?\u000a Because they're extremely curious on how things work and why certain things do what they do.\u000a Okay. So we're very curious creatures.\u000a How to make things in everyday life easier?\u000a Ooooh! That segways to my next question. Split apart! Brody, take the catwalk. Logan, take the catwalk. Hey, you guys were my first ones last time, too. Aw, such love!\u000a I was the first one last time.\u000a Were you?\u000a Yeah!\u000a Oh, I just remember those two catwalking together. Okay. Shift us down two! Super. Shift down two. And a real quick hand ripple to establish your partner. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Super! Okay. The person who has ordered the most ID badges this year is going to answer the following question. Shh!! Here's your question. Five. Four. Three. Two. Thank you. Here's your question. "What motivation is there to develop technology to meet human needs?" What motivation do scientists have to create technology that meets human needs? Think about it. Go!  Okay. Split apart. I'm just going to randomly popcorn on this one. Brandon, what'd you guys say?\u000a We came up with, make life easier.\u000a Okay. To make life easier. Alright. What's something you guys said?\u000a Money and power.\u000a Money and power. Interesting. What's something you guys said?\u000a To decrease death. Like, medical science.\u000a Okay. So, let people live longer? Probably also live more quality lives? Excellent! Okay. Take the catwalk. Take the catwalk. Shift down two partners once she gets down there. Shift down two. Super! And a quick hands up! Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Uh oh! There we go. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Now, everybody, take three steps that way. One. Two. Three. Super! Okay. This time, the person with the longest hair is going to answer the question. "What evidence can you cite from today's scientists that we've discussed, where something microscopic, something you can't see, was being sensed or manipulated?" What is an example of the scientists we learned today, hold on, just one sec. What is an example of something the scientists we learned about today, hold on, hold on, hold on. I had a request to restate the question. "What is an example from the scientists we learned about today, using, sensing or manipulating something that is microscopic or can't be seen?" Okay? Now go.  We certainly cannot see that. Except on the macroscopic level, we can see the results of it.  Brandon decided to use a lifeline called phone a poster. So, Brandon, what was your answer?\u000a I found on, Thomas Edison found radio waves.\u000a Okay. Very good. Face me, please. Emily, what's something you guys talked about?\u000a Marie Curie found radiation from atoms.\u000a Okay. Very good. Erin, what's something you guys talked about? \u000a Okay. Very good. Take the catwalk. Take the catwalk. On the catwalk. Alright. PG! PG! PG! Thank you!  Scooch down. And, hands up! Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Super! Okay. The person, whose last digit, in their address, is the lowest, is going to answer this question.  Okay. Here is your question. We talked a second ago about the fact that scientists are naturally curious about our natural world, but many scientists have learned to manipulate our natural world. "What is your opinion of scientists manipulating, using for our benefit, our natural world?" Okay. Go.  Okay. Face me! Nice and loud so everyone can hear. Brian, what did your group discuss?\u000a We thought it all depended on humanism. How they thought the humanism in relation to all the other creatures of the world, that they feel like they're higher than all the other creatures, then they can do what they want to the natural world.\u000a Okay. So, as long as it's being used for good.\u000a I guess.\u000a Okay. With the benefit of humans or the world in general? Kind of a socialist view?\u000a The world.\u000a In general. Okay. John, what did you guys say?\u000a Yeah, what did we say?\u000a Pretty much the same thing.\u000a The same thing, pretty much.\u000a Okay. So, are you, specifically, looking at human needs or more, global?\u000a Human.\u000a Okay. What about you guys? What did you partnership talk about?\u000a That it was okay to a point. There was a point when you should not manipulate the natural world. Like, taking a dolphin from one ocean and moving it to another.\u000a Okay. So, who should decide what those points are?\u000a I don't know.\u000a Okay. Alright. That segways us to the next question. "If you were..." Let's see, let's do this. The person with the most buttons on is going to answer this question.  Okay. "If you were the scientific consultant to President Barack Obama, what percentage of our National Budget, should be spent on science, and why?" Justify that amount. Go! It's a percentage. So, we're not talking a dollar amount. What percentage?  Well, it doesn't really matter. Do you think half of our budget? Do you think a third of our budget? You think a quarter of our budget?  I don't know. You could delineate that. Okay. I could tell by looking at you guys, that we've got a couple of folks that feel kind of passionately about this, so spread back apart and face me. What did you guys say?\u000a Well, I said that 15% is a good amount because then, it puts enough money forward to get going and leaves money for other things that we need.\u000a Okay. Now you guys had a very specific take on it. What did you guys talk about?\u000a We talked about if medical, if the percentage was accounting for medical sciences, as well, as it should and, if it is, then the percentage should be increased to help.\u000a Like 50 to 60%, if medical is included.\u000a Okay. So, we have to look at the different kinds of research. Are we just studying stuff to study stuff? Are we developing a technology that will help human need? Are we looking at medical? Alright. Very good. Take the catwalk. Take the catwalk. On the catwalk. They do their little turns on the catwalk. On the catwalk. Okay. Of the science, of the person...\u000a We haven't scooted.\u000a Oh, scoot down. I'm out of order. Thank you. Scoot down. I got so excited about the questions. Scoot down. Scoot down. We will! Okay. Here we go. We're creatures of habit sometimes. Hands up, real fast. Make sure you've got the right partner. Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. There we go. Okay. The person, whose third, no. The person whose last digit in their cell phone number is the highest.\u000a

V What were you saying, Joe?\u000a I said young people definitely benefit our society overall more than old people in the country.\u000a Why?\u000a Just because they can--\u000a Progress.\u000a Contribute more. Yeah. Like they can work and they can help our industry grow and provide opportunities for more people.\u000a Yeah, they're a lot more active compared to old people more, who just is gonna basically sit at home.\u000a I mean if we look at like the current political situation in countries that are rebelling, the rebellion is completely composed of the youth.\u000a Yeah.\u000a If we look at the political situation in America, like Obama's election, was pretty much the 18 to 21 year-old vote. It's just like clearly, they're like better at affecting social change.\u000a In this time period that we're discussing, why would you want the youth to come?\u000a Well because this is like the start of all social change in the union, and I want young people to bring a youthful energy, and determination, and some sort of hope about the country that they're moving to, and that all, my union in here.\u000a  They're gonna progress, they're gonna like technology, and they're gonna invent stuff.\u000a So you're onboard with the--\u000a I'm just saying we still need more money. They're going to be working and they're going to be taking money out of our economy because they're gonna want to pledge. How much are they gonna spend? Like we need old people to spend a lot, like rich people to spend.\u000a  But we need workers.\u000a Yeah, no, so it's like--\u000a We need workers, old people cannot work.\u000a  We need a combination. If only get young people--\u000a If we look at this list of people that we can bring into the country that we were supposed to look at to begin with, the old people on this list aren't that rich.\u000a Yeah, but there's\u000a  The bottom line is\u000a Gonna be more than just the old people there. the old people other countries--\u000a But right now we're focusing on that.\u000a they're going to be moving and they're rich, who would move here? Why would they move to the "Land of Opportunity," if they don't need opportunities? I didn't mean to say that! \u000a That's honesty! Okay.\u000a Yeah but, I mean, I see that.\u000a It seems like the majority, did the majority rule on that? Because I guess, who was against having younger people come in? I know Matt was. Was Matt the only one who wanted older people to come in? Ok, and you were--\u000a  Also--\u000a  I'm a loner.\u000a You just went with the consensus?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, good. -  Another point, another point! Also, old people coming from another country just to spend the rest of their life, aren't necessarily going to be all that interested in America\u000a Okay.\u000a as a country.\u000a And wait, and also--\u000a They're not going to vote, they're not going to, you know, try to participate in the country itself so they're just here to die in comfort? \u000a Okay, go ahead Darvel.\u000a On the way, it's already tough enough to come across the sea to get to the United States, because so many people died on the way getting there, so they might die on the way getting there.\u000a So don't even consider them to begin with?\u000a Right.\u000a Or if they're sick, they can't come into the country, anyway. Like, we're not going to let people who have cholera into our country, because then it'll start spreading here, so ...\u000a You said "colema" or "column?"\u000a  Isn't that more in--\u000a Cholera.\u000a  That's like--\u000a Okay, I was like, what?\u000a What else did you guys have on your cards? What about religion? Does religion matter?\u000a  No.\u000a I don't think it did.\u000a No, no.\u000a That's one thing we, I think we all could agree on.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Oh, everybody--\u000a What about the nativists?\u000a What about the nativists? Darvel, you were okay with the religious freedom happening in this group? Well, I mean, it's kind of like on the edge of the--\u000a He's conformed.\u000a But I  because most of the time, it's Christianity in the United States, so...\u000a Also, majority rule.\u000a Yeah, majority rules.\u000a USA! USA! \u000a Okay, so who did you guys decide to, wait, was that the end of your criteria, or?\u000a No, we had-- -  There's still reasons for coming, race, and knowledge of English, previous jobs, and--\u000a Oh, what'd you guys say for English? What'd you guys say?\u000a They have to know English.\u000a Yeah, we said they had to know.\u000a Basic English, at least.\u000a At least a little bit. They have to know some of it.\u000a Or--\u000a Enough to, you know, find out where the bathroom is.\u000a Really?\u000a Or enough to like communicate--\u000a Or have the ability to learn it.\u000a With other people who may not know English that well.\u000a And Boss, you were okay?\u000a I mean I feel like I'm one of the only ones who disagreed with that, because like being a boss, like I have connections like in every part of my city, and every community, and communities are often like separated by race, so--\u000a By race and?\u000a  And language.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a So, maybe different communities wouldn't have trouble communicating if they only knew one language.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a But being a boss, with my connections, I could definitely like, I could make it so that they could communicate, and I can get them what they need, help them out.\u000a Okay.\u000a I don't think now English is a necessity.\u000a Well you wouldn't--\u000a I think it's pretty, I mean how are people supposed to communicate? And it's just going to make life miserable for the people who are trying to make it. Because I mean, overall the majority speaks English.\u000a But we do have immigrants in this country right now that speak different languages, so they could just--\u000a They're getting by, though.\u000a Right, right.\u000a I don't know if \u000a You should know them, working in factories, you should know a lot of these people.\u000a Yeah, but-- -  You might even know someone--\u000a When I think of like different languages, I think of like the Tower of Bavel, or Babel, it's like in the Bible story, where like everybody spoke different languages, and then the tower collapsed. So like, if everybody speaks different languages, we can't get work done productively, because we don't know what each other want. Like if we say, "Yo, go make this type," I don't know, just, "Do this job," and then they do something else, you need communication.\u000a Darvel, what do you think about the language piece?\u000a Well, I think that speaking English is basically, it's a necessity. I mean, obviously, you would want workers to come in, because he just wants money. He doesn't really think communication is that important, but as a nativist, I believe that it is.\u000a Why? What will happen if we let a lot of people come into the country with different languages, maybe be different races, different ethnicities? What will happen to the country if we let those people in?\u000a I mean, that could create like conflict between the work, because like Matt said, they really wouldn't know what to do while they're working. Also, that could change the patriotism of the country, as well.\u000a But will they know why they're working?\u000a Not really.\u000a So people who don't speak English don't know why they're doing a specific job?\u000a Well, probably, yeah. I mean, they know that they're doing a job to get money.\u000a Right, so does English really matter? I'm just asking.\u000a I mean, they're not gonna really--\u000a X, you wouldn't care if they spoke English, because if they didn't speak English, it might make it easier to exploit them.\u000a I somewhat care. Because they have to collaborate with the people they're working with to get the job done.\u000a The way I see it is, they can come into the country with a, you know, as long as they have the mindset of, "I should probably learn English to succeed in this country," then I think it's a good idea. Because if you're going to be immersed in a language, you're going to be able to learn it eventually, so I mean as long as they try to learn English, or try to know basic English, I think they should \u000a I mean, I think I agree to Darvel. Like if I was a nativist, I'm not saying I am, but if I was a nativist, I wouldn't want hoards of people who don't speak English coming, because I mean it's like, America's pure, we've got everybody speaks English, like we don't want--\u000a But does everybody really speak English right now?\u000a Not now, I'm saying--\u000a No, not right now in 2011, but in our age that we're discussing--\u000a  If I was a nativist in my--\u000a Even then, right?\u000a In my like Ideal world, you would want everybody to like speak English.\u000a Okay.\u000a The whole world should speak English!\u000a Oh, goodness! Yeah, that's what a nativist would say.\u000a I went with the English speakers, because like to properly rebel and have a voice, communication is vital, and I think that people who aren't speaking English won't be interested in what I have to say, can't even understand what I'm saying, so--\u000a Okay, well you guys decide, and talk about who you guys are letting into the country specifically, okay?\u000a Yeah.\u000a All right, thanks guys.\u000a Oh, we already did.\u000a  Education's not really that important to me, though.\u000a I think it's really important.\u000a Dude, it's saying that a lot of these people going into this country aren't educated to begin with.\u000a Well, education like-- -  You would want educated people.\u000a As a non-union worker, like I don't care about education. I just want to keep my job, and I want like union workers to get out of the country.\u000a And as a union worker, I want educated immigrants, because then they would stand up for themselves, and like change factory conditions.\u000a Me, being a tycoon, I just want people to work for me. I mean, they can come to this country, they can live the American way, I'll supply them with a job--\u000a What's the American way?\u000a American way is to--\u000a Well but you're not giving them any money.\u000a Wait, wait, wait, what's the American way?\u000a  2.5 kids--\u000a We are, actually.\u000a 2.5 kids, white picket fence.\u000a  Dog!\u000a Well that's the American, is that the American way now or then? We're talking about then.\u000a  Labrador!\u000a Basically, the American way is\u000a I want them to be doing better than the country they were previously in.\u000a Okay.\u000a That's my concern.\u000a Well, but they came here to like succeed, and you're giving them like two cents an hour.\u000a I mean, for me with education though, it's not that big of a deal, because then again, if they're coming to America, they're going to have to learn our customs and our way, and with them being uneducated, that's easier for us to mold them into society, and opposed to like we can mold their thoughts into like correct candidates to vote for, and stuff like that!\u000a But this is supposed to be like a free country, and they came over here because we like grant that, and we're just like manipulating them.\u000a Yeah, but like basically, the only people I want in the country are like people that are going to give me jobs. Like people who are kind of like--\u000a Who are those people?\u000a Kind of like sketchy people, kind of, because like--\u000a You want sketchy people to come into your country?\u000a Well, sketchy people are about to give me jobs, because like sketchy people are about to like--\u000a What do you mean by sketchy? What does sketchy mean?\u000a When you're saying sketchy, do you mean poor, or like--\u000a Nah, I mean like people that are like rich and stuff, and they'll like have a business and whatever, but like--\u000a They're corrupt a little?\u000a Yeah, they're a little corrupt, so they won't like hire union workers, and they'll keep their people ununionized so I can come in and take the work, make that cash. Know what I'm saying?\u000a Oh, okay. So you want it that people will have money when they come into the country, but not be on the side of unions--\u000a Exactly.\u000a So that they will--\u000a They'll give me jobs.\u000a They will, okay, they'll hire non-union workers.\u000a They're not people that are going to be entering the workforce, they're people that are going to be like already kind of upper, you know what I mean?\u000a Okay, so you want people with money coming into the country?\u000a Yeah, exactly.\u000a Okay. Did you guys decide on a criteria already--\u000a Yup.\u000a Or are you discussing a criteria?\u000a We have a criteria.\u000a This is our criteria, pretty much.\u000a Okay, what's your criteria?\u000a We said non-educated, which some of us don't agree with.\u000a Who didn't agree with it?\u000a I don't agree with that.\u000a  Why?\u000a Because--\u000a  I did not agree with it.\u000a America is the land of education. Everybody needs an education. You can't come here--\u000a Well, but at this time, remember education is not like going to school. It's more of knowing a skill or a trade.\u000a It's like street smarts, almost.\u000a Well, if they don't know anything, then they can work.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay.\u000a And we decided on that--\u000a Do people really need to know a lot, though, to work in these factories?\u000a No, but like--\u000a  No, my business is to teach them how to use these machines.\u000a  We don't want them to be taken advantage of.\u000a I mean, but at the same time, I don't really see the importance of education if they don't come with like money or some type of, like I don't know, some type of prior knowledge with like succeeding in America. Because you may know, you know how to read 100 books, but that doesn't help you like start a business or something like that.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah, but not like that kind of education. Like, education enough where they know like that two cents an hour is not okay. Like so they can stand up for themselves, and like be able to like negotiate with you.\u000a Why is that not okay? I mean, everyone has to get paid. Everyone gets paid that same amount.\u000a Yeah, but they're living in like cramped shacks and like poor conditions.\u000a I mean, that's in your opinion. A house is a house.\u000a Yeah, and then look at where they're coming from. They're coming from religious persecution, they're coming from these governments that are collapsing, these war-stricken countries--\u000a Exactly, and the government--\u000a I think it's better to work in a factory, earn some wage--\u000a Yeah, but how much are you earning compared to them?\u000a Eat or have necessities in life.\u000a I mean, but there's also government support, too. That's where I come in. I set them up with a place to stay, stuff like that, you know. That's what government's here for is support of people that come in here. So it's best when they're not educated, it's best when they don't have money, because that makes it easier for them to get help, and that's what we're here to do is to help people.\u000a But then they're relying on you and they don't know what to do with themselves, like when you--\u000a They're relying on him, but then he lets them rely on themselves, so they come in, rely on him, and then he kind of sends them, like--\u000a How?\u000a Helps them out.\u000a How does he keep people from relying on him?\u000a Because then, all right, so I can help them decide for who to vote for in some type of election that can help them with their lives. Like if there's a politician voting for labor laws, I can help them. If I'm with that politician, I can, "Yo, this is the guy you want to vote for," "This is the guy that will help you."\u000a That's like brainwashing, though, they like have a right to think for themselves.\u000a Honey, this is America.\u000a Exactly.\u000a Exactly! Exactly!\u000a So you're saying that nobody should campaign, ever? You're saying campaigning is brainwashing?\u000a No, you could campaign, but you don't--\u000a Exactly, he's just campaigning!\u000a Can I just say something?\u000a No, but he's like getting them all to agree with him.\u000a Okay, if you think about it this way, you can really have people from all spectrums of money-wise, like from all kinds of economic backgrounds. You can have the more rich people come in, sorry, the education backgrounds. The more educated people are going to come in. No matter what, they're going to help our country more than hurt it. Then for me, I can supply the people who have gotten a lesser education, and I can give them a job, I can start them off in life, and maybe they can go to the library and learn themselves.\u000a Why don't you better their working conditions, then, if you like are "helping" them?\u000a Because I mean, still, this is much better.\u000a No, because they like die in those factories.\u000a It's better than being killed by their previous governments.\u000a  Wait, have we decided--\u000a No, it's not! It's not the same thing.\u000a Have you guys already decided on this piece already?\u000a Yeah, we have like our set laws, we just have disagreements about that.\u000a You guys have disagreements? So you guys were able to a consensus on them?\u000a Yeah, well we kind of voted on it. We decided that they have to be non-educated, come with some sort of money. Their religion and race doesn't matter. Come with a family--\u000a

V Okay, so for social needs, we said that their social needs are being met because they... \u000a They look like the slave traders can talk to each other because they speak the same language, but the slaves don't, so their social needs with each other aren't.\u000a So you feel your social needs are being met?\u000a Yeah.\u000a And how so?\u000a Because our person can talk to...\u000a 'Cause you have people to talk to, don't you?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Anybody agree with that?\u000a I agree, because our person--\u000a You. I am. You're that person. Don't say my person, 'cause that's you.\u000a I can talk to other people.\u000a So, you do have some social interaction? So, there's some disagreement there as social needs are being met or not.\u000a No hands, Nita, jump in.\u000a We cannot \u000a So your social needs are not being met?\u000a Yes, our social needs are not being met because we...\u000a They do not understand each other meaning, like, deaf? Or they cannot talk?\u000a So how does that make you feel? Go ahead and talk about your emotional needs now being met or not being met.\u000a Our emotional needs are not being met right now.\u000a I think I disagree. I think ours are kind of being met.\u000a I agree with Lauren's. Ours are being met because they're more happy that they're gonna get a lot of money.\u000a You're the person.\u000a But our person is kinda serious...\u000a like he doesn't really want... \u000a So as far as what Nita's already talked about? Emotionally? So are your emotional needs being met?\u000a He looks angry.\u000a You feel safe, you're good to go.\u000a Yeah, 'cause we know we're--\u000a She's like, I don't really want to go, but...\u000a They want the money.\u000a But we want money. We want all the money. Well, it's the physical needs anyway. Ours--\u000a Ours are not being met.\u000a Ours are being met 'cause we get weapons and everything, all good food.\u000a I agree. And ours are also being met.\u000a You don't want to mess with them.\u000a Yeah.\u000a I disagree with both of you guys because ours are not being met at all.\u000a Definitely not. We are, like--\u000a We're starving.\u000a Starving.\u000a My needs are not being met if I'm Ashley, because I'm scrunched together, I'm uncomfortable. My physical needs aren't being met because it's crowded and my muscles ache. Does anyone agree with that? That their physical needs are not being met?\u000a I agree that Ashley's physical needs aren't being met because they are scrunched together and it looks like they're in chains and they don't have much--\u000a  Are your physical needs being met?\u000a Yes.\u000a Our physical needs are being met because-- \u000a I disagree with you because I think you have space.\u000a Our physical needs are being met. We're not, like... \u000a You're in good shape? \u000a With your physical needs being met how does that link to emotional and social needs? How do those kind of all go together? Talk about how those all go together overall and how does that make you feel, based on this picture. You're that person, so use first-person point of view, and discuss how those are all intertwined. And then add to your conversation, as far as I know, some of you did the bottom two as far as not-- These are what are being met and these are not being met. So make sure you cover those two, okay? How they all intertwine or if they do. And then you can discuss these bottom questions, too. Even if you didn't get to them with your partner, jump in now with each other. I'll be right back.\u000a Alright, so...  My emotional needs are being met. I'm earning the money that I should be and I feel confident... \u000a All of our emotional needs, all of our needs are being met. \u000a Why are the clothes taken off and why are the--? Just in case\u000a Emotional needs are not\u000a they do jump overboard?\u000a being met. It looks like they're sad because, because we look depressed. And you can just tell it by the faces and what they look like. Our faces and their-- and our body language. And there was-- and we're scared because we see the weapons and we don't know what they're gonna do with it to us.\u000a So think about the cause and  effect of that.\u000a Our emotional kinda was being met.\u000a Are the people standing up--\u000a No.\u000a But how are they not chained?\u000a Still all of our emotional needs are being met.\u000a They're running away.\u000a They don't look worried, they look kind of like they're looking at the scenery kind of.\u000a They look calm.\u000a In their expression they look calm, yeah. They don't look worried or anything.\u000a These people, but the people that are sitting down... \u000a I disagree with Alan, 'cause they look calm and confident.\u000a I kinda disagree with that because they look like-- That's why they're all facing different directions. They're watching for anything suspicious.  They're all looking in different directions.\u000a They aren't smiling like they're looking at beautiful scenery.\u000a There's like little sections in between, so like Grayson said, if they do jump overboard they don't all fall over and tip the boat.\u000a Do you think these people are all in one group? No, let me rewind and say my question again. Do you feel that these people all everybody in this boat was represented by a perspective from your discussion you just had? Do you understand my question? I'm not saying it very well. Were roles of all these people in the boat given to at least somebody in this group?\u000a Yeah.\u000a You think so? How were the roles different?\u000a I think there's bosses and then there was slaves. Like slave traders and them.\u000a Kind of serious, like they just got their reward, and these people, they look kind of like chained--\u000a I don't think they're running away.\u000a I think they're running away.\u000a I think they're going to a bigger boat, 'cause these people look like--\u000a I think they're like--\u000a That's not the full canoe.\u000a And they're just taking the slaves to the big boat.\u000a So let me say my question again. Let me say my question again.\u000a Why would slaves take slaves?\u000a They're slave traders.\u000a They're not slaves.\u000a How do you know they could be slaves or they could be slave traders?\u000a Let me say my question again. I want you to think about your role and what was just said. Do you think that all roles that I gave this group were, I'm sorry, are on this picture?\u000a No.\u000a Oh, you're changing your mind? Discuss that. At first you said yes. Discuss that, why maybe not all the roles that I gave you were on this picture. No, do not say your role yet. Ladies and gentlemen, we have about one minute.\u000a I think that they are people in the tribe and they're giving their slaves as slaves.\u000a You know how we were doing that worksheet, the graphic organizer? It said that most of the time, they would just trade other villages for their slaves and take those ones.\u000a Well, I think--\u000a 'Cause they could still have their own slaves.\u000a I think this is a slave trader... well, not really like a slave trader, but like\u000a 'Cause the slave traders\u000a a slave boss kind of?\u000a were from England, so I think they'd have white skin.\u000a I think they're with the other people--\u000a But remember African-Americans were also slave traders.\u000a Because they're not chained and they're standing and the other people, like slaves, are all tucked together and depressed.\u000a I think that... some European traders tried to persuade other slave people to say, like "go get your crime people, go get your crime people..."\u000a Slaves.\u000a Yeah, "your slaves "in your own tribe, and then we'll trade you--"\u000a Gold.\u000a A bag of tobacco.\u000a And those helped capture... So even though they don't have white skin, they might be slave traders and they give, like, \u000a So we have two different maybe perspectives of slave traders, is that what I'm hearing you say? One being?\u000a They could have also been threatened to work.\u000a Europeans.\u000a Hold that thought, David. One being?\u000a Europeans and one being African.\u000a Well not really African-American...\u000a 'Cause in the book it said that the African slaves, not the European slaves, but the African slaves, their slaves were kinda like maids.\u000a So I want you to think about the role that you were given. And I asked you to look at that picture from that perspective. Is it possible that that specific role I gave you has many different perspectives itself?\u000a Yes.\u000a Alright. I want you to wrap up your conversation if you have anything else to add, and then we're gonna continue tomorrow.\u000a You're not gonna tell?\u000a Not yet, no. I changed my mind. You think you know. You think you know.\u000a We still have the cards.\u000a Aw, rats.\u000a They did it.\u000a

V  Okay, you guys based on the answer tickets that we took yesterday, what we realized, or what I realized, is that there's still confusion on going from the general to factor. General to vertex, or vice versa on any of those three particular forms. Also, another objective we're gonna do is we're gonna figure out- determine why each form is important. So, the first thing I want you guys to do is, I want you guys to look at number one on that task card. Can someone read it out loud?\u000a  I will.\u000a  Yeah, Drew.\u000a  The Angry Bird was blasted through a slingshot at the initial height of 45 meters. The bird's initial velocity was 14.7 meters per second. Write an equation that gives the height of the Angry Bird as a function of time.\u000a  Okay, so what I need you guys to do is I need you guys to write that equation on the white board.\u000a \u000a  Okay, so now I want people to put it up on the board. Okay.  Okay, so can you guys look around to each other too, I know you guys are gonna want to,  like, show everybody what people are getting.\u000a  Yay...Cool...\u000a  Okay, guys, these are the four things, or the three things that I saw. Okay, so right here. So, if you notice a lot of you guys, you guys had the first one. Negative four point nine 'x' squared plus 14.7 'x' plus 49. Can someone tell me in words how you were able to figure that out?\u000a You just did it.\u000a What was the question?\u000a  So, can someone tell me how, like, relate this general formula to the story. Since you've read already, I wants someone else to speak. So who? Okay, Jamilah, can you explain how you were able to get this equation?\u000a So, the height is c, and the original equation is a 'x' squared, plus b 'x', plus c. And so the initial height is b, which is the y intercept. And then b is the initial velocity? And then negative four point nine is just the random number that they chose.\u000a  So, you guys, is it random?\u000a No.\u000a It's the scale factor.\u000a  Is there any other terminology for that?\u000a It's the starting point.\u000a  Hey guys, do you think it's the starting point? Is it the starting point? Or, what else...?\u000a It's gravity.\u000a  So wait, what does this negative four point nine mean?\u000a That's the constant. Remember, it's gravity.\u000a  So, I heard...\u000a Scale factor?\u000a  Okay, scale factor, but relatively to your projectile motion, what is it?\u000a Acceleration?\u000a  Acceleration. So you guys....\u000a  It's acceleration. So, right now, what I want you guys to do... Oh, actually once again, right here- here are different forms of an equation that I saw. So, right here what do you think? Can someone tell me what's wrong with this particular one?\u000a They don't have a squared and they don't have an 'x' after the 4.2 \u000a Okay, so, Ravelle, what's the problem with this one?\u000a There's no 'y' intercept or... .\u000a  So, once again, I still notice, now I want to go back to the original equation. Okay, someone tell me in words. Ah, Jamilah, she did a fantastic job explaining relatively to the a 'x' squared, plus b 'x', plus c, but according to the story, can someone refer to the story back to the general equation?\u000a Can you rephrase the question?\u000a  Yes. How are we able to get 14.7 here? How did we get 49 here? How do you know what stuff to use?\u000a The 49 is the initial height in meters, so that one's gonna be your 'y' intercept, And 14.7 is the initial velocity, and the initial velocity is always 'b' so... \u000a  Awesome. So, now what I want you guys to do is, I want you to go to number two. So, I want you to put that on the white board.\u000a Can I read it again?\u000a  Well, actually, no. Let's have, Fatima, can you read number two?\u000a  What does the 'x' axis represent in this story? What does the 'y' axis represent in our story?\u000a  Okay, let's do that quickly.\u000a I have a question.\u000a  Yes.\u000a Did 'x', never mind, I'll wait until after this.\u000a  So, let's look around. So, a lot of people are getting what?\u000a 'X' equals time. 'Y' equals height.\u000a  So Markeisha, what was your question?\u000a I was gonna say, could 'x' be distance as well?\u000a  Can 'x' be distance, people?\u000a No.\u000a No. If it wanted to. \u000a  Why not?\u000a Because, it's meters per second, not meters per \u000a  So, does that make sense?\u000a \u000a  All right. So, now what I want you guys to do...  So, so far, let's recap what we've done so far. Can everyone generalize what we've just done in the first couple of questions?\u000a We set up the equation and we figured out our 'x' and y axes, in the general form.\u000a  Okay, right now, what I want you guys to do is, I want you guys to work on number four. Okay, someone read that out loud that hasn't read out loud yet.\u000a I haven't.\u000a  So, Leslie, you want to read? Number four?\u000a  From the equation that you got from question number one, show the steps on how you translate the general form into the factor form.\u000a  Now what I want you guys to do, I want you to turn and talk about the strategies you're planning to use to work out this problem.\u000a \u000a  Okay, you guys, I'm gonna stop class real quick. You guys, I'm gonna stop class real quick.\u000a  Okay, so Mary, can you just ask the question that you just asked me?\u000a She asked me.\u000a  Okay, so one of you guys ask the question that we just talked about. So Markeisha, Jamilah?\u000a Can we use the box to figure it out?\u000a Yeah, you can.\u000a  Why? How? Hang on. Put that back away. So, you guys. So the question is... Okay, so Autumn just asked, can she use the diamond and rectangle method as opposed to  and why?\u000a \u000a  You guys... You guys, let's listen, please. Mary. Sorry.\u000a You figure it out by dividing negative four point nine by all the numbers. So, if you divide negative four point nine 'x' squared, by negative four point nine, you'll get 'x' squared. 14.7 divided by negative four point nine is negative three. And then 49 divided by negative four point nine is negative ten?\u000a  Okay, I'll stop you right there. So, back to what I said. Okay, so the diamond-rectangle method, people. So, when you are doing this, what are you finding?\u000a We're finding the box.\u000a  You're finding the box. So, what are those things outside of the box here? What are they called.\u000a The factors.\u000a  The factors. Okay. Okay, when you're using, it seems like a lot of you guys are using the quadratic formula. What are you trying to find then?\u000a \u000a  All right. So, right now... So, Autumn. So, you have questions on that right? So, later on... So, do you mind just moving over there real quick? Because Leslie said that you got it down. So, you guys, so take two more minutes. We're gonna see both methods.\u000a \u000a So, are you done yet?\u000a No.\u000a \u000a  Okay, you guys stop. Okay, right now,  I'm gonna put this up right here. We're gonna put up the most common mistakes that people tend to do. Okay, so right now, so how many people got negative five and two?\u000a  No...no...no.\u000a  So, what was it?\u000a Negative two .\u000a Oh, okay, I got negative two and five. My bad.\u000a  Okay, so right now. What do you think was the mistake that she did?\u000a She didn't square it.\u000a  She didn't what?\u000a She didn't square. And then she re-fixed it.\u000a  She fixed it?\u000a Yeah, she copied mine.\u000a It's supposed to be negative 14.7.\u000a  Is that what its supposed to be?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  And is that what she's missing?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, guys, so that's one mistake that happens quite a bit. Also, let's look at... Hey, you guys, what form is this right here? What method did they use?\u000a Box and diamond method.\u000a  Box and diamond method, right?\u000a Okay, so, you guys, what do you call these two items right here? What is it missing?\u000a The number at the beginning. The negative four.\u000a  And what is that again? What is the name of the four point nine again? Scale factor or what?\u000a Acceleration!\u000a  Acceleration. So, you guys, if you notice, this is something that tends to be missing also. So, now we will look at...ah...\u000a We have the same thing.\u000a We all have the same thing.  So, same thing, same thing. All right. Okay. So, right now I think we looked at all the common mistakes that people tend... Oh actually,  So, now what I want is... so, how many methods do people use?\u000a Two?\u000a Okay, so tell me one what was one method? What was the method that you used?\u000a Quadratic formula?\u000a Okay, Caleb? What was another method that people used?\u000a The box and diamond.\u000a  The box and diamond, right? So, right now, I want people to explain their thinking. So, what I want you to do is, okay, since... Tiffany, since you said you did the quadratic formula, you're gonna go up and talk about it. Just talk about the process of what you did.\u000a \u000a  How are you gonna explain the process?\u000a  All right. So, the  \u000a Can we do it on this hard board?\u000a  Yeah. Okay. Let's do it on this hard board.\u000a  Make sure you talk to us, okay?\u000a  Okay, while you're writing things down, talk about how you're going through the process.\u000a So, I used the quadratic formula?\u000a  So, what are you doing right now?\u000a I'm writing it.\u000a  Writing what?\u000a The quadratic formula.\u000a  Okay. So you see, instead of me asking, I just want you to explain all the things that you're doing.\u000a Okay.\u000a So, you guys need some visuals... This will be your a, your b, and your c. So, you plug all this into this.\u000a  Okay, so let's  do it.\u000a  I have a question.\u000a  Yes.\u000a  What if the b is already negative?\u000a  That's a good question.\u000a \u000a  So, you guys, while Tiffany is doing the quadratic formula, think about what common mistakes that we just talked about earlier, and what mistakes that she may or may not have.\u000a \u000a

V  I teach in a second and third grade combination class. The students are arranged in grade-level specific table groupings. This allows students to complete any grade-level specific projects together and receive instructions in a manner that's clear to them. I also have a guided reading area. And a independent reading corner. All of the resources the students may need are located around the perimeter of the classroom leaving access to the center of the classroom, the large rug area for all of our class discussions to take place. As well as collaborative group work. Students also have available to them the reading corner area as an area for collaborative group work. They have a listening center where they access books on tape and CD. We have three computer stations where children word process completed writing projects, or they do research on the internet. But complete sentence, okay for that first part. All right, and then someone who's taking turns. So we're clear on the rubric what my expectation is when we walk around. Questions?\u000a If they make a mistake, do you want us to correct their English or ?\u000a You know what, what I think is a nice way to correct someone when they misspeak, and I do this a lot, so you might notice that I restate what someone has said. And that's part of being a good listener. So, being able to recall or restate. Something like, oh, I heard you say, and then you restate it in the way that might be more appropriate. That's a respectful way of being a listener and also a speaker when you're trying to teach and be a role model.\u000a I have a different idea, I think that is.\u000a Okay, so there's another way, "I think that is," excellent. So we're going to just try this out and see how it goes. We're going to try this out again, and practice those cues.\u000a Are we the same number as usual?\u000a Yeah, okay so here we go. We're going to practice. When you get to your pictures, this is what I want you to do. Right now, I have put, I have this image of a whale on, okay can you have a seat? I need everyone sitting next to their partners right now. So what I want you to do is, looking at this picture, I want you to practice right now in your group sharing one or two things that you notice in this picture. What do you see? So I want you to share exactly physical features, and use descriptive language to talk about what you see. Question?  Hold on a second, sweetie, I just called on Jonathan. Just a second. Question? \u000a We're going to describe with our partner. So you're going to need to turn to your partner. Adam what did you?\u000a I don't really understand what that thing in black is.\u000a You know, it's just a shadow. It's a shadow. This one? It's just a shadow on the picture. It just doesn't look very clear the way it came out. It's the shadow on the image, okay? All right, so turn to your partner. When I ring the bell, number ones share first. When I ring the bell, number twos share. When I ring the bell, I'm going to take some of your descriptive language. Sharing what you see.   \u000a Number twos.  \u000a Okay, excellent. So I'm going to pick a stick. I'm going to go fishing in my sticks. And when I call your name I want you to share either what you saw, or what your partner saw, okay? What was the detail that was shared? And I'm going to write it up on this sticky note because I'm modeling now what you're going to do when you get to your stations. Everyone's going to get a stack of sticky notes and you're going to get an opportunity after you share to record some of your ideas of what you see. Number 10, Cesar.  Sorry? You want to ask a question? For a clarifying question?\u000a No, I was just making a comment. Just I don't like it when there's only like one sticky note for everyone. Because then the first group who goes there puts like every single little thing that they see. And it takes up like maybe three-quarters of the whole paper. And then the next group has like .\u000a Okay, so we're going to solve that problem, because each individual gets a sticky note, okay? And then you're going to choose where you're going to put it. All right, so number 10, Cesar.\u000a  Madelaine said that she saw white spots and one on the bottom. And she said an Orca, and she saw a very long tongue and sharp teeth.\u000a  She actually named the animal, which was an Orca. She saw white spots on the bottom. And what was the part about the teeth?\u000a  and a few sharp teeth. \u000a Oh sorry, and then sharp teeth. Okay, so I wrote more than one idea on this sticky note. But what you're going to do is after we do the conversation, after we walk through the stations and see the images and talk about it, then you're going to go back and record one idea on the sticky note. And put it onto the picture. So let's try one more. I'm going to turn it over. So look at the picture, and then I'm going to ring the bell, you're going to share, and I'll pick somebody else to share what they see.     \u000a  Okay, so who's next, number 21, Roberto.\u000a My partner says, oh what I said?\u000a  It can be what you said or what your partner said, whatever you decide. His was good?\u000a I said that I see a pod of Orca whales and their dorsal fins sticking up out of the water.\u000a  That was great. So he has two points, that he sees the pod which is how we refer to,\u000a  A group.\u000a  A group, excellent use of the vocabulary. The Orca whale, so he's named the actual type of whale. And he starts looking at the dorsal fins, which is one of the physical features. Not only of the Orca, but of what?\u000a The humpback doesn't.\u000a The humpback, that's right it doesn't have a dorsal fin. So which ones have the dorsal fin?\u000a All the others ones except for that one. \u000a  There's a couple of other ones as well.\u000a Blue whales don't.\u000a  Blue whales, good, good, good, good, good. Eyes up here. Are there any questions on what I want you to do when you go around to the different stations? Yes, Sarah.\u000a So how many sticky notes are we going to get? Like a couple, four or five?\u000a So, first I'm going to give you a chance to walk around. And then I'm going to come around and I'm going to give you some sticky notes.\u000a  So you're going to let us look at them and then we're going to pick which one we want and put a sticky note on?\u000a Yes, exactly, exactly. \u000a What's this? This one's cool. I see, some baleen, which means it's a baleen whale. And it looks like it has a big mouth. And the baleen looks like it is, some sort of bendy thing. And on the bottom of the baleen it's scary. And it looks like it has a big mouth which probably means it is a very big baleen whale.\u000a I see a baleen whale with a lot of crushed thingies. And a person's touching it. I'm not sure if it's a real whale that's alive. It might just be an exhibit.\u000a No, Jake.\u000a And , so I don't really think this is something that's underwater. \u000a It's part of baleen. It's like a baleen whale, there's baleen, but. \u000a  It looks like a Blue Whale, because it is very big. It also doesn't have any throat looms. and it has just a small bump for it's dorsal . It also looks like it's swimming very close to the top. And that also looks like it's coming up for air. \u000a I see a whale that a man is touching their teeth.\u000a I'm not exactly sure what type of whale this is, but it's a whale.\u000a I see someone touching part of a whale, and it might be part of a baleen . I see a whale and I think it's coming to the surface for a breath because they cannot breathe under water.\u000a I think that that is a baleen whale because it is, it is white and it's a little bit gray. \u000a I see a whale that is going up to the surface of the water, and I believe that it's a beluga whale.\u000a I see the whale. I think it's going to jump out the water, and then dive .\u000a I see a big, gigantic, beluga whale with his skin has a couple like dents and wrinkles.\u000a And it doesn't have a dorsal fin.\u000a

V  I think that Igneous and Metamorphic, they're the least , there are two books that don't use 'em 'cause they're .\u000a  Well my Igneous .\u000a  Yeah, it . Igneous and Metamorphic cool off and react. And only a few particles came off, but I was .\u000a  Yeah, it's just awkward because mine was, boosting most of yours.\u000a  Well yeah.\u000a  When I did my alien, on my first try, it was 42 grade. Then now when I'm measuring it again, it was 22 grade. It .\u000a  Mine never changed, all it did was lost a little bit of it's rice crispies.\u000a  That was mine. But, I feel like Igneous rock,  like, 20.\u000a  Well yeah. 'Cause the weathering does a lot of things to the rock's outside. And--\u000a  Mine was the same as Igneous and metamorphic .\u000a  And so, if I'd shake it... like through weathering, a bunch of rock would fall off.\u000a  I haven't done anything yet. It was three. I can't wait to--\u000a  Oh. \u000a  I have to say, the one with the marshmallows 'cause it's .\u000a  Well for my Sedimentary, it was harder.\u000a  Yeah, mine too.\u000a  What  \u000a  'Cause when I did mine, only one piece of my Sedimentary broke apart, and--\u000a  The Sedimentary--\u000a  My Igneous rock--\u000a  It has, like almost .\u000a  It might be a little inaccurate since these are not real Sedimentary rocks. You have to keep that in mind.\u000a  Well yeah.\u000a  So, but what if they were real Sedimentary? Would we be able to tell what they are?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Obviously.\u000a  Do you know any Sedimentary rocks that looks like a granola bar?\u000a  Yes, I saw them in my yard. They're called a granola ball.\u000a  No.\u000a  That was probably granite, which is an Igneous rock.\u000a  For Jeanie, do we write just how many lasts? 'Cause mine must've had .\u000a  Okay so when I, when I did the blendering, of my Sedimentary, I lost only three grams off of my, Sedimentary rock. So I'm not sure what would happen if I add these two. \u000a  Because of the heat out of the, 'cause if you were to put heat to a rock like our little blue Metamorphic rocks, what would happen was the heat would melt it, and it would give pressure to stick down to the tinfoil.\u000a  Yeah, that's how that happens.  because this is probably the farthest off we have from a little while.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Like last we , and like have you ever heard of a rock that's called  Metamorphic rock?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  It can be greasy.\u000a  Let's talk about why we use the models. Obviously, you're never gonna be so lucky as come across a rock that's like the taffy. Why did we use the Laffy Taffy for our model?\u000a  Because the heat and the pressure, the heat and the pressure would like stick together, but like a Sedimentary rock, .\u000a  We use our fingers to add that heat pressure. We had to simulate it somehow, we couldn't do the actual Earth process in the classroom. Do you agree with that?\u000a  Mm hmm.\u000a  Okay, so you understand why, you understand why we use that material for our model? Okay.\u000a  \u000a  Right, it probably melts. And why did we use the microwave for the Igneous rock?\u000a  Because--\u000a  What were we trying to simulate there? \u000a  From?\u000a  Magma is a really hot substance, and this is what Igneous rocks can form from.\u000a  Could we actually manipulate and touch magma in the classroom?\u000a  No.\u000a  No. Could we work a marshmallow?\u000a  Yep.\u000a  So we understand the connection there. We're trying to use materials, that we can bring into the classroom, but that will still simulate lava, magma, the processes. Okay? So pressure--\u000a  I think it has less effect of all the .\u000a  It had a lesser effect going through the processes of?\u000a  Of both.\u000a  Weathering?\u000a  And erosion.\u000a  And erosion, okay. Now you guys can think about this, if you didn't like the samples and examples up here that I used, you could always do it different. Food material. To make up your own experiment later. Okay?   Let's talk for a moment. Why should we measure again after our rock samples have been through weathering and erosion? Why are we measuring again?\u000a \u000a  Look at your rock samples, do they look the same as what we measured in here?\u000a  No.\u000a  No. What happened?\u000a  You have to measure the difference.\u000a  The difference, and why would there be a difference? What could we do to our rock samples?\u000a  \u000a  Changed dramatically when you did the weathering on them. \u000a  Let's use the same , what did you use when you pre-measured? I would keep it the same. Why would I keep it the same?\u000a  Because it's .\u000a  Can we compare centimeters to inches?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  You can? Think about that, because later when you have to come back and do the difference, how are you gonna do the difference with some centimeters and some inches? \u000a  How can you compare those two measurements?\u000a  \u000a  You're telling me, you wanna go centimeters here, but inches down here.\u000a \u000a  I would keep it the same. They would make it mathematically . \u000a  You working on your difference? Your difference in mass? This your pre-mass?\u000a  \u000a  Explain to me how you got to that.\u000a  Where are the books? They might add on to another sedimentary rock, 'cause it's like never ending.\u000a  For some reason, my Sedimentary and my Igneous rock. They both lost a half inch in length.\u000a  Yeah, mine too.\u000a  In my igneous rock grams, it lost 20 grams and my sedimentary lost 10 grams.\u000a  Mine lost no grams.\u000a  Mine gained grams.\u000a  Your gained grams?\u000a  Yeah, I had 17 grams. I had 17 grams, and then it came back to 21. And this one went up one. Because when this one went up three.\u000a  Maybe you should check that over. 'Cause it weathers and erodes away.\u000a  Well, I'm guessing that most of the bits and pieces of the other people's stuff, went into mine, and made it bigger. 'Cause, it can do that, it can. See? Right there. All around the--\u000a  Oh! I see it!\u000a  See? Other bits and pieces of other people's went into mine, and made mine bigger. \u000a  With mine, a bunch of bits and pieces .\u000a  And mine started to melt.\u000a  Because your observations say it crumbles apart, it's breaking apart and moving.\u000a  \u000a  Okay, what about these gaps here.\u000a  These gaps?\u000a  Yeah, how you gonna do that? \u000a  For some reason, my Igneous rock . \u000a  Into the sample?\u000a  It made it bigger.\u000a  Made it heavier? Did it have more mass after the ? Your protective sleeve's coming off. That's a good possibility, that might throw your measurements off. Did it happen to anything else? Any other sample? Now you're working on a difference in...? You gotta find the difference in length and width, and you're gonna find the difference in mass. That's interesting, you could explain that away right there. Mm hmm, isn't that the one, Igneous, the one you were saying got the strange results? You can talk to me then. \u000a  Well, that's probably how they make the canyons bigger. Maybe because some of the rocks, after rain and the sandstorms, they could just pound together and make a big old rock. So... Okay, so if it erodes off another rock--\u000a  I'm listening, are you talking about real life rocks when they really--erode away Mmhmm.\u000a  And it starts to rain, 'cause a lot of times it's like wind and rain. A lot of times it takes the sand away from the rain, with the rain, and here's another rock, which makes a bigger.\u000a  You're thinking sometimes with real life rocks, you could have actual sediment mixing in with igneous rocks? Right, do you remember how we talked about how igneous can morph back into sedimentary? Those bits and pieces are melding with igneous rock when you have that blend, where igneous is morphing into sedimentary rock, okay? So that would also cause reason for your measurements  I like where you're going with that.  Try to make that connection. You know, Unis was giving me a hard time earlier about how 'metamorphic rock's not made of Laffy Taffy. So how's this go back to rocks in real life'? Think about that. \u000a  Some of our videos that we were watching? About what salts quartz in these two processes. \u000a  You have to let the water go down.\u000a  'Cause the heat inside of it could've frozen. 'Cause they heat over there, we had it kinda . \u000a  Whoa, what's the answer? \u000a  19 grams.\u000a  19.\u000a  --Igneous--  \u000a  Igneous!\u000a  How could you make that? Explain it to your little sister . She's not gonna be able to understand that, she wasn't here. What could you put on your rock cycle diagram?\u000a \u000a  Okay. So you're gonna have .\u000a  This is 17.\u000a  17 for what? Igneous? What about sedimentary? \u000a  Tell me how Sean needs help.\u000a  Um, he needs help with \u000a  Okay.  where he's trying to find the mass of the sedimentary rock.\u000a  What do ya mean?\u000a  No, I was saying that it may have gotten darker.\u000a  Darker, because of the heat.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  A lot of rocks do that.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  But it could be jus the pink.\u000a  Yeah, it could be, I could write down that, it could be pink.\u000a  Yeah, what happened to my  metamorphic rock, is .\u000a  I can \u000a  Yeah that's because of this thing.\u000a   in between our finger and \u000a  Mine, it didn't get darker than mine though. \u000a  So you could add that to what you put in .\u000a  So how would that affect our measurements? How did it affect your width? \u000a  Igneous and sedimentary rock could .\u000a  Now talk to me though, if it's in  \u000a  You wanna know why those are there? Because a lot of rocks don't have protection that doesn't help them. And a lot of kids drop theirs inside their bag, which mixed with the Sedimentary.\u000a  It could .\u000a  And sooner or later if it just stays in there and rolls around, guess what it would do? It would also become a sedimentary.\u000a  It's just like the rocks, it's just like the rocks in life It's more similar to real life. \u000a  Yeah! \u000a  The eroded bits would stick to other rocks.\u000a  So I just added, like bits. \u000a  We have bits and pieces.\u000a  See, if I was to shove this in my bag and just roll it around in all of this, this would also become this, because this isn't on the mat. This would begin to stick. And when you ball it together, it makes it appear coloring to it, that show that it's inside there.\u000a  I think that the igneous and the metamorphic rock,  \u000a  After each sample, ones that were weathering and erosion.\u000a  So you're gonna compare your two measurements-- pre-measurement, post-measurement-- to see if there's a difference for each rock.\u000a  Hmm.\u000a  Hmm.\u000a  Do we have to subtract?\u000a  Do we? What's your key word that could tell you what to do? Difference? \u000a  Go show me, I know you're thinking. You just told me, what key word tells you what to do? \u000a  Where were we? Finding the mass? After we've done the weathering and erosion? Okay, are you gonna get started?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Yes. Jack, are you finished with that scale? Can we use manners, please? Can we use manners? Can you say please pass the balance? \u000a  Talk to me guys, just for a moment, about the differences in those, in your . We've got Ashley's igneous, we talked about that.\u000a  I figured out for the metamorphic that changes did actually happen, because they put the sedimentary, came on to the metamorphic.\u000a  So we can see again, how, just, and it probably had a lot to do with our service and our bag, that's how those pieces of sediment got attached to our metamorphic rock.\u000a  And I think it became darker because the heat  because of the pink.\u000a  And because of the pink?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay, think about in real life sedimentary rock, when those levels, when those layers are smashed together. Okay, don't some of those layers change the color with all that heat and pressure? Okay, that was your metamorphic. Yes Brooke.\u000a  And also, you get the igneous in there, it sticks to it, and you can just put it inside there, cover the layers off, and it actually gets inside the metamorphic.\u000a  So you all noticed how your rock samples are very true to real actual rocks, and how they could combine with one another, and result in a completely different rock. Okay? So, on your next page where you get to make your rock cycle diagram, maybe you could use those observations and those understandings when explaining your outcome. Not the candy rock cycle, the real one.\u000a  \u000a  It says that you could use a diagram, okay? Using your textbook, Level Readers Science Journal, or the rock cycle experiment that we just completed. Anything you want to be able to explain the rock cycle. Okay?\u000a  \u000a  My igneous has gone down just a bit.\u000a

V Okay. What objects or pictures do you see?\u000a I see a flag.\u000a A flag.\u000a  A sign.\u000a The sun.\u000a And the letters.\u000a A sign. Yeah.\u000a And the birds.\u000a There are birds over here.\u000a People carrying bags.\u000a Okay, people carrying bags.\u000a There's a ship.\u000a A ship.\u000a The ladies all have hats.\u000a Okay. The ladies all have hats on. They look like they're dressed to go somewhere, right?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Good. All right.\u000a Do you want us to write it in here?\u000a You can copy it. I have the words spelled up here. We have Uncle Sam. We have a boat.\u000a Do you want us to write it?\u000a I'm going to have it up here. Yeah.\u000a Oh.\u000a We have a flag.\u000a We have this thing. What does this thing look like?\u000a Kind of like a witch.\u000a No. No.\u000a Yeah. It looks kind of like a witch. Something scary anyway, right?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Broccoli.\u000a It looks like broccoli? Okay. Yeah, it does. It's kind of fluffy on top. I agree.\u000a All right.\u000a There are people.\u000a We've got people. We've got birds.\u000a \u000a Mm-hmm. So here are our objects. Uncle Sam, boat, American flag. I wrote scary devil-looking thing. If you want to put witch-looking thing, that's fine.\u000a I'm gonna put both.\u000a Traveling people and birds.\u000a \u000a I put enough blanks for a few objects, but feel free to add more than the number of lines I wrote. All right. Okay. Which of the objects-- whoops. Okay. Which of the objects do you see could be symbols?\u000a  The flag.\u000a All right. This is what I want you to do. Stop. Turn to the person beside you. Beside you, beside you, beside you. See if you can think of-- you already said flag. That's a perfect example. It is one of them. I think four of these are symbols. Not every object is going to be a symbol. So turn and see if you and your partner can come up with any more. \u000a \u000a Each pair can be that.\u000a \u000a Two different. Yeah.\u000a Oh. \u000a All right. What did we come up with?\u000a We came up with the top of his hat thing. It's the same as the flag.\u000a It looks exactly like the flag, okay? So what could Uncle Sam be a symbol of?\u000a  U.S.\u000a Of the United States. Good.\u000a Did you come up with one?\u000a The traveling people.\u000a The traveling people? What do you think they symbolize?\u000a They're from other countries.\u000a Yeah. They symbolize people from other countries. Good. Did you come up with one?\u000a The scary devil-looking thing.\u000a Okay. What is that?\u000a It's clouds in the sky?\u000a Okay. It looks like clouds, but why did the artist draw the clouds as a scary-looking thing?\u000a To get them out?\u000a To scare them?\u000a Or maybe it's the rain. They're scared of storms.\u000a Okay. Who is the devil-looking thing? Who is he going after?\u000a  The people.\u000a The people. What are the people running away from?\u000a From their other countries.\u000a From their other countries. So what could the cloud be a symbol of?\u000a Bad things.\u000a Immigrants?\u000a Yeah. They're the immigrants. What is the cloud?\u000a \u000a Yeah. Their governments from their own countries.\u000a Oh.\u000a Is coming back after them or trying to scare them, anyway. All right? Here we go. We have these four. Uncle Sam, the boat, the American flag, and the devil-looking thing. I didn't do one for the travelers, but you're right. They can symbolize immigrants. Uncle Sam symbolizes America. This is one you didn't say.\u000a I told you.\u000a The ark, this boat here symbolizes what?\u000a  The Bible.\u000a The ark from the bible. Okay. Is anybody familiar with the story of the ark in the bible?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a What did the ark do?\u000a It saved.\u000a It saved Noah, his family, and who else?\u000a Animals.\u000a And the animals.\u000a Oh yeah. Now I remember.\u000a So what do you think this boat's purpose in this picture is? What's the boat going to do?\u000a Save them.\u000a Save. Okay. So knowing that, knowing that this is an ark and knowing that this is America, what do you think? Are these people being stopped or welcomed?\u000a  Welcomed.\u000a Welcomed. And how do we know that?\u000a He's letting them in. He's like, come on, let's go.\u000a But how do we know that he's welcoming them and not telling them to stop?\u000a Because it's the ark.\u000a Because it says ark, okay? And we're connecting what we know about the ark to this picture. That is called an allusion. In English class, you talked about allusion. Allusion is when you refer to something that is famous. Some famous piece of literature. Okay? The flag stands for freedom. The scary devil-looking thing is governments from other countries. Take a second and copy that down. Okay. I'll go on to the next question. How are the words-- How do the words in the cartoon tell you what the symbols mean? Okay? We talked about this already. The U. S. Ark of Refuge are some of the words in the cartoon and they tell us that the boat is a symbol of the United States. Okay? Identify the cartoon's caption. All right. In this cartoon, there is no caption. There is no title at the top or at the bottom, but there are some words that help us understand and that's this sign. The sign says no oppressive taxes, no expensive kings, no compulsory military service. So this is the promise of the United States to the immigrants. To the traveling people. Words or phrases used in the cartoon to identify objects or people in the cartoon. Okay? What words or phrases here can be used to identify?\u000a I was going to say the ark.\u000a Yeah. The Ark of Refuge. And what does it identify?\u000a \u000a The ark.\u000a It identifies the ark as what in this cartoon? What is the ark?\u000a The boat.\u000a But what is it a symbol of?\u000a Welcoming.\u000a Yeah. A symbol of welcoming people, right? Or a symbol of America itself, because once you're in, you're in America. What words or phrases in the cartoon appear to be the most significant? All right? Calling the U.S. a refuge tells us people come here for safety.\u000a \u000a We'll come back to it. And here, the sign says no taxes or oppressive kings. Tell us why people left their countries.\u000a To get good jobs.\u000a Yeah. To get jobs.\u000a To have a better life.\u000a Right. What were they running away from?\u000a From paying taxes.\u000a From paying taxes. From kings. Now, any guesses about what time period people would have been running away from taxes and kings?\u000a 1900s.\u000a 19th Century.\u000a The 19th Century, which would be the periods were very big. Kings were a problem in some places in the world. No oppressing taxes. Even as far back as the revolutions in the 1700s, people were dealing with this, okay? So you can use clues in a cartoon to figure out when the cartoon was written and sometimes things like these signs can help you figure that out. All right? List adjectives in the cartoon and what they mean? What adjectives are in the cartoon? It's on this sign for one thing.\u000a Oh. The kings.\u000a Okay. What did they call the kings?\u000a Wealthy?\u000a What did they call kings? What kind of kings did they have? It's kind of hard to read there. Okay. Here we go. We'll do it this way.\u000a Controlling.\u000a Yeah.\u000a More powerful than others.\u000a Expensive  can't see...\u000a I know, I know. So oppressive means it's controlling. Expensive means they spend too much money.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Compulsory means that you have to do something. Compulsory military service means everybody has to join the army. So some people might be running away from that because not everyone wants to be in the army.\u000a \u000a The army's a fantastic place, but not everybody wants to be there. You do understand, right?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay. Anybody not want to be in the army?\u000a I want to serve my country.\u000a Yeah. Would you want to live in a country where everybody had to do it?\u000a  No.\u000a I want to have a choice.\u000a You want to have a choice. I want my army to have chosen to be there. Right? Because I don't want a bunch of people there twiddling their thumbs and not wanting to be there, okay? Okay. Describe the action in the cartoon.\u000a Action?\u000a I can't cover those.\u000a I forgot to put the space bar. Okay, so what's happening in the cartoon? We've already said this.\u000a Everybody's coming to Uncle Sam.\u000a And what's happening?\u000a The cloud is trying to get them away from Uncle Sam.\u000a Right. All right. What is the message of the cartoon?\u000a It's that we have to welcome the immigrants.\u000a Correct. The message of the cartoon is that the U.S. is welcoming immigrants who are trying to get away from places they don't like. What special interest groups-- now this one I remembered to put the extra thing in there so you all have to think about it. What special interest groups would agree or disagree with this cartoon? Stop and take a second. Turn to your partner. See if you can think of somebody that would like this cartoon and somebody that would not like this cartoon. Talk to you partner.\u000a What is it?\u000a Okay. A special interest group. Go ahead, keep talking. A special interest group is a group that talks to the government to try to get them to make laws for them, okay? So what kind of group would agree with the cartoon and what kind of group would not agree?\u000a

V  Happy, tiny, small, silent, little, quiet, glad.\u000a  Right. Some of these words too you might not even know what they mean, but once you work with synonyms a little bit you're going to actually make your vocabulary a little better. You're going to learn what more words mean. Okay, so that'll help you read and everything. Nicolet.\u000a  That's silent and quiet.\u000a Okay, you want to come up and match those? Let me put it on pen. Okay. You have to move over a little bit. Great, okay. Is she right guys? Good. How did you know that those were synonyms?\u000a Because both of them mean that... Because both of them mean... Both of them mean the same thing.\u000a  Okay, they mean the same thing or what else, Jabril? Oh, you have another one you want to mark? They mean the same thing right. You can make up a sentence like we should be quiet in the library and then you could take out the word quiet and put silent in. We should be silent in the library. That's how you can check it to make sure of it.\u000a It's like a better word.\u000a A better word, quiet or silent. Okay, Fernando, you see one? Okay, what do you see? Oh great. Can you tell us what you have?\u000a Happy and glad.\u000a  Happy and glad. Okay, pick a sentence for those. Can you think of a sentence?\u000a I'm happy.\u000a  Because?\u000a Because my birthday is coming.\u000a Okay, I'm happy because my birthday is coming. Let's take out happy. You guys can take it and throw it away. Take out happy and put this word in.\u000a Glad.\u000a Okay, now say the sentence with glad.\u000a I'm glad because my birthday is coming.\u000a Alright, very good . Okay, you ready Jabril? You got one? Okay, what did you find?\u000a Smiley and little. No, small and little.\u000a Okay, is he right guys?\u000a  Yes.\u000a He is, very good. You started to say smiley and little, right? But then you said, wait a minute, those aren't... What is that called? Those aren't...\u000a Right.\u000a Synonyms, right? So then you remembered that word is small and little. Okay, very good. Anyone else? Who hasn't gone? Barbara.\u000a But there's no words.\u000a Is that all of them, alright good.\u000a  No. Tiny and little.\u000a Oh, small, little, and tiny, they all go together, don't they? That's right, there's three words that mean the same thing. Small, tiny, and little. Okay, so there can be more than one synonym for a word. That's a good point. Do you guys want to practice saying synonym? Cause it sounds likes it's hard to say. Let's clap it, ready.\u000a   Synonym.\u000a Let's try again.\u000a   Synonym.\u000a Let's just slow down a minute.\u000a   Syn, o, nym.  Syn, o, nym. \u000a Alright, we'll keep practicing. Okay, now we need to read these sentences and find out which ones have synonyms. Okay, let's start with this one. Nicolet, can you read that?\u000a The dog is angry. The dog is mad.\u000a  Are those synonyms?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Which two words?\u000a Angry and mad.\u000a  Okay, you want to come on up? You're going to circle those sentences and that dog. Look at his face too. Okay, if you're writing, you could use the word mad. That's kind of, like I just call it a first grade word, sort of. You want to bet a sparkle word so you could say he's angry. You could also say he furious. The dog is furious. That's an even better word, right? A better synonym. Jabril, you want to do the next one? Okay, can you read these?\u000a The dog it sick. The dog is ill.\u000a So sick and ill, are those synonyms? Good. Oh, you're getting creative with our circles. Okay, Barbara, you want to read this one?\u000a The dog is sad. The dog is crying.\u000a Okay, are those synonyms?\u000a Yes.\u000a Well, sort of. He would be crying if he's sad. I'm not sure that they mean the same thing. Like if you said, Barbara fell down and now she is crying. Right, that's something that you do, right? Barbara fell down and now she is sad, but it doesn't really mean the same thing. It's close. You want to try this one?\u000a The dog is happy. The dog is glad.\u000a Okay, happy and glad, do those mean the same thing? What do you guys think? Yes, you agree? Okay, so then she's going to circle that one. Put a big circle around the whole thing. Okay, great. OK, who hasn't had a turn? Fernando, can you read this one?\u000a The dog is surprised.\u000a  Oh, good reading.\u000a The dog is--\u000a Scared.\u000a Scared.\u000a So surprised, see his face? Is surprised and scared, are those synonyms?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay, who says yes? Fernando says yes. Who says no? Okay, what do you think? If I'm surprised, I just walked in and everyone's throwing me a party, I said  I'm so surprised. Would I also say I'm so scared?\u000a No.\u000a  No, I'd probably be really happy. So are these synonyms?\u000a  No.\u000a No, okay, nice job guys. Okay, let me see where I want to go. Okay. Alright, the next thing we're going to do before we do this, is I'm going to see if you can match some synonyms with a fishbowl and a fish. Who likes fish? Really? What's your favorite animal? Favorite pet? Do you have a favorite pet? Do you like ?\u000a Dog.\u000a  You like dogs?\u000a Cats.\u000a  You like cats?\u000a \u000a  Do cats eat fish sometimes?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Uh-oh, uh-oh, well.\u000a They eat mouse.\u000a  They eat mice, right.\u000a Fish.\u000a  Well, we're going to do a fish game and you're going to do this with a partner. Okay, I'm going to ask Jabril and Barbara to sit at the back table. Hold on a minute, wait for your directions. And we are going to move those things out of the way. And you're going to see if you can match the synonyms together. The fish with the fishbowl, okay? Now be sure like when we've worked with pairs before that one person's not doing all the work and the other person is just, you know, watching. Okay, make sure if you think two words go together then you say, do you think these words, or are these synonyms? You need to talk to your partner. You need to agree, okay? So you two can go to the back table with those. Mix them all up. Mix all your fish up and put them on fishbowl pouch. Okay, and I'll come over and help you read some of the words that you might have trouble with. Okay, mix them all up. And I'm going to walk around, but I want you to try to work kind of your own a little bit with your partner. Okay, so let me help you read this word. Tease, messy, speedy, sleep, sprint. Okay, so those are your fishbowls. Run, fast, sloppy. This looks like brother, but it's bother.\u000a Bother.\u000a And doze. Doze. Okay, so you guys can sort of see what you can put together and I'll be back in a minute, okay? Make sure you're talking to each other. Do you need help reading? Stare, mad.  Friendly, scream. This is nice, angry, , yell, . So you need to talk to your partner. Says.\u000a  I want to put it on speedy.\u000a Oh, speedy, yeah that's right.\u000a  Hold on, she's talking to you.\u000a I want to put it on...\u000a  Friendly. Do you agree that those are synonyms? Okay.\u000a Can you help me with this word?\u000a Angry.\u000a Tease.\u000a  Tease.\u000a Okay, look.\u000a  What word means the same as tease? Did you talk to your partner about those? Make sure he agrees with what you chose.\u000a What was this?\u000a  Doze.\u000a Doze and sleep.\u000a  Are those synonyms? Okay, do you know what-- It's hard if you don't know what a word means so I can help you. Do you know what the word doze means?\u000a Yeah, it means that like you're tired.\u000a Um-hum, and you might doze off. Like if you're watching TV and all of a sudden your eyes are closed, you dozed off.\u000a And then sleep.\u000a And sleep. Okay, so do you agree with that? Which ones did you pick there?\u000a Scream.\u000a Okay.\u000a \u000a Did you ask her?\u000a No, I didn't.\u000a No, ask her.\u000a Is this bother?\u000a Yes.\u000a Do you know what bother and tease mean?\u000a They both mean like they're bothering.\u000a Okay, like my sister keeps bothering me. My sister keeps...\u000a Touching me. Teasing me.\u000a Teasing me, right. You can use those words kind of the same, right? Okay, so you can run around the track or you can sprint around the track. This one actually goes here. Now you have speedy and messy, sloppy and fast. Okay, what'd you find? Stare.\u000a This means because they both mean that they're matched and this one .\u000a  Scream and yell, right.\u000a \u000a  Soaked. Great. Okay, looked and stare. Nice and friendly. Angry and mad. Wet and soaked. Yelled and screamed, awesome. Okay, bring your fishbowls back over. Okay, how'd everybody do over here?\u000a  Good.\u000a Okay, everybody choose one bowl and one fish. Just one that you think you can make a sentence up with. Okay. So you can choose any bowl with a matching fish and you have to make up a sentence where you're going to use both words, both synonyms. Okay, Barbara, you ready? What did you find? Which two words? Tell us your words first.\u000a Friendly and nice.\u000a  Okay, so are you ready to make up a sentence?\u000a I am nice and friendly.\u000a  Okay, you put them in the same sentence. Does anybody have a way that she could make her sentence different, because nice and friendly could mean anything. You have an idea?\u000a This time I'm using friendly.\u000a  Okay.\u000a I am friendly.\u000a  How about a new classmate?\u000a Yeah, a new classmate.\u000a Okay, so that's using friendly. Now you're going to take out this word and use the synonym, I am?\u000a I am nice to everybody in my--\u000a  To the new--\u000a New student.\u000a  Classmate, right. You use the same words in your sentence. You just are going to change your synonym. Okay, good job, very good job. Okay, Nicolet. Show us your words first. What do you got?\u000a Doze and sleep.\u000a  Okay.\u000a I'm using the doze. Doze means that I am...\u000a  You can put I-N-G at the end if you want. Like dozing.\u000a I am dozing out in the car.\u000a   Okay. I am dozing out in the car.\u000a And then I am sleeping in the car.\u000a  Okay, did she do that right?\u000a Um-hum, yes.\u000a  It makes me think of when you're on a long trip, right? Has that ever happened to you?\u000a Um-hum.\u000a  Yeah, when have you done that?\u000a I've done that when we went to Charlotte.\u000a  Okay, and you took a little sleep in the car?\u000a Um-hum.\u000a  Okay, alright, Fernando.\u000a

V  Five, four, three, two, one, stop. I'm going to follow the same norms you are, so if I want to talk, I'm going to have to raise my hand. Does anybody want to start us off? Sort of an initial response, or something that's been on your mind, or a place we can go in the play to start this conversation?\u000a  In the last act, when Emilia and Iago, or Iago's been caught, and Emilia is piecing together all of these things that Iago's done, how it all works, and she's telling the others around him what he's done, he keeps telling her, "Be quiet, this isn't your place to talk, "you shouldn't be here." But, whereas most stereotypical women would have just kind of followed what their husband wanted, and just you know, kind of been in the background, Emilia actually stands up and says what she thinks is right.\u000a \u000a  Yeah, okay.\u000a What  also talked about was how Desdemona kind of juxtaposes that in that she's like the very stereotypical housewife, to the point at which she refuses to even like blame her husband for killing her, so we kind of, it's interesting how those two characters are just...\u000a  To touch on the racism part, I would have to say it's not, and at least if it is, that isn't the main focus of the play. I'd say that it's focused more on these complex characters and their web of lies, and the plot itself isn't focused on, if it is, I think  because I don't really think it is.\u000a  I kind of agree with Chloe. I don't think that Othello is a racist or sexist play. It does have racism and sexism in it, but that's because it was written by William Shakespeare in a time when that was the norm. You can't really look at it as a modern person, because we think of racism and sexism so differently from the audience it was intended for. They thought of it as more of the norm, so it does seem more normal. Like it seemed believable and normal to them, because that's just how their society was.\u000a  Then it also kind of looks at like how racism sort of caused it, like Iago hates Othello, and one reason that he gives is that he's black and he doesn't deserve his position, and he kind of uses race to his advantage to do bad things. So it's kind of looking at, it's not racist, it's looking at racism and sexism, and saying like how they can be used and manipulated, you know?\u000a  Yeah, I kind of agree with you. I think this play is really about like taking advantage of people any way you can. So like if you have something on them, like they're a different color, or if they're a different sex, then you can use that to your advantage by like putting that as an excuse almost, to take advantage.\u000a  Let's return to that. Raise your hand if Iago was your favorite character in this class. Come on. I mean, this is a, I have to say, I agree. I would raise my hand to that question, which I find troubling, because I certainly agree with some of the opinions that I'm hearing here, that we have this interesting contrast between Emilia and Desdemona, as two different ways women can live with male violence, and we also have this examination of how racism and sexism are used as part of the plot to take down Othello. But at the same time, I have to say, I think that it feels to me like the play is set up for us like Iago more. Iago talks to us, he lets us into his world, into his mind in a way that nobody else does. So I'd almost feel like we can't blame ourselves as the audience for identifying with him, for secretly making part of us rooting for him, or he even made me sort like glorying in his intelligence and his capacity for manipulation and just his power. And I wonder what we do with that, because if you walk away from this play being like, "I love Iago!" Then aren't you also kind of saying, in a way, celebrating what he's done? Do you agree with me? Disagree with me?\u000a  I think his ability to like, his like logic, and how he like plans things, like how he like manipulates a lot of situations, and how he like schemes to like use people's like baggage, I guess, to his advantage, is kind of like I guess like the way he uses it isn't a good way, but like if you could use it in a different way, I guess it like could be viewed as like a good thing. So, \u000a I think there's a difference between like celebrating what he's done, and just appreciating like the amount of thought and like intelligence that he has in using it in a bad way, because like you can like Iago, and like him for different reasons than, "Oh, I like what he's done, "I like how he destroyed this person." It can be just, you know, "I realize that "this is a very smart person, "and someone I really would not want to be on his bad side." But like you just sort of, you realize like how much, I guess yeah, I'll just use the word appreciate again. You just appreciate like how much, you understand his mind, and it's just really interesting, rather than you love him.\u000a Yeah, I think it's more like, sometime's it's fun to like root for like the evil character. Because you wouldn't actually do it, like if you play video games like Grand Theft Auto,  Like you kill the hookers, it's not like--  you would have to do that, it's just that it's fun. \u000a  Oh my God! \u000a  Well, it doesn't surprise me that Iago's the one that most people come away from the play with being like, "Yeah, he's so great, he's so interesting," right? Because like he's the only character that you actually get to know. Everyone else just kind of like dies. They get drunk and like stab people, or they cry. That's pretty much what everybody else does, and then Iago's the one who like lets you in, lets you know what he's thinking, when he's bringing specific elements, like with each person in the play, he's different from each person, and you can see that through the play.\u000a Well, as she was saying, like how everyone else was crying and like going crazy, or like either having an awful time or having a good time, like they still trust Iago, even though he's standing there not doing that with them. I mean, just like the way he's able to still convince them whenever he's not, he doesn't seem like he's on the, like he convinced them that he's on their side, but he's not actually doing everything they are, or he's not really doing anything to show them that's he's isn't feeling what they're feeling. Alex?\u000a I have a quote, I guess. It's at  around there. "And their palates both for sweet and sour, "as husbands have, what is it they do "when they change us for others? "Is it sport? I think it is. And doth affection breed it? "I think it doth. Is't frailty that thus errs? It is so too. "And have we not affections, desires for sport, and frailty, "as men have? Then let them use us well, else let them know, "the ills we do, their ills instruct us so." So it's kind of like talking about how the men control the women, and so I guess like that's like the sexism of the day, or like of that era, and like this is Emilia, she's talking to Desdemona, and she's talking about how like men control them, and all their thoughts are kind of implanted by the men, like Emilia, like she got the handkerchief because her husband told her to do that, and they're all just really obedient and everything. Chloe?\u000a  I mean, I think that, yeah it has to do with the time period, as far as the sexism in the play or whatever, but I mean because that it's just the way it was, but I think that when you look at the female characters in the play, like Emilia, she turns out to be one of the most influential characters, and she's the one that takes down the bad person. It's her that takes down Iago, pretty much, because she tells him the truth, and then something that none of the men could do, or even question. Then the other thing I would say is that the women's loyalty to each other, especially Desdemona to Emilia, because it's back earlier in the play, I don't actually have it, but Emilia, I mean, Desdemona sings a song earlier in the play, something, "Willow, willow, willow," some more stuff about the song, and then when Emilia's dying, she sings a line from that exact same song, and she says, she references, "my mistress death." So I think a lot of it shows how the women stick together.\u000a It's also kind of like, I mean, I agree with you, and I mean it's not sexist, it looks at sexism, because I mean you see how Desdemona is the stereotypical woman of that time, and she kind of does what her husband tells her to, she doesn't rebel against him, she is completely loyal to him, regardless of how he treats her. I mean, he's hit her, and she just accepts it. Even when he kills her, she takes the blame and doesn't rat him out, and it just kind of, you have problems respecting her because of it. Like I mean, she's a good character, but you just can't, it's really hard to respect someone who just accepts everything that is done to her like that. Then you have to juxtapose it with Emilia, and she was a really influential character, and is able to rise above, and kind of try to take down her own husband and go against it. It's kind of looking at sexism and saying like, you know, which is better for you? Which do you like more? Look at how the sexism and the roles of women has affected Desdemona, and then how Emilia's been able to rise above it.\u000a  Can I jump in?\u000a Yeah.\u000a I definitely agree with you, but my thoughts are also going back to Act I, Scene III, because I think at the beginning of the play, Desdemona is very much not a stereotypical woman. She has married the man she loves, defying her father. Knowing her dad wouldn't like it, she ran off and married him anyway. When Othello's talking about how he won her heart, it was by telling the stories of the wars, and it's actually  very interesting, because it says that Desdemona would seriously . She would be very interested in these stories, even to the point where she wished she had been born a man. Then, when Othello says, "I have to go to war," and the Duke says, "Let's like Desdemona "stay at her dad's house," Desdemona says, "No, I married this man "to be with him. Let me go to the war, also." So at least at that scene, I think that she's a model of a very, very active woman who wants to go to war with her husband, she wants to be with her husband. When Othello comes out in Act II, Scene III to stop the fight between Cassio and Roderigo, Desdemona comes out, too, and says, "What's going on, what's wrong?" And Othello says, "Come away sweetie, let's go back to bed." Right? I certainly agree that there's a passivity in Desdemona by the end, but I don't know if I see that so much at the beginning. Go ahead.\u000a  I agree, I think that like sometimes Desdemona wants to be the stereotypical woman, and then like other times, she wants to be the like "rebel," kind of, because like Mr. Proctor said, like she completely rebels against her dad at the beginning, and then also like, she's not the stereotypical woman, because like every single man like in the play has admitted that she's the most beautiful woman, that they want her and all this stuff, and so she has some power over them, too. But yeah, I just think it's interesting how like there are scenes where she's the complete like stereotypical housewoman, and then other times, she's like completely passive.\u000a Even though it's been brought up that she defied her father to marry Othello, she's still, I feel like she's still very like part of that time period, as far as the role of women, because even though Othello wasn't her perfect husband in the eyes of her father, she still jumped from the control of one man, her father, to another man, her husband. So, Tanya?\u000a  Okay, so about Desdemona, I think that like even though she did that stuff, she still was a stereotypical woman. Like we said before, those women, they're supposed to be obedient to their husbands, so like whenever she does kind of like rebel and do something different from, or like kind of jump in to the conver- like Mr. Proctor was saying, like those examples, she's doing it for Othello. She jumps in, like she goes to war to be with him, and then she comes in like whenever he's in trouble. And then, the thing about Emilia is she's doing stuff for herself. Like in Act IV, Scene III, yeah, that's what we read, she's talking about how it's just like, she would cheat on her husband once. It's just like she says, "The world's a huge thing, "it is a great price for a small vice."\u000a

V  In my classroom, each student has their own individual workbench with a set of hand tools in the drawers, where they also may store their art and they've each made a back splash of art inspirational images. In the corner of the room, I have a resource area including images of art, books and magazines, a computer with an internet connection, and examples. I have a board where I give notes and it has a calendar with the semester at a glance. I have a demo table where we meet for discussions and group demonstrations. In the corner of the room, there's acid etching done safely with rubber gloves and goggles and a rubber apron. In front of that there's soldering with a acetylene tanks chained to the cabinet and a good ventilation system above, and also, eye protection and gloves. The sink area includes an emergency eyewash station and soaps. In the corner of the room, you see a fire extinguisher, a buffing machine, a hammering area done safely with a stump to limit the percussive nature of each blow, and ear protection, a drill press done safely with eye protection and gloves, an emergency eyewash station and shower, and first aid kit. In here, we have an enamelling area above banks of labeled cabinets with ventilation. And in the front, we have a bulletin board with notices and class rules and another fire extinguisher. This is another reason why people might own jewelry or want to have jewelry. Now this isn't jewelry per se You know what these are?\u000a Coins?\u000a Coins. There's such an interesting iconography of coins. I love the patterning that happened when he cast them. I mean, I just think its... You've got the horse. You've got the man. Some sort of a symbol. I don't really know what all the symbols are, but you could really use a lot of this. And do research symbols like for the production project that is coming up. And here people have even made jewelry out of the coins. And here art is an example of, in north Africa, a lot of times women, traditional women, it's probably changing now, but I don't really know how much it's changed or not changed. This picture is from 1988 or something, so it's in the past. But they would get a lot of their wealth from their family given to them as jewelry. And they'd wear it everyday. And it might seem ridiculous to us, you can do your farming, you're going about your business, cooking and you're wearing all that craziness, but that way it's on them, they have it, if something happens to their husband, nobody can take it away because it's on their body. It's protected. It's also very obvious. If the husband were to steal the money, and take it away, they would know because she's not wearing it. So he would be shamed. So it's sort of... it's like the dowry, the money comes into the family from the woman's parents, but it's also to help protect the woman. It's not just... it's not just to go to the husband. So I think it's amusing that they're wearing it.\u000a I thought they weren't allowed to wear makeup.\u000a Well, it depends in what part of-- where you are. I mean, are you thinking who is they?\u000a I'm thinking Iran and stuff, and north Africa.\u000a Right. Iran, there's different sects of Islam and what people believe as really strict is different. In this, north Africa... Iran's more in the Middle East, getting closer... I mean, does it even... even in Asia, it might even be Asia.\u000a No, it's not in north Africa.\u000a It's not in Africa. So this is like... north Africa, there's a lot of tribal groups that were nomads in the desert. It's all intermixed. And people in southern Africa, like in Sudan are predominantly Islamic and they have a different take on it, too. So maybe in Iran it's frowned upon as vanity, but...\u000a The Muslim culture requires women to cover their faces. It's not Muslim religions that only...\u000a It's Arabian.\u000a That's very good, Chloe. Very, very astute.\u000a It's there traditions. It's not required by the religion, it's a cultural thing.\u000a That's good. That's a good clarification. I didn't think of it that way. So also, this redeemable investment or wealth, people like to and they have people over for dinner.\u000a Golden silverware?\u000a On the right, that was the silverware of Marie Antoinette.\u000a I've never heard of gold silverware.\u000a So gold, I know, they're eating on gold. And it can't be 24 carat, because it would be too soft. But it's probably a gold alloy. And there's also cases of people when times get tough, melting down their silverware.\u000a So they can have the...\u000a Yeah, and you use that as your... it's like people nowadays are investing in gold. They're buying gold bars, because it's like you own something. You see it. It's not just a piece of paper that says you own something.\u000a Yeah, I think there's commercials about buying gold.\u000a And this is a chalice through the church. The church accumulated a lot of wealth, specifically, the Catholic church during the Medieval times. And they would have it made into these things like the chalice for the blood. Okay, attraction and beauty. This is pretty obvious, because where do people usually wear jewelry?\u000a On their necks and faces and...\u000a Yeah, yeah, to draw attention, I think, to the face usually is a big deal. And also, this is an example of a Cartier necklace that was a gift from a man to a woman. So a lot of times, it's with the idea of love, or commitment, romantic love. Here we have Indians from India, and these are things that you can buy. This is just off of that. So this is like the traditional wedding where you've got kind of an inexpensive version, perhaps, that you can buy. There's all sorts... there's all levels of expense that you can buy. And here we are again with north Africa. Just kind of thinking about the different ideas of what is beautiful and what isn't beautiful. I don't know. How many of you have tattoos? Any of you have a tattoo?\u000a I wish.\u000a Okay, I mean you're a little bit young. Right? Do you think you might want a tattoo at some point?\u000a Yeah, my friend has a whole entire paragraph on her back.\u000a Really? Do you like it?\u000a Yeah, it's really pretty, but I wouldn't want something like that. Yeah.\u000a I don't remember what it says... Something, it has to do with swimming, I think.\u000a It's like swimming.\u000a In some way. It's a really good quote, though.\u000a Yeah, she looks like that girl from Avatar.\u000a You know, I haven't seen Avatar, but as a movie designer, James Cameron, what do you think he was looking at to get inspiration for the movie?\u000a Probably... \u000a If you, I mean, does anybody like Star Wars? That was a popular kind of thing. But you know, I always wanted the hair braids. "Mom, mom, please." She's like, "Your hair isn't long enough. That was a movie. They had... it was a wig." I was like, "Do it. Do it."\u000a I braid my hair, put beads in it sometimes.\u000a There are cultures that wear their hair like that. So it's like nothing is sort of new under the sun. People are reinventing what's already happened.\u000a I always wanted it just like Pocahontas that's the entire story. \u000a The second time I saw it, I was like, "Oh, this is really bad." One thing, they represented it wrong, that's like the reason they were there because it was very valuable...\u000a Oh, so you're thinking it could have been a little more creative?  \u000a You know, the first time you see it, it's so good. And then the second time you're like, "Hey, now that I've seen this..."\u000a So it's good to critique pop culture to determine. If you get a job in the movies, how would you do it better or differently?\u000a I'd do a different plot. I'd be more creative. \u000a Okay, yeah, we better... I'm gonna keep moving on. All right? Okay, so here we have ancient Egypt on the left and we have Miss South Carolina 2000, I can't remember, 2004, 2006, recently. Isn't it interesting how similar the eye, the eyeliner, the long eyebrow, the hair coming down, the crown? You know, I mean...\u000a I think the eyebrows .\u000a Well, she doesn't have the... \u000a I'm trying to create a bead kind of thing.\u000a Okay.\u000a Melting the stuff Drew was using for his corset together.\u000a Oh, the screen? So you're melting the screen? Oh, interesting. So how will you use that in your... ?\u000a I'm thinking I can use it in attaching, because I think it would look cool if there was something kind of like that, not gold and shell-ish.\u000a Okay. Okay, well, do you want to go look at your stuff? Or do you want to... or you feel like you need to finish that?\u000a Oh, no, that's fine. \u000a There appears to be no blue stuff.\u000a Oh, the pickle? It's new.\u000a Oh.\u000a It only gets blue from the copper, so it, it does have pickle in it. It's just fresh and new. So you could, you could... see that little yogurt container? You can put it in that, and that has holes in it, and then you can just kind of let that float. Just kind of put a little in there. Like tip it. Yeah, that's good. Okay, yeah, let's go look at your... Oh, should we look at those? Would you rather do those, or... Okay, let's go...  Sorry, we're going outside now.\u000a Okay. \u000a Oh, wow. What do you think?\u000a I like them. I really like them as not a shell color, because they don't seem...\u000a Can I touch it? Sorry, I touched it before I asked you.\u000a I think once you like...as I did, just find the shell along the stream.\u000a Right, you're transforming it. I really like the shell of the spray paint too, because it helps tie it in with the metal. It makes... well, it's metallic spray paint, so it seems really metal-y, yeah. Right. Cool. And it makes it a little bit more blingy. You know?\u000a And I like how it reflects the light, all the cracks, and stuff.\u000a Yes, it gives it a unifying presence instead of having all that color variation. Especially if you think about having one necklace that has many shells on it. Then this unifies them. It makes them probably a little bit more wearable with people's clothes. Do you think? About how would you, how will you attach... are you thinking of using these in one group? Or are they more pendants?\u000a I think they're more like pendants, and I was gonna poke a hole.\u000a Okay.\u000a Like two holes in them, and I was gonna use a bunch of different strings together. So it's kind of like. . .and they're right there. And maybe bead it, a bunch of beaded strings.\u000a So really, this is like one necklace that's... or is it many necklaces that people can layer?\u000a It's just one necklace.\u000a Okay, all right. Well let's... can we go look at your sketch book, too? The other thing is, next time it would be better, I think, to drill the hole first before you paint it.\u000a Okay.\u000a Because I'm afraid the paint might scratch in the process of drilling the hole.\u000a I was going to just poke a hole with a needle.\u000a Can you do that?\u000a I think so. I mean, they're really a lot more soft than metal.\u000a Oh, okay, well try it, and see if it works. But I have a diamond drill bit. It can drill and that's what Drew has been using to drill his glass and stuff.\u000a Okay, and also, most of these already have holes.\u000a Oh, yeah, because of the creature that eats the muscle.\u000a Yeah.\u000a I love the hole that's already in there, yeah, okay. All right, let's go look at that. These probably need to dry a little more.\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay, okay, let's go in.\u000a There's only five more minutes on here.\u000a Okay, that's good. We'll get this and that'll be okay. \u000a Oh, look at that. See, that's amazing to me, because whenever I find coquinas, I guess I find the live coquinas. I've never seen the shells, like just the shells. But they all have a hole. This is a great find.\u000a I got my back so sunburned gathering all of these on the beach.\u000a Yes.\u000a Because they all lay next to each other in the sand.\u000a And when you, I mean, now do you have sketches of how these might be transformed into jewelry?\u000a I'm not sure yet, because...\u000a Here, I'll come over... is this better like this?\u000a Yeah.\u000a I could use like... I could put them all together on one string, on one necklace. Sort of like the coral. But I don't know. I don't think I have enough for that from reproduction.\u000a Well, you have a lot. What might be better, right, because, you're right. Because then they would nest. Right? If you just put with cubicle, then they don't take up much space. What if you made a bunch jump rings with thin wire, and then you have a little jump ring that would go through each one. And that could put... see how you have sort of charms on your chain? You could... these could also be sort of like charms hanging down, and you could layer them maybe with a jump ring, could have a little chain. And it could hang down to vary the length or, or you said that you like to use... did you make your necklace that's woven there? That's, okay, you, but you know how to sew? So could you sew them on something?\u000a I could, yeah.\u000a I mean, I have some leather strip, and that would be keeping with natural materials. So that might be interesting. I don't know. I... well, I think what you need to do is to experiment, sew some, do some metal through some, and then maybe lay some out. And you can see how Chloe has hers laid out in that box, so that she can keep it. I think you'd need a box or a tray, and you could sort of lay it out so you can start to see the composition of them.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Now what are these?\u000a Those are... \u000a Oh, and these are a dove's feathers.\u000a They're so elegant.\u000a Yes.\u000a Now do you have your sketch book? Can we look at the sketch on how you thought you might do this? \u000a Here, I think I got it.\u000a Here you go. I could do this with the shell.\u000a Oh, because that's hanging off. And then what is this round ring part?\u000a I'm not sure. It could just be like a round, golden...\u000a It could be a soldered ring of metal, like brass, wire soldered together. Is this an earring?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay.\u000a That may be for these.\u000a Right.\u000a That was... that's what I was planning to do with the shell. For that, I could do a bunch of different strings, or I could just do one string and put two of these sort of up the string, or something.\u000a Right, right, asymmetry. Okay, I like it. And then this is the feather? These are jump rings and this is the feather.\u000a

V  Can someone come up and put number one on the graph? And then we're going to debate about it. Anassia, can you come up and show us where you think one should be? \u000a  Alright so, what I think is, I don't know if I'm right or wrong or whatever, but I thought kinda one is there. Do you guys see it?\u000a  No \u000a  OK back, can you give us a reason why?\u000a  OK, well it says David had drived back to pick up his credit card that he forgot at the restaurant, so I kinda think that from home, the restaurant must be close, that's why he took the chance to go back to get his credit card. We don't know if he has money on him, ya know? It could depend on circumstances, but I think that the restaurant was hella close, that's why he went back and went back home.\u000a  OK, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. wait. OK. So, honestly who has that opinion? So you think one is at the very beginning\u000a  Mmmhmmm.\u000a  of his trip? OK, can we have someone else draw another number one that is in a different place? Anassia, can you pick someone?\u000a  Overwhelming. You. \u000a  I put it right here. Right there.  Right there.\u000a  OK, can you give us a reason?\u000a  He's driving and then he goes to the restaurant, and then he's driving away. No! This is the restaurant right here, and then he's leaving and he's like, "Oh snap, I left my credit card." Then he goes back and then he's driving away. That's it.\u000a  OK wait, so whose idea do we agree with? Sidius or Anassia?\u000a  Sidius\u000a  - OK, but we still have to convince Anassia because she still thinks it's at the beginning, right?\u000a  I thought it was at the beginning too.\u000a  You did? Who convinced you?\u000a  Myself.\u000a  Yourself? \u000a  OK, so if David is driving back to the restaurant, then should his slope be what? What should his slope be?\u000a  Negative.\u000a  If he's going back to the restaurant? Right, because if I'm travelling this way, my slope's getting bigger, my distance is getting farther, But wait, I turn back so my slope has to be?\u000a Negative.\u000a Negative. So do you think one is when the slope gets negative?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a So are you convinced now Anasstia? That it has to be negative for him to go back?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a So are we OK with erasing that first one?  Well I have to erase all of it anyway. \u000a Oh OK, sorry. OK. So one should be where he's going back, right, where he's going negative, OK? Alright.  Is there a real end to it?\u000a Well we're going to see once we get through them.  Alright.\u000a So, Sidi, can you pick the next person to show us where number two should be?\u000a  No hands?\u000a  I would put two here.\u000a  Can you explain why, Candy? Wait, just give us an explanation.\u000a  Yeah, because he said that his car breaks down so he goes back so the slope is negative. He went back.\u000a  Close to his house.\u000a Yeah, near his house, but then it's near the beginning so the bilaterals have to be near zero. Because the line there represents the distance from his home, right?\u000a  I've got a question.\u000a OK\u000a You know how it says he is told a way to a repair shop near his house? We're looking at his car, not looking at the tow away car, aren't we? So wouldn't it be considered constant since his car is moving?  - So I guess the car is on the tow truck, right? So now, wherever the tow truck goes, the car has to go, right?\u000a  Yeah\u000a  Does anyone have a different place for number two?\u000a  No\u000a  So we all agree that two, no, do you want to put two in a different place? Put it in a different place. Let's see what you think. Put it in a different place, let's see what you think. Go.\u000a  I was thinking of putting it right here. That's what I was thinking.\u000a  That's what I thought too.\u000a  Can you explain why? Why?\u000a  Because he says that his car broke down and was towed back to his house. So I was thinking that the first sentence, so his car broke down. So if he was not going anywhere, then the time was going then constant, so if, as you see the time, his speed never changes while the time is just going down. That's what I think.\u000a  That's wrong. \u000a  We don't say that's wrong, we say, "Well, I disagree. Well." So convince him otherwise.\u000a  Because the car is still moving, and if you look really, really closer at the graph, the last point isn't directly on the girl so we can assume that since it says the the repair shop is near his house that the ending point would have to be somewhere near zero. Also, if it was constant, that means he would just be in one spot, but it's clearly saying that he's being towed back towards the repair shop, so he's in motion, like the slope is showing distance and not speed. Well the graph is showing that the slope is going somewhere.\u000a  So can I say two things? One thing, so it's a different interpretation of this problem, right? So if he was broken down and the car was just staying there, then would this be a good place for two?\u000a  Yes.\u000a If the car was just staying there because distance is not changing or is changing? It's not changing, right? Because time is going on, but distance is staying the same. However, number two says he's going to the repair shop close to his house. So is he just staying in one place? No, right? So he's gonna go back home, so if he's going back home so this slope would be negative or positive?\u000a  Negative.\u000a Negative. And it's going, here's home, right? So where does he go back home? Or very close to home? Here, right? Are you convinced Danny?\u000a  Yes.\u000a OK, let's erase the other number two. But Danny, thank you for being brave because I could understand that interpretation. Alright, Danny, can you pick someone to put number three on the graph?\u000a  OK, number three is over here.\u000a  I disagree.\u000a  Wait, wait.  We haven't even heard her explanation. Wendy, what's your explanation why?\u000a  Because it's stopped for gas and got a quick bite to eat it's kinda constant here so it can be stopped.\u000a  So why not the long one?\u000a  Because he's in the restaurant, I suppose.\u000a But then\u000a So if one is here, if one is here, it has to be in the restaurant then, right?\u000a Well then one is over there, so then why would three be all the way over there?\u000a One is here, right?\u000a No, no, no. One is all the way at the beginning.\u000a No.\u000a Sorry, that's "Y."  But then it says that he got a three.\u000a Yes, but it's here.\u000a Yeah, he ate there, so wouldn't that be the one? Like wouldn't that be where he gets his gas?  Number three said that he went to eat, but it doesn't say where did he eat. Maybe he just eat at that restaurant that he mention about.\u000a  Yeah, maybe he went a bit farther, and said, "OK, let me go somewhere else," so that's why.\u000a  So what did he do here?\u000a  Eat and gas. \u000a It doesn't take that long to eat. \u000a  One hour? People take a bit to longer to fill up on gas and then they can't just eat while they're getting gas. Oh let me eat while I'm getting gas.\u000a  OK, so are we going to take a longer time at the restaurant or a longer time at the gas station?\u000a  The restaurant.\u000a The restaurant. So do we want the slope to be zero for a long period of time or just for a short period of time?\u000a Short\u000a Shorter than wherever you pick where the restaurant is, right? So we haven't gotten to the restaurant yet, have we?\u000a No.\u000a No, OK. So could three be the place where he stops and gets gas? Could it be?\u000a  Possibly. We don't know if quick bite meant one hour or meant half an hour.\u000a Or maybe it meant  five minutes?\u000a Yeah you know, you never know. So if we interpreted five minutes, gas and quick bite, quick sandwich. Could we put three at that place?\u000a Yes.\u000a Why?\u000a  Because the slope is almost constant for a short period of time.\u000a  I think that at three, he went back to the restaurant to get his credit card.\u000a  Maybe the gas station is near the restaurant. \u000a  Why you make this so difficult?\u000a  That's possible, though, right? I'm like thinking of putting at the beginning?\u000a Here?\u000a Here is four.\u000a  Wait, wait, wait. Don't go on four yet.\u000a  But I think the three should be before one. Because you can't just eat in the restaurant and then you eat a quick sandwich, \u000a  OK, we're going to do this because I like the debate you're having, but I want groups to think about it individually, and then we're going to come back. but I want to put one thing for sure on the board. OK, so If, if, if, if. If, If this is definitely Let's say this is definitely where David stopped to eat. OK, so this is where David is eating.  Eating as in, in the restaurant?\u000a Eating at the restaurant, yes. So here David is eating for a long time at the restaurant, OK? A long, long time. So that's the longest, is this the longest time where the slope is flat? Yeah. So we're all gonna agree right now that this is where David is eating at the restaurant. So this is where David is eating at the restaurant, can you put all the other numbers in a logical place? Because I hear you guys talking about logic. Like he can't go to the gas station before he does what?\u000a Goes to the restaurant and gets his credit card.\u000a OK, so, I see that's one logical statement so, in your groups, I'm gonna give you five minutes for this. Can you put one, two, three, and four in a logical place and have a good argument for it? OK.\u000a

V Okay guys, yesterday we talked about three key vocabulary words that we mentioned, we studied, we found definitions for. Those words were adaptation, there's habitat and community. Okay, adaptation is the first word. Who can tell me something about adaptation? Karina.\u000a Adaptation is how animals act, like the howler monkeys, they howl so they can tell other monkeys that they are in danger, so they can survive\u000a Okay, so they can survive, right? Adaptation helps them survive. And then, habitat. Who can tell me what habitat is? Ernesto.\u000a Where you live.\u000a Okay it's the environment where they live. It's the surroundings, okay? It's the trees, it's the plants, it's the ground, and it's the climate that they live in. And, the last one is community. Okay, so, if we're thinking about animals, what makes up a community for these animals? Who can tell me? Sergio.\u000a The community\u000a What makes up a community? It's not the environment\u000a The animals?\u000a It's all the animals. Do we have just one animal in the community? \u000a We have many, we have many. It could be very many. Okay, we're going to on, and I'd like you to listen to this sound. Shhhh. Just listen to this sound.  Okay, you may have, and you can hear this sound at night. Okay, what I'd like you yo do right now is tell me one thing that you know about this animal, okay. If you know the name of this animal, go ahead and write that down too. First of all. let's just write it in our "K". Just put it under for "K". What do you know about that animal? Just write it down first, then we'll talk about it. I'd like you to discuss what you know also. Talk to a neighbor. Okay, this is what you know, so you are going to be looking at that. What is something you know about that animal? Okay? Tell your neighbor "What do you know about this animal?" Just tell a neighbor. \u000a Tell a neighbor what you know. \u000a Tell your neighbor, Eddie, what you know. What do you know? You can talk out loud, guys.  Okay, small ears, okay. All right, so write that down. Okay, now after that go to what you want to know. Go to the "W". What do you want to know about this animal? By the way, what animal is this?\u000a An owl.\u000a It's an owl. It's a Great Horned Owl, okay. Now, what I'd like you to do, you want to put this information. Yea, what do you want to know. So, write one thing about what you want to know. What do you want to know? Tell a neighbor, "What do you want to know?" Sergio.  You don't have to whisper, you can say it.  How old an owl can live? Okay, good. Good, okay. Now, one thing I want you to think about. Let's listen to this sound again, okay? Listen to the sound again.  Any predictions, and you can just tell me, without writing them down. What do you think that-- Why does the owl make the sound that it makes? Yea\u000a Maybe to warn other owls.\u000a Warn other owls? Anything else? Yea, Ernesto.\u000a To communicate.\u000a And to communicate, that's right. Okay, let's take a look a page twenty-three. Okay, we're going to look at text structure on page 23. This is the Great Horned Owl. And, I'd like everyone to put your finger on the title for this animal, the Great Horned Owl. Just put your finger so I know you know what the title is. Next, I'd like you to put your finger on the caption. Okay, and can I have one person read the caption? Let's have Karina read the caption.\u000a Owls have large eyes to help them see in the dark.\u000a Okay, very good. Then we have, underneath the title of the Great Horned Owl, We have what I call bullet points. We talked a little bit about them. And, put your fingers on the bullet points there. And, let's have Ernesto read those bullet points.\u000a Bird found in North, Central, and South America. Live in the canopy and understory.\u000a Understory, very good. And we live in what continent? Eddie, what continent do we live in?\u000a North America.\u000a North America. So, we'll find these, and actually I will usually hear these at night. And usually hear them kind of in the winter time. All right, let's have the first paragraph. Eddie, why don't you continue?\u000a The Great Horned Owl has no ears, but can hear anyway. It can also see very good, even on the darkest night.\u000a Okay, and the second paragraph, Makayla.\u000a An owl hunts for food at night from high in the air. When it hears a mouse move or squeak, the owl swoops down upon it.\u000a Swoops, okay very good. Okay, now we've read about the Great Horned Owl. I'd like you to tell your neighbor, one thing that you learned new about this owl, that you are going to put down under the "L". What is one thing that you learned about the owl?  Okay, so write something down that you've talked about with your partner or your neighbor. Now we're going to continue working in partners here and I'm going to give you something to take a look at. And I'm going to have you guys, just close your books for a second. After you're done writing, close your books. Okay, I'm going to give each pair or each little group one of these sticks. I want you to look at the stick carfeully and look how an animal might have changed or interacted with the stick, okay? So take a close look at it, all right? And, take a look at it, and then I'd like you to put down what you know about that stick, okay? There are, yes you can see that some insects have interacted with the stick also. But what is something, look at the ends of the stick, and let's put down something we know about what an animal might have done to this stick. Okay, just write it down or tell your neighbor. Tell your neighbor.  Yeah, he bit the stick on here. But did he actually cut it? Was he able to bite it?\u000a Yes Yeah he was, he was. Okay, all right, now who can tell me what animal this might be? Karina.\u000a A beaver.\u000a It is a beaver and you will find these in this area. What I would like you to put down next is what you want to know about the beaver. So, let's write that down. Just skip this and go right to "What do you want to know?" Tell your neighbor. Go ahead and tell your neighbor about it. What do you want to know?  Okay, tell your neighbor, guys, too once you have written it down. \u000a How old can a beaver live?\u000a Okay, how old can a beaver live? That's good. Yea, Keelie.\u000a What I want to know how about are they electric.\u000a Okay.  Okay, I want to know how long they are in their house, maybe. Yes.\u000a I want to know how big can they be.\u000a Okay good\u000a I have hair on here.\u000a It's possible. Actually, yeah that is very possible, you have hair of a beaver I would actually, I'm going to hang onto that. And actually let's put that in the garbage. But, that's good.\u000a It's right here. \u000a Okay i'll take it. Okay. Yea, you're going to find that probably, we're not going to look at the sticks too much. We need to find insects still living in the stick, but we're going to leave that for right now. I'd like you to take a look at page twenty. Take a look at page twenty. I do recommend that if you ever by chance go to Deerbro, there's a forest near the school here. Your parents can take you. You might actually see a beaver house. Okay, let's find out some more information about beaver on page twenty. Put your fingers on the title. Put your fingers on the title. You know what, I'll take that. Here we go. And you know what, let me recollect these, because we have. Let me collect those back. Thank you. There we go. Okay, put your fingers on the beaver, the title, okay? Can I have one person read the bullet again? Bullet marks. Sergio, go ahead.\u000a Mammal found in North America, Europe, and Asia Lives in rivers and streams near the forest floor.\u000a okay, and can you name another mammal? If you happen to know what the mammal might be. Can you name another mammal?\u000a Whale.\u000a A whale is a mammal, and we are also mammals Okay, the next paragraph I'd like to have one person read that paragraph. Karina.\u000a Beavers eat bark, twigs, leaves and roots. They have wide flat tails. These tails help beavers to clear a placement, Beavers use their split claws to comb their own fur. They also use their claws to spread oil onto their fur. This oil helps keep them warm in the water.\u000a Okay, before we go on, as we're going to be looking at a lot of things, think about what it is you're learning. What's something new that you're learning about this beaver? Now, before we go on, everybody put your finger on the caption. Okay, caption. Makayla, what does the caption say?\u000a A beaver's fur keeps it warm in the snow.\u000a All right, very good. So, let's take one more thing. We're going to take a look at a diagram on page seventeen. So, now let's go to page seventeen. And this talks a little bit more about a beaver. And the title, let's put our finger on the title of page 17. What does the title say? Keelie\u000a Graph Section Diagram\u000a Okay, we're looking at page 17 right here. Put your finger on the top of the diagram, And that's the title. What does it say Keelie?\u000a Beaver lodge.\u000a Okay what is, we know a beaver is the animal, What's a lodge Keelie?\u000a Their house, where they live.\u000a Yea, it's like their house. Okay, next there's a caption built into the diagram and it's green. Let's have Sergio read the caption there.\u000a This beaver lodge was built on a shallow part of the wood floor. If it wouldn't float, the lodge will have to be rebuilt.\u000a Okay, very good. Let's get some more information. There's some other things in the diagram to give us information, Makayla.\u000a Some lodges are two meters, 6.5' high.\u000a Okay, very good. And, Keelie.\u000a The lodge is made from logs and sticks.\u000a Okay, and Eddie, the last one.\u000a Beavers come in and out under the water.\u000a Okay, so this is where they live. This is how they live, and why do you think they build their house this way? Anybody? What do you think they do? Why do they build it this way? Karina.\u000a Because when they, when people come, like hunters, if they want to catch them It is going to be difficult for them.\u000a Okay, like predators? Other predatory animals?\u000a Yeah. So this is a way they adapt. So, how do they adapt to survive in their environment? Makayla.\u000a To enter from the underground water.\u000a Okay, can you use adapt or adaptation in a sentence? Beavers...\u000a Beavers adapt to\u000a Beavers adapt how? Yea, Karina.\u000a Beavers adapt by entering from a little hole under the water.\u000a Okay, so they adapt in that way, other predators can't see when they're coming. And as we saw on the sticks, the sticks, they just pile these sticks up on here and they move them around until they make something that looks like this, okay? So, what kind of a habitat do the beavers live in again? Using the word habitat, I'd like you to tell me. What's the habitat of a beaver?\u000a They live in lodges.\u000a They live in lodges. Okay, what's around their lodge? Yeah, Karina.\u000a Sticks and wood.\u000a Okay, sticks, but then what is this blue stuff here?\u000a Water.\u000a It's water. Yeah, so they actually go underwater to get into their home. And that makes it very safe. So, I would like you to add one more thing to what you learned on the third column of this organizer. Okay? Okay, once you've got one third, okay. And, Eddie, when you've got something, why don't you tell your neighbor? When you've got something, tell your neighbor what you learned \u000a Like this?\u000a Okay. Actually, right here, yea. What you've learned.  Okay, and if you were to go out somewhere, and you were in the woods, what would you see? What do you think you would see from this house? This is all water, so all you're going to see... Are you going to see the hole that's here?\u000a No.\u000a No. What do you think you're going to see?\u000a The sticks.\u000a Just like a stick. Just a mound of sticks, about two meters high. Which is probably about that tall.\u000a

V  who's done writing? Okay. Alright. Ok, couple of goals for this piece today. Here's where we're at here. One, clearly get the notes and rhythms down, because this Comstock piece, ok, and so is the second Middleston piece, three, the primo. So we'll do both those today, wanna get the notes learned, the notes and rhythms learned, but I also want to treat this piece today as though it were a sight reading piece, just like if we were getting ready for contest in March, do one of those little example pieces for sight singing. So we'll treat this in the same manner as that. Then I wanted to also, as we're reading the piece, take a look at how the structure of the piece can inform how we might go about learning it. You'll see some things here in a minute. Alright, so, if we take a look at the piece and we've already written solfge in. We take a look at the piece, what markings on the score can you see that might jump out at you that might be different?  Repeats, okay, even before that, like right up by the title.\u000a  Canon.\u000a  Canon, what's that mean?  The canon, okay, what's a canon?\u000a  It's a round.\u000a  It's a round, right, so you have one set of music, and then the same set of music follows it later, right? We do that in warm ups, okay. Alright, so a canon. So you think soprano and alto are in canon?\u000a  It'd probably be women and men.\u000a  Probably women and men, good, good observation. So we look at the structure, where might that canon begin?  After a P at the bottom of the page, okay. So pick up to measure 11, alright. Okay, so what kind of material do the guys have there?\u000a  It says we mix with the women's structure.\u000a  Exactly, that same material that the girls do. So in our rehearsal, noting that this is a canon, at least to that point, how might we rehearse this or set it up so we can have success right away?\u000a  Girls and guys sing their parts together.\u000a  Girls and guys sing their parts together, good, easy. So if we do that, then what might something else be helpful for us to do? We're singing parts together... maybe pair up? Typically we get together and we chant, so let's do that first. Let's do the chanting just like we do for sight singing, so you can practice that. Okay, so what are our pairs gonna be? Soprano and tenor, so you have to move, and bass and alto. So starting at solfge, girls you start at the beginning, guys you simply start at measure... pick up at measure 11, okay? Go on and move. Yes, circle up right here. Alright, who's gonna be our leader?  Who wants to start us off?\u000a  Alena?\u000a  Alena? Okay, you can start us off.  Who's going to start the... you. Okay, there you go. Okay, good, go for it. Chant it, quickly.\u000a  Let's start at the beginning, we are on the pick up to 4. So 1, 2, 3, and 4. \u266b So so mi fa so do re mi \u266b \u000a  Okay so now we got to the end of that, go to measure 11 for the girls, and measure 21 for the guys. Go right there and start it again. So now girls you go measure 11, which is right where you finished, and guys go to 21. Same thing here that's a little bit different. \u000a  Alright, 1 and 2.  \u000a  Let's all chant together in rhythm. Stay in your groups. Stay in your groups please, but we're gonna start with the sopranos and altos, and then we'll pick up with the guys at the bottom of the page. So start at the beginning everybody. 1, 2, and ready, and go.  Stop, okay, now guys you're gonna pick up there, and girls, you're gonna come in 2 beats later. Here we go, ready and go.  Okay, go right on the coda please. So we would've done the repeat, now we go back here. Go right on the coda please, right after the double bar, ready, and go.  3, 4, fermata... cut off please. Sopranos, ready, and go.  Bass.  Okay, pretty good, we'll come back to that. That takes a little bit of fordating when you get together. Okay, go back to sections, let's do right in the... not your traditional sections. Let's keep the basses over here, altos over here, tenors and sopranos over here. So do two rows, back in your sections. Okay, so we're gonna do just like we chanted, we're gonna partner up, and we're gonna sing it at the same time. Okay, at the same time. So guys, you're starting in measure 11. Girls, you're starting in measure pick up to 1. Ready, and  \u266b Do do do do do \u266b Sing that first note please sopranos and altos, and  okay, tenors and  Basses, okay let's sing all at the same time right where your canon, first name of the canon is. Here we go, 1, 2, and ready, and sing.  Okay sopranos, sorry, altos and basses, here we go, \u266b Doo doo that's a mi \u266b Here we go, start that again, 1 and beginning and go.  Okay, go back to the do. \u266b Do mi so la \u266b Fa do la fa \u266b Sing that, ready, on the do, 1, 2.  Do that again, same spot, 1, 2.  Okay good, excellent reading, good for you. Now putting it together. Canon, lots of people think "oh canons are easy, no problem, it's the same thing." Except canons tend to be tricky, we'll see how it goes. Here we go, soprano and alto first. \u266b Do mi so mi do \u266b Sing your first notes girls, ready, and  Here we go, 1, 2, and ready and go  Okay good, I was gonna stop you before then, but you did so well, so we kept singing. Good for you. Okay, so what happens at 21 for the girls? Well not, sorry, measure 11 for the girls?  Does what, something different, so what would we call it? B, or the counter melody of this. Okay. So it's kind of the same shape, but it starts on what pitch class instead of do? No, sorry, what did we first start at the beginning? So and mi, and this starts on do. So different pitch class, same shape, but it's singing the fifth lower, okay, for soprano. Okay good, let me hear the guys please. You did really well until we got to the B section. Let me hear, actually let's hear everybody do the B section. So guys, you're gonna start at 21, girls, you're gonna start at 11. Basses, it's just... No it's not, it's not different at all. \u266b Do here is do \u266b Find your first pitch.\u000a

V  So, who can tell me, in this group, who can remind me, what is our objective? What are we discovering today in science? I'd like to see a lot of volunteers. Lindsey?\u000a  We're seeing what soil holds water better and...\u000a We're seeing which soil holds water better. What's the term for that? Holds water? Chris.\u000a  It's absorbing the water.\u000a What's absorbing the water?\u000a The clay and the sand absorb the water.\u000a Very good. So we're trying to figure out which absorbs more water. Clay or sand, today? Very good. Who can tell me what was the first step that you did in this project? Cameron.\u000a  First, we poured in the sand.\u000a What did you pour the sand into?\u000a We poured it into a funnel.\u000a Okay. What's that thing on the funnel?\u000a It's a coffee filter.\u000a It's a coffee filter. Why do we need a coffee filter on the funnel?\u000a Because when it's on the funnel it makes it so that the sand doesn't run through the funnel.\u000a Okay. All right. What's the second step? Can somebody tell me what the second step is? Cameron said you dump the soil sample, whether it was clay or sand, into your funnel. What's the second step? Caleb.\u000a  The second second step is to pour in the water.\u000a The second step was to pour in the water. Who can tell me what the third step is? What's the third step? Chris.\u000a You record how long it took for it to drip every last drop into the cup of water.\u000a What's it?\u000a The water.\u000a The water. Good. You're recording how long it took for all of the water... what's that word called? What did that water do to get from here to the surface to the bottom of the cup? Cameron?\u000a It drained.\u000a It drained. Very good. What are you measuring in? Are you measuring in seconds? Are you measuring in minutes? In hours? Lindsey?\u000a Measuring in minutes with the seconds.\u000a You're measuring in minutes with seconds. Okay. Can you tell me how long your clay is up to for draining out the water?\u000a Two minutes and a half.\u000a Two and a half minutes. Good. Can you tell me, Cameron, how long it took for your water to drain through your sand?\u000a It took 28 seconds.\u000a Twenty-eight seconds. Good job. Keep up the good work. I really like all the diagrams that I'm seeing. Lindsey, you did an excellent job at paying very close attention and following the steps, in step-by-step order. You can give yourself a point for science. Good job.  Ladies, can you tell me did your sand hold water?\u000a  Yes.\u000a It did hold water. How did you know that?\u000a Because it absorbs some of the water. I poured it in here and it had into the water, so the sand holds 11 milliliters of water.\u000a Good. So you're saying that the sand held 11 milliliters of water. You said that when you poured the water in through the sand then you dumped something in this graduated cylinder. What did you dump in this graduated cylinder?\u000a  We dumped all the water that was in there.\u000a What's there?\u000a In the cup.\u000a So you dumped all the water that was in the cup after what? What did the water do in order to get in the cup?\u000a It drained through the funnel, through the sand, down into the cup.\u000a So it drained through the funnel, through the sand, down into the cup. So then you took your water and you poured it in your graduated cylinder. Luana, you said you did 40 minus 29 to get 11 milliliters? Why did you do 40 minus 29?\u000a Because that's how you find out how much the sand is holding.\u000a That's how you find out how much the sand is holding? How did you know to start with 40?\u000a Because we poured 40 milliliters of water in the cup to start.\u000a Oh. To start, you poured 40 milliliters of water in. You took the water that you had to start and took away the amount that was left, which you got 11 milliliters. Very good. Excellent. Gentlemen, what are you noticing about sand and water?\u000a  We're noticing, about the sand, this time it took us two minutes and eight seconds for it to stop dripping. We started out with 40 milliliters and...\u000a What did you do with that 40 milliliters of water?\u000a We poured it into the strainer to drain it down into the cup and when we poured into the cylinder we had 28 and a half milliliters.\u000a Very good. How do you figure out how much water is in the sand. What subtraction sentence would you do?\u000a Forty minus 30.\u000a So you're rounding up. You said you had to 30?\u000a Yes.\u000a That's a very good choice. You're going to do 40 minus 30 so that tells you how much water is in the sand, which is?\u000a One, 10.\u000a Ten what?\u000a Milliliters.\u000a Ten milliliters. Very good. Do you think some of that water's still in the funnel? Because this funnel is still dry. This funnel feels wet. Do you think some of that 10 milliliters of water is in this... not funnel, in this filter?\u000a Yes.\u000a Do you think so? Why do you think that?\u000a Because it's soaked and some of the water might have stopped in there because it was so thick and sandy.\u000a And now it's a little bit thinner? Keep up the great work.  Sam and Madison, what are you noticing about water with your sand and water with your clay?\u000a  The sand drains the water faster than the clay.\u000a The sand drains the water faster than the clay. Have you figured out yet which one holds more water?\u000a Clay.\u000a The clay holds more water. If you were a gardener and if you were planting a garden, what would you rather garden with? Would you rather garden with sand or would you rather garden with clay?\u000a Sand.\u000a Why's that?\u000a Because it drains water better and the drainage would get to the plants faster.\u000a Okay. So the drainage would get to the plants faster. Where do the plants need the water?\u000a Roots.\u000a At the roots. What do you think, Madison?\u000a  I would do a mixture of sand, clay, and humus because mixed together it's loamy and loamy soil is good for the plants.\u000a Great observation. That's wonderful. So you said you'd mix all of them together because that would make a loamy mixture which would allow the gardeners to get the best soil for the plants to grow. Very good. Nice job. What are you three noticing about water and sand and water and clay?\u000a  Water and sand, it can absorb through the sand, the water. And through the clay it soaks and  at four minutes.\u000a You're almost at four minutes for your clay. Wow. What do you think this shows you about what happens on a rainy day whether it's outside in our soccer field? Or what happens on a rainy day in your backyard? Does anybody want to tell me what happens?\u000a The clay, it gets very muddy because the water is pouring down on it. It might make a puddle because some of the soil on the ground can't hold itself so it might make a puddle.\u000a Good. So Matthew, when you poured your water into your clay, did you have a puddle at the top of your clay?\u000a  Yeah, we had a puddle at the top of our clay because it was leaking little drops and it stayed on top of the clay. We had to wait a long time till we could pour more water.\u000a What stayed for a long time on top of the clay?\u000a The water did because it didn't have small particle sizes so it was hard for the water to get through.\u000a Oh, so the clay has small particle sizes so it's hard for the water to get through. Wow. Good job. What does that mean about the particle size for the sand?\u000a It means that the particle for sand is bigger and it has more space for the water to drain through.\u000a Good. Excellent. Did any of you draw diagrams of what your experiment set-up looked like?\u000a What it looked like?\u000a I think you have a diagram on the previous page. Did you draw a diagram?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay. What did your diagram show?\u000a My diagram, for sand, shows that the water is going right through the funnel and it's pouring to the bottom. And for my clay it's little drops because the clay is stuck together once it has water.\u000a Good. I can easily tell, in your diagram, which one's sand and which one's clay. One suggestion that I can make to you, though, is I would like a few more labels. If I were to never see this experiment before, how would I know that this is sand and that this is clay? So if you could label those for me and tell me what these drops are. I don't know if they're water, or  or milk. If you could do a little bit more labelling for me, that would be excellent. Good job. Nice work. Very impressive.  How long are you guys up to for your water being through your filter, through your clay?\u000a  Five minutes and 45 seconds.\u000a Five minutes and 45 seconds. I can tell that both of you are working very hard. And Xavier, you're doing excellent job at staying in your seat the whole time. You can give yourself a point right now for being on task. Nice job. Good. What are you noticing about sand, clay and water?\u000a  I noticed that the clay held less water than the sand and I was really surprised by that because I thought that water can go through sand fast.\u000a So you were really surprised because you didn't think water would go through sand that fast? And how much water did your sand hold?\u000a Our sand held 11 milliliters.\u000a Eleven milliliters. Good. And how much did your clay hold, do you know?\u000a  Five.\u000a Held five milliliters. Wow. What number sentence did you do in order to figure out how many milliliters were in the clay and how many milliliters were in the sand?\u000a We did 40 minus however the milliliters were left in the cup.\u000a Okay. And why did you do that?\u000a Because we had 40 to begin with and we needed to find out how many were left and... I forgot.\u000a You forgot? Kendall, can you help her out?\u000a We got 29 in this and it began with 40. So we had to do 40 minus 29. Forty minus 29 is 11 millimeters.\u000a Milliliters. Good. Remember millimeters is when we're using rulers and milliliters is when we're measuring water. Okay? Excellent job. Which soil would you rather garden with? Would you rather garden with sand or would you rather garden with clay?\u000a I would garden with both of them so I could get a  loamy soil and loamy soils are better for the flowers.\u000a Okay. So you would mix them together so that you could get a loamy mixture. What about you, Kendall?\u000a I would do sand because water can get through it easily.\u000a So water can get through it easily? Why would that matter?\u000a Because the soil and everything else, and the grass and everything, needs water but if you use clay it just stays on top and it can't get water.\u000a Very good. Excellent. Looks like you girls are ready to move on to your graphing. What are we going to graph? What are we graphing today?\u000a How much water is in the...\u000a

VNFL Yeah... So here's like... you can see that the professional players who  can pay that money. They're really rich, so there's so much sponsors  that they pay for their helmets. But like in... high school football what they want is long pass  cheaper material So they don't  care much about The health about the guys,  they want to go just... Their problem is  the money of the helmets. How much cost of helmet is... like helmets with  Kevlar or that stuff. like they use in  the military equipment.  So how can we combine your thoughts and your thoughts so that we can  save these thoughts? So what kind of  ideas you guys have? How could you design a helmet so it's not this big or really neat and super expensive? The type of padding we use So what ideas  do you guys have? So what kind of...  So you play football... What kind of padding right  now is inside of the helmet? I mean they're not soft. It's like it's air glove. It's almost like a hard  balloon stuck to your head. So it's just one on the side  and the whole top is full. and one on the other side  and one in the back. But that's it. I mean, you could  actually feel the hit. But it... you just  don't get a concussion, unless you're heavy. So have  you ever been hit? Have you ever had  a helmet to helmet contact? So where did you get hit? My head Almost like right here. On top of your head.\u000aRight, but there's padding there. Oh, but you said  you could still feel it. I mean, I could feel it for like  a quick couple of seconds or so. Then it just goes away. It's because of  the padding, I guess. It's... umm... It's like  So is there any  way that you would change the design of the  helmet that you have now? Um...more cushion. Okay. So that's  kind of going back to what Angel was talking about. So how can  we change the design to make it more cushiony, but... Because if you have  something that's too cushiony, right, is that going  to decrease the time? or increase the time  and decrease the force? if it's really cushiony? Oh, that's really cushiony? \u000aYeah Oh, you mean  like it will just go... Yeah.\u000aNo. Right. So you're saying  you want it more cushiony, you're saying you want it cheaper,  you're saying you want it smaller. I think like what Matt's kind of saying is more  for comfort than for safety. -Right. Right. So why... So can you relate sort of to what  Angel's saying and why if it is more cushiony it would be more dangerous. Umm, with the head rattling? Like if it hits on this side,  it's quicker to hit the other side. Is that what you mean? what? So how...? So think about how  the padding is right now. How it's stiff compared to something  that kind of gave. So think about  relating this back to force times the change in time. You can ask... If it's built too soft, it's  going to hit you with a stronger force... So what could  happen to the time? It's going to be slower, it's going to be faster. It's going to be faster, so what's  going to happen to the force? The force is going to increase...  So it's going to hurt even more and it will  be more dangerous. So what you need is like a stable material that not too soft, but at the same time So besides Kevlar, which you brought up which is I was thinking like  like for example  when you are hit and you're hit you want that like bulletproof  that the force spreads in  all the space of the body of the helmet. So is you are hit here, all the force is not concentrated in this place,  but is moving over all the helmet. So it displaces the  force so it's not on one area. So I was like  thinking like maybe like this big, the helmet then in the middle like like a wave like when it hits,  it spreads to all the helmet. So that's you versus less  you spread all the  force on your head so you have like less  Something that will  transfer the motion Yeah. I like this idea. But what I was thinking is that we could put layers so instead of hitting the helmet right away you hit something cushiony first so have something  cushiony on the outside so that it takes time  for you to hit the helmet. And once you hit the  helmet, the small cushiony so that it takes  time for that to hit the other hard part which would then hit cushion again  and then hit you. So kind of  like an atmosphere. Yeah, it will have  like little layers It will probably have to make  the helmet a little bit like bigger. But not like...  Don't make it like huge, but have layers on there. and then incorporate his idea  when you're making waves. So something  like that first layer could help  dissipate the force. So we have cushiony  against cushiony like boxers use. And then they have the  hard part on the bottom when they do little wrapping. So we have the cushiony part first. So it's going to take time and  I think that's what they use. They put cushion on there, so that it takes time for you  to actually feel the force. So that the force will be less. And if you have  cushion with cushion It's because you  are increasing the time. Yeah, because if you have two  helmets that are hitting each other, that are cushion and cushion, it will take longer for  them to hit each other. And then the force  will be decreased. My question for Matt is-  How big is the helmet? Oh! The padding? It's like thick.  It's kind of thick. That's just the padding  and then you have the helmet, which is like that  much more. -Yeah. It's like that thick. How heavy is the helmet? Like when you're wearing it,  does it feeling like it's weighing you down? Yeah, it takes time to get used to it.  And that day, you're neck will hurt. That's how heavy it is. Another version of like  what we are trying to do. I think it'd also be cool. Maybe like helmet  were like it was fitted to like the head and then it'd have like inbetween kind of like a net structure. which is a part of uh... kind of like what he had but something that is hung. I want to kind of  imagine it like the bridges. How they have like a whole bunch of  little columns But just a whole bunch that is attached to the  outside of the helmet. I will draw it, and I'll show you guys. You had your hand up, do you want  to share while he...? Yeah I was wondering, since  we're talking about the injuries and can you guys give an example of the  type of brain damage that you can get? Just like an actual name. Like I heard concussion. Other injuries, other names. Can you tell... What a concussion is? What is a concussion? Ask the group. Well, a concussion is when... It's when you... your brain between your  actual brain and your skull There is a liquid,  like Spinal fluid, is it? and that's supposed  to cushion your brain from touching the, or hitting, your skull. But a concussion is when it's  hitting and it's going back and forth. I mean gradually it will go back to normal but... That's my understanding  of concussion. And you would have lost like feeling for like one or two seconds on the biggest  areas of the impact So what part do you think  is the most dangerous part to hit of your brain,  on your brain? The sides. What do the sides control? Well, it wasn't like that. I thinking like in  the structure of the... of the skull. So the sides, where  the nerves enter, like Your optic nerves?-Yeah. So I think that's like less pain. It's like a really big hit here   can kill a man. So I think that hit is worst. You're saying the skull  is thinnest right there? -Yeah. It's not as thick  as the other parts. It's thickest, like right here... What does your  frontal lobe control? So that's what  kind of separates us from other species is that we have the most  developed frontal lobe. And then on the sides is  more of your sensory stuff. and then in the back is your actually your Occipital lobe for your eyes is in  the back, a long with your movement,  your cerebellum. So different spots,  that's why you have padding here, and  here and back here, is to protect all sides of the brain. So a concussion is just like your  brain keeps vibrating, basically, after the blow? So I like to think about it, and I meant to bring this in  and I apologize. So if you have...  Think about your Tupperware. and inside the  Tupperware you have an egg. You just cracked  a nice egg inside and then you shake it. So imagine  that egg is your brain. And that Tupperware is your skull. So the harder you rattle it,  what's going to happen to the egg? It will break. It's gonna break, right? The yolk's going to break, right? I mean your brain doesn't really break. But you can think that It's just kind  of the movement. Because if you think about  what does Newton's first law say? An object that's in motion will stay in motion  unless acted upon by outside force. So if the brain... If you get hit here, which way is your  brain going to go? That way. Until it hits the  skull and then it's going to *thunk* So that's what they  call rattling your cage. I was thinking of like  when I play baseball, when I swing the  bat and I hit the ball, and my hands keep like, I can feel it inside and like even after  a minute it will keep rattling. So now take that  and think about how that would... Okay! So David, can you uh... Explain what you  have so we can... This is kind of like the bridge  idea that I had where like there's like different columns that go around, like the frame. So in this, it would kind of be like,  the head goes right here and the helmet's right here. And these would be like some kind of material that's bendable. So, when something  hits it, they would bend in so, to absorb kind of the impact. Kind of like a cage  in the racing cars. Like how racing cars have a cage inside of them. Just in case they roll over,  the cage still protects the person. Yeah kind of... No, but... Yeah kind of like that  but these are like cushions. Yeah. So they  absorb the momentum. So like a coil? Like for your bed.  The bed spring that when you jump up on it,  you rebound back, so... Wouldn't that be  more dangerous if it's...? elastic? Yeah, it's elastic, and when we did the little  cars When it was elastic,  it completely transferred all of its momentum  to the other car. So when you get hit,  it will just like swing and then all the  momentum will hit you. instead of both  of you sharing it. So if you share,  it'd probably be better. But I don't know if that's...  Because I was also  thinking of mattresses. A little sleep mattresses. and how they talked about the coils  and how they give you pressure points and it will be stronger  over here than over here. and then they have the new  ones now that are like foam. The Tempurpedic ones, Yeah. So I was thinking also   if you like spread out... where the momentum goes. Saying if you spread out where  it won't be in one certain area. Then you won't get hit  really hard right here. And if you get hit  hard like over here, it'd probably be better  than getting hit hard just right there. -Yeah. It will probably  be less of a force. So when they  design like a helmet, they've got one piece thing  where it's like your body their shoulder pads  connected to their helmet. So your body absorbs some of  that too, instead of just your head. So that depends  how you turn your head And would it be  good if your body... have you guys ever heard that people who  are like drunk drivers they kind of walk  away from a car crash and it's the passengers or the victims are the ones  that get hurt the most... So think about what's different between their body in motion and  the other person's body in motion. So they're looser, right? They're not tightening their muscles  compared to someone who is trying to absorb the impact. We flex, right?  Just waiting for it, and  so, by being more rigid your body doesn't move. You're trying to  fight against the motion. So you get more of the whiplash and stuff like that. Because you...  It hurt your body more because you're  trying to fight against what you're body is  actually going to do instead of the other person  who's just like really loose is moving with it, so there's not as much impact. Well, I've been playing football and how you play like you want to win. You hit someone you want to. After that you're still going and if you are like losing the other person is stronger than you can beat you up like... I know. What he  is saying is like if you see someone  about to collide with you, you want to hit  him back instead of... Yeah. Why is that?  Related that to momentum. Because momentum  is vector, right? So you have to think  about the direction and of the way  that things are moving. So think back to... When we were playing  with different cars. So you had the greater mass  in one car going this way. And had the smaller  mass going this way. Right? So what would you want to  do to the smaller mass car to make sure that the impact of the.... Raise his speed Increase the speed, right? And so by knowing that  you're going to get hit you're going to  run a little faster. So then what was the... what is the ending result there? So like if you have more speed you hit the other object that has more mass Mean like....  how do you think is like... Inelastic, I don't know, like So what's going to happen? Are they going to  stay stuck together?  So it's elastic so it comes off, right? Think about it  like a rubber band, an elastic rubber band. You can stretch it, so... elastic is, is saying, something  that's going to rebound. whereas inelastic  you're just rigid. There is no motion,  I guess, you should say. I thought that was inelastic, when you  hit something, it will both go off completely and  elastic it will stick together. And inelastics magnets.\u000a

V Spanish, and you would know if, I mean, you would know what they're saying because you learn English, and you talk, you learn English and you know how to talk Spanish.\u000a  I agree with you, because like, because like if they when you said that they had to read, write, and speak English, like they put something that, they put something that's English on your paper, you'd probably understand it more, so that's why I agree with you.\u000a  But when they fill out the application, what if the application didn't \u000a Well,\u000a  The application is about like where you're from, why are you coming here for, like they want to know a lot of information about you.\u000a  I think we should, I think we should keep it at one, because if you fill out the application, you'll know more about people, and their birthday and stuff, like and then they usually bring them a present, \u000a Okay, so it's important to know about somebody. Now, the citizenship board might not go to their birthday party, but it is important to know when their birthday is, right? Okay, what were you saying, Ariel?\u000a I think he must fill out an application, because...\u000a  I think you should fill out an application so you can, so if you come to America, you can... If you come to America, they'll know when your birthday, where did you come from and stuff.\u000a  Yeah, it's important to have that information. Why do you think we need to know where they came from?\u000a  Because I think they wanted to know where they came from, because like if they came from a bad city, and they want to come to like a good city, and--\u000a A city or a country?\u000a A country.\u000a A country, okay.\u000a If they came from a bad country, and they wanted to join a good country, then you want to see like, they want to see like if they got like \u000a  If they were bad, like where they came from, that would be, yeah, they'd have to know that.\u000a I think I would be  because like when they, like different countries have different holidays, so when they be out, like they be out celebrating, then nobody won't think nothing's wrong with it, because they're celebrating, and they don't know that on this day, that's when they're celebrating their country.\u000a I didn't even think about that. We need to know about their culture, so that we can let them celebrate. That's important, too. Great conversation. So we're gonna keep that one or get rid of it?\u000a We're gonna keep it.\u000a Okay. So let's move onto the next step and see what you think about the next one.\u000a That you have to live in the US, United States, for five years.\u000a  I don't believe that you have to live in the United States for five years, because like if you're like, I'm  five years, if you're married, you're going to have to live for three years, but then like the reason why you should live in it five years, because like you could get used to the country and everything, that's what I think.\u000a  I think that you should live in America for five years if you come from somewhere else, because like some people, they come here, and they see that they don't like it, and they try to move back to where they came from, and when they try to move back, somebody already took their house or something, and if they go, they ain't gonna have no money to come back because they're just gonna be outside homeless.\u000a I think there will be some changes to live in the US. Two years, because if you're real old, if you're old, then they say that you might die in a couple years, then if you're staying here, if you have to stay here to become a citizen for five years, then it takes longer, then you wouldn't get the chances to make choices before you die.\u000a  I think you should change, you have to live in the US, United States, for five years, because what if if the house is dirty, and it's not clean? Like if it's like the tub still got stains in it \u000a  Explain that a little bit more to me. So you said that you would change it to how many years?\u000a  To one year.\u000a To one year, becase if you got in a house that was dirty, you might want to do what?\u000a  If the walls was still had stains on it--\u000a Well what would you want to do then?\u000a Move.\u000a Okay, where would you move? Still in the United States, or back to your country?\u000a  Still in the United States.\u000a Okay, so you would still be there, so would you want to just stay, even though you move from place to place--\u000a  I will--\u000a Do you think you would change the number of years they're gonna be in the United States, or just not make them stay in the same place?\u000a Not make them stay in the same place.\u000a Okay, so we need to make sure that Ariel knows, do we have to stay in the same place for all five years?\u000a No, not really.\u000a No, okay.\u000a  I think that if they I think that they should give them at least one year to figure out if they want to stay in that home or go back to where they used to live. So I mean, if they don't like it on the first day, so they won't have to go back again, come back to see, or come back, somebody else at your house. At your old house.\u000a  I disagree with you, and I agree with you. The reason why I disagree with you, because they said still living three years just like if you're married, and I agree with you, because like when you said that they come from the first place, I mean, the first day they may not like it, and they could probably go back where they came from, that's why I disagree and agree with you.\u000a  Okay, I think we should change it so if they look at their choice to go back to their home country for like two months, because then they'll miss their family members, then like when a couple days in their country, and nobody was doing it in America, then they could just go back to their country for like a month or something.\u000a  So maybe you guys need to discuss how many years they should stay here in America, and maybe if they could, how long they could go to visit their relatives in other countries. Although I think those are all good things to keep discussing. So maybe make that decision on how many years, and then move onto the next one and I'll come back and see you.\u000a  Here, but you you trying to become a citizen here, but you like want to, like you're trying to vote, like say if you lived in Germany, you're trying to go back to Germany. You can't, that's not being loyal to the US, because you're trying to become a citizen to the US, and you're trying to go back, if you was living in Germany, you're trying to go back to Germany. What do you think, guys?\u000a Well,  because they have to want to say that, A, if you don't, then they won't have to send you back, because you have to be community and jobs so they can get you jobs and what to do and--\u000a  I think that we should keep the rule, because say if your old country got in a war, you would say you tried to take up them, and you're already trying to become a citizen of the USA, and you take up for your old country, that makes you not become a citizen.\u000a That don't mean if you're born in your like regular country, that don't mean like you can go back, go back and forth and take up for them, and then when we're having a war, you want to take up for us, you can't do that. You can't like, if you grew up in Germany, you can't take up for Germany, because you'e trying to be a citizen in the US now. You can't take up for Germany, even though you were born there. You got to take up for the US.\u000a  Do you think that's hard for someone who came to the United States to forget about their old country? Woudl that be difficult?\u000a  Yeah. In my opinion, I think that'd be difficullt because like with me, I can make a connection because when I went, when I had, when I used to live with my grandma, me and my momma, we used to live with my grandma, and I couldn't forget about the things that I did at my grandma's house, so my grandma and my cousins, but we still were around, but I couldn't stop, I couldn't forget about what the fun things that we did.\u000a  Yeah, \u000a  So what should we put here?\u000a  Well, I think we should keep it, because like you can't go back to your like regular country to do like, like you can't fight for the army, the army, they're trying to stay here to protect us, and you're already trying to become a citizen for the US. You can't like go back to Germany.\u000a  Then we should keep that, because then so we should learn how to be nice? I don't know.\u000a  Like, we could put, so that if like you grew up in Germany, you can't fight for Germany. So we're gonna put that.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  You have to be true to the US.\u000a Be true to the US.\u000a  How about the next one that says, "Have good moral character." Is that one that you would keep or get rid of?\u000a  Get rid of. In my opinion, I'd get rid of that, because people, like that's like, that's like having like you gotta be like nice to people. Some people, they can't take it. Like, they can't take that, they can't like, people, like I can make a connection because my cousin, she got like ups and downs, because when people, they just like irritate her, and they be aggravating her, she can't take it no more, she just like, she just gotta get mad and stuff. Like people, they can't take having a moral character. Like my cousin, she can't do that because people, they be like bullying her and stuff, and she can't like keep like, she can't keep on standing right there and people keep on bullying her.\u000a  Brittany, do you think we should keep it or leave it?\u000a  I think we should, I think we should get rid of it. When I was in the suburbs with my godmother, she said that my godbrother was getting picked on in school by a bully, and he just felt like beating him up. What do you think, Adune?\u000a Well, keep it, because like, why would you let some  people get away with most of that stuff? You're just gonna let them keep doing the same thing? And without the rule? Without that rule, everybody, people would just keep getting beat \u000a  So what I hear all of you saying is that you don't want people to get beaten, but you also said that sometimes it's hard to control your anger, so you can't, you're not always a good person all the time. Sometimes you make bad choices. Do you think we could maybe change that rule so that everybody would be happy with it?\u000a  Yes, I think we should change it to like, like, when you're like around like older people, like elder, like older people, and like they're real old, you can like, like you can show like good moral character around them, but then when they like go and stuff, like when they're not gone, like when we was talking about immigrants on the, like they was on the boats, you don't know what type of people is on the boats. It can be like elder people, you never know. Like you can have good moral character around them, but like when you like, when you're like around your mother, don't she want you to respect you? Don't she want you to respect her?\u000a  But, we should change the rule to like sometimes people can just like have a chance to get some people back that really did something really bad to them, or caused them to get hurt or something, so we should change the rule to like, it's kind of like hard for a name, but we should think about it.\u000a  I think, I have a cause and effect for a good moral character. That's why they have like, if you have to fill out an application, that's why they're trying to like, that's why they're trying to like fill out an application to see if you got good moral character, or if you're cra--\u000a

V One eighth plus one eighth is \u000a Oh, one eighth, okay. Is she adding one eighth together a bunch of times? Where do you see that? Can you come up and show us?\u000a You have to get seven of them.\u000a Okay. Katriana could you add that number sentence up above your picture also? So I like how you're all thinking while she's writing this. There's a couple different ways we can represent this. I think Anielli and lots a groups had their hand up were right that she did. I can see she took seven pizzas and divided it into eight pieces for eight people. And I also see where, and when I talk to Katriana, she said, "Well I got one eighth, plus one eighth, and one eighth, and one eighth and one eighth. How much is that gonna add up to equal? She's got one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth.\u000a Seven eighths.\u000a Seven eighths, okay. And that's how much pizza she told us. What about seven divided by eight? A bunch a groups kept their hand down after Anielli shared that number sentence. But it's not a complete number sentence until we can finish that equation. What would seven divided by eight come out to equal do you think? Talk at your group for just a minute again I think we're just a little bit unsure. \u000a What are you thinkin' for seven divided by eight?  Let's come talk it over with this group. You check with this group, I'll check with this group. What are ya'll thinkin' up here?  Well, what do you see in her representation?  You see how many pizza's?  Okay, seven pizzas.\u000a Eight people.\u000a And eight people.  Did she divide those seven pizzas into eight groups? Okay, so we've just gotta figure out how much then, that's gonna come out to equal. I'm not sure. Talk about it as a group. You can draw it on the back. Okay. Yes, thank you, ma'am. Okay, thank you so much for talkin' with your group. What did you or someone at your group think again? If we've got seven pizzas divided by eight people. Katia?\u000a We've got 56 divided by eight because there's 56 pieces, and it's kinda .\u000a Okay, so you noticed there's and it's cut into...\u000a Eight.\u000a Eight slices. So you were thinking something a little bit differently. Savannah?\u000a We, I thought the same way except I thought that it was gonna be 56... Divided by seven. because... Each one of them is shaded in, and they're all going to  eight people.\u000a Okay.  Let me ask us all this. I love that we're relating this back thinking about some of our math facts, and how that can tie in and help us. But what did Katriana start with here? What do you think the first thing she did was?  What did she do, Steven?\u000a Drew seven or eight pizzas.\u000a Did she draw seven pizzas or eight pizzas?\u000a Seven.\u000a Seven pizzas. Is that what she did first? Okay.  She drew out her seven pizzas. So we wanna know, or we need to know that that's what she started with. What did she divide those pizzas into?\u000a Into eighths.\u000a Into eight. We see she cut 'em into eight pizzas. Brennan.\u000a I did  I was thinking either 700, or seven tenths.\u000a Okay.  So we're thinking back to fractions. I think since we don't have a definite answer, we don't need to yet. Let's leave this kinda open-ended, but I'm gonna circle it so that we remember to come back to it. So we've gotta a great number sentence that one thing Katriana did was add up one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, and she got seven eighths and we're gonna keep thinking about... I saw a bit of agreement that seven pizzas, she divided by eight people. But we need to figure out, ladies, how much that would mean each person gets. So put a big arrow. So as we continue let's keep that in our mind. Okay, thank you. Can I have... The person who put this one up in black. Faith, was that you? Will you come tell us what you did, and what you think the answer might be here. How much pizza each person got.\u000a Well, I knew there was eight soccer players, so there were seven pizzas, so I did seven pizzas. Then I divided six of 'em up in to fourths, and then I numbered 'em all. And then when I got to eight I started one, two, three, back over again when I got to another eight, I did it again but then I realized that there wasn't enough, or more, so I split the last pizza up into eighths and that equals up to eight people.\u000a Okay, and that equaled up to eight people. So how much pizza do you think each person gets?\u000a Well, I think that each person would get at least one fourth, and .\u000a Okay, so let's write this up here. So you said each person gets, let's put it up in black. How much? Like let's say person number 1. How much pizza do they get? Will you show us?\u000a They would get one, two, three... They would get three fourths.\u000a Okay.\u000a And then one eighth.\u000a Three fourths and one eighth. Like this? Okay, do you know how much that is all together?\u000a That would... That would equal up to four .\u000a Okay. So let's think about this one for a minute. Do you have any questions for Faith about how she figured this out? Okay, I think she did a great job explaining her picture. So she showed us where each person gets three fourths plus one eighth. Will you talk at your group? How much is that? How much is that total? Thank you, if you wanna join a group. Good explanation.  Okay, group what do we think?\u000a Four twelfths.\u000a You agree with her four twelfths? How did you come up with four twelfths?\u000a By adding those two together.\u000a How did you add them together?\u000a Three plus one would equal four, and then four would be the numerator because you added the two top numbers. And if you added the two bottom numbers, it would equal twelve for the denominator.\u000a Okay, so is there a picture, or is there a way that we could show this with pictures that that would come out to equal four twelfths? \u000a See, on the back of your paper once will you draw a representation of four twelfths?  How come?\u000a Because. I thought that if the denominators were different, we couldn't add them up directly.\u000a Oh.\u000a So, we tried to get the denominators the same.\u000a What do we call that?\u000a Equal to fractions .\u000a I like that your thinking back to remember your vocabulary.\u000a I tried to tell Katia that if it has a different number on the bottom then we're supposed to add the  on the bottom to--\u000a I don't know. Have we learned to do that before?\u000a Well no, but I just thought about it, and I've been practicing.\u000a Okay. So if we haven't learned it yet we've gotta think about how are we gonna figure it out, right? Okay, so keep thinking. It's okay that we're debating between a couple different answers just tryin' to explain to each other why you're thinking four twelfths, and why you're thinking something different.\u000a I thought it was  because... Whenever you add it up  And the denominator .\u000a Okay.  So I understand where you got the four slices. But what size are those slices? Would be my next question. Because we wanna make sure every soccer player gets the same amount 'cause I would be upset if I didn't get as much pizza as you did. I like pizza.  Okay. \u000a Okay, well it says four twelfths, so we're shading four--\u000a Do you have 12 pieces there?\u000a We have one, two, three--\u000a Okay. If I can have your attention back. I know some of you are still discussing, and doing a great job. But I wanna make sure that we've got time to get through the rest of our solutions before we're out of time for the day. Hailey, if I can have you close the door again for us. And can I hear what a couple of your groups came up with? I heard three or four different things as I was going around. Three fourths, Hannah said each person gets three fourths of a pizza and one eighth.\u000a Faith said.\u000a How much is that? Yes, I'm sorry, Faith said since ya'll sat next to each other I still mess that up. Three fourths and one eighth. How much did you or your group think that came out to be, Nathan?\u000a We came up with seven eighths.\u000a Seven eighths.\u000a Because when you take three fourths, and then you take another circle that shows one eighth, then you divide the three fourths into eighths, then add the  the ones that used to be three fourths and that equals seven eighths.\u000a Can you come up and show that to us? I think, I think I followed in my head, but did you all have trouble making that picture in your head?\u000a Yes.\u000a A little bit, yeah. Can you show us? You can draw it here, or over here we've got lots of room.\u000a Nathan, you're right. \u000a Shhh. Okay, let's see what he does. Okay, can you step to the... step to the side so everybody in the class can see you. There you go.\u000a And then if you divide that into eighths, then you add one of the eighths then you add this over here. It comes out to be seven eighths.\u000a Can I just get in.. agreement or disagreement somebody who had shared with us. What do you think about what he just did? I saw him draw three eighths at one pizza, and one, or three fourths of one pizza, and one eighth of the next. And then I saw him cut this one into eighths. How many eighths was three fourths? When you cut it? Six eighths. And then he put one more eighth over and seven eighths. What are you thinkin' about that, Brazy?\u000a I agree with him.\u000a Why?\u000a Because our group said that we know that four eighths is equal to... twelve fourths is equivalent to seven eighths, and his picture we can see that it's two and when he was workin' it out we could see that it was right and so I agree with him.\u000a Okay, Brennan?\u000a I agree with him, but I have a different explanation.\u000a Okay.\u000a One fourth is equal to two eighths, but then you take--\u000a Oh, I'm sorry. Let me write this as you're saying it so we can follow it. So you said...\u000a One fourth is equal to two eighths.\u000a Okay.\u000a So... We multiplied the three and the numerator with three fourths.\u000a Okay.\u000a By two, which comes from the two eighths and it would equal up to six eighths plus that one extra eighth it would be seven eighths.\u000a Okay, so you said three fourths is equivalent to\u000a Six eighths.\u000a Six eighths, okay.\u000a And then just add the other one, seven eighths.\u000a Okay, so then you did six eighths, plus one eighth, equals seven eighths, like that? Okay, can I just see a quick, on your remotes, do you agree or disagree with Nathan and Brennan? So, A is I agree. B I disagree, or I'm confused.\u000a What's confused?\u000a We'll just do A and B. A is I agree, I understand, or B is I disagree, or I'm confused. How are you feeling right now about what Brennan and Nathan just said? They're two different explanations. I just wanna see right now, do you agree or disagree with what Brennan and Nathan just said. And again they were saying that three fourths, plus one eighth is gonna come out to equal seven eighths. And they each kinda explained it a different way. One with words and one with a picture. Need a couple more people to vote if they agree or disagree. Number three, number eleven we need a vote from you please.  Where is remote number three? There it comes. Okay. What do we, what do we know by looking at this graph? What do we know by looking at this graph? Thomas?\u000a

V Three, two, one, stop. Okay, were there pairs of you who chose different things?\u000a Um hmm.\u000a And who wants to share?\u000a I said if I had to pick, I would pick the green cylinder because the white would overflow easy, the pink you would have to reach down far to get it.\u000a Okay, Devon?\u000a I would pick the pink one, because it's like thin enough to be like a cup, and you can do this with it. And it would be a lot easier than just like doing this, especially because if it gets on the bottom of the green one, it would be hard to get it, and the white one, it might spill if you walk around with it. Or you could trip.\u000a Okay, good. Layla?\u000a But, well, I agreed with Devon on the pink one, but I would rather have the white one because it could carry more popcorn, but it also is harder to hold, unless you were to like, since it has more area, the white one has more area than the pink or the green one.\u000a More area you're talking this way?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, so you're saying...\u000a You take the popcorn and you could like, you could make it even on the bottom of it, so it wouldn't necessarily be overflowing unless you were, when you walk, for the popcorn thing.\u000a Okay, all right. Brittany?\u000a Me and Lani had the same answer, we would think that, it sort of relates to what Devon said, if we picked the green one, because, and related to . The pink one's gonna be hard to reach down to get the rest of the popcorn. And the green one is wide enough, and it can hold, it can still hold as much popcorn as the pink one. But it's still gonna be hard to get down the pink one, and the white one's just gonna spill.\u000a Okay, all right.  Tiffany.\u000a We thought that the green and pink one, it doesn't matter because they're probably gonna hold the same capacity since they're the same shape, it's just one's taller and one's shorter, but the short one's wider and the tall one's skinnier, it's tall but we thought that both of them can hold the same.\u000a So you said either one of these two? It didn't matter, okay. Kylie?\u000a I would want the green cup because it's easier like to get your hand down it. The pink one looks like really skinny, so if you have big hands, it would be hard to get your hand down it.\u000a Okay, all right, Amani?\u000a I think the green one becuase when you look at it, the old popcorn container, and the green one, they're kinda the same, although the green one is a little bit bigger, so then you could get more.\u000a Okay.\u000a I said the green one also because the pink one is skinny, and it if went to the same size as that, with the same amount of popcorn, it would be less popcorn in the pink one than the green one. Do you know what I'm saying?\u000a Say that again.\u000a Okay, I picked the green one because, say you fill them with popcorn, and then you take all the popcorn that was in the pink one, and you put it in the green one, it's gonna be less popcorn in the green one than the pink one. And the white one, it's just gonna fall over 'cause it's too small, it's too flat.\u000a Okay, hold on Josh. Now, Tiffany said that she felt they held the same amount. Did you say that?\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a And why did you say that?\u000a Because they're the same size paper, except one, they're just folded different.\u000a Okay, she said that because they're the same size paper, they're folded differently, but she thinks that they're gonna hold the same amount. And you are disagreeing.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a Okay, she's disagreeing, saying that the green one's going to hold more, is that correct? What you said?\u000a I said, yeah, the green one would hold more.\u000a Okay, Josh what do you think?\u000a I said I would rather have the green because it would be a lot easier to get the popcorn out, and because it might have more volume than those two. Yeah.\u000a Okay, so let's change our thinking here. Some of you did think about which one is going to hold more. It didn't matter whether your hand could get easier into this one, or Devon liked this one 'cause he could tilt it up, he didn't even have to have his hand in it at all, which is an interesting way to look at it. A lot of you said you didn't like this one because it would spill easily or whatnot. Yes ma'am?\u000a But unless you did what I suggested, and you like evened it out on the bottom.\u000a Yes, because you said you liked this one, 'cause you thought it held more than the other two.\u000a But you'd have to like flat, not necessarily like, squish the popcorn so it's flat, you'd have to like shake things sideways, so that it would even it out. Like food in a pan, you would shake it to even it out on the bottom.\u000a Okay, all right.\u000a Well it's kinda like with the little kid packs, there are things shaped like that, and it has like, gummies and popcorn in it, and I don't like it 'cause like, everyone would get the other ones, it would have like more popcorn in it.\u000a Okay, Tiffany?\u000a What I would suggest the white one is like, even it's the same shape as the other two pieces of paper, but it's folded so it's taking less up space, but it's folded.\u000a Because it overlaps here, it does overlap here, with the white, you're right there.\u000a But I disagree with Molly because the popcorn amount that's inside of the, inside the square ones at Newtown, is the same amount as one of the plastic ones. The exact same amount of popcorn, 'cause they actually use those as measuring cups. I've watched them do it. And I've watched them actually use those cups, those hard ones, to fill the other cup, to fill the other ones.\u000a So you think that this is going to hold the same amount as this?\u000a All of them are gonna hold the same amount because they used the hard plastic ones, as measuring cups.\u000a All right, Devon.\u000a I agree with Layla, like they're all the same. I think it just depends on like who you are, kind of, like which one you want.\u000a Okay, but do you think it would be unfair to say a certain gender would have to have each one?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So if you could choose, that would be a good thing. Right, hold on a second, let's move on a second, and I'm gonna have MK come up here and help me. We're gonna see if they hold the same, okay? I want you, however, on your paper, to write down, you know, which one you think holds the most, do they hold the same, or if you think they hold a different amount, put 'em in order, like which one is least, middle greatest, why don't you do that real quick. Why don't you put 'em in order, which one do you think? Okay, this is what she thinks, she thinks least, middle greatest. Here's what we're going to do. I do not have popcorn, but I do have cereal. And hopefully, hopefully, MK can pour this. Hopefully, okay, so you're, I'm gonna hold it. Or would you rather hold it and me pour?\u000a Wait, yeah, you might wanna pour it.\u000a Okay, and just make sure that the bottom stays. Okay. We are smellin' the sugar up here!\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, can you all see that it's at the top?\u000a Yeah. All right. Now, what we are going to do, so this is, this would be a full thing of popcorn for the girls. We're gonna put this over top, and you're gonna lift it up and see what happens. And some of you have predicted that it's going to be the same, right? How many have predicted that they're all the same? All the same? Okay. How many are predicting that the green is bigger? Predicting that the green is bigger? Okay.  What about the white is biggest? Anybody predict the white is biggest? Okay, why don't you lift this up, I'll hold this this time. You gotta make sure that.\u000a Pink's bigger.\u000a Ooh!\u000a Can you see? Can you see? So there's more room, right? There's more room in the green one. Why?\u000a Because the more space it has, the bigger around it is, the more cereal that could fit in it.\u000a So what is that called, around here?\u000a Circumference?\u000a Well this is circumference, but at the bottom.\u000a Volume?\u000a It is volume, 'cause we're measuring volume. But what is at the bottom of this.\u000a Base?\u000a A base, is that what you're saying? That the base, it depends on how big the base is? Well let's look to see whether it'll fit in here. Okay.\u000a There it is. Exact same room as the pink.\u000a Well, do you think there's the exact same room as the pink?\u000a No.\u000a I think the white has more.\u000a You think the white could fit more?\u000a Yeah. Okay, thank you MK, have a seat. But what do we know about this one now?\u000a It's the smallest.\u000a It's the smallest.\u000a Do you think we could come up with a formula to figure out what the numbers are here, and figure out what the formula, or the volume is?\u000a Like the length of it, the length of the pink one?\u000a Does anybody know what a standard size sheet of paper measures?\u000a Eight by\u000a Is it eight by 12?\u000a Eight by 12, eight by six?\u000a Eight by 10?\u000a Eight by 10? Eight by 10?\u000a A foot?\u000a A foot?\u000a Eight by 11.\u000a Okay, it is actually eight and a half by 11, okay? Eight and a half, by 11. So our standard size paper is eight and a half by 11. Okay? So for our pink one. What is, when we do this. What is this?\u000a The circumference?\u000a Its' the circumference. What do we know about the circumference then, for the pink one?\u000a That it's 8.5.\u000a It is 8.5. So circumference equals what?\u000a 8.5.\u000a The circumference equals 8.5. Are we then able to find out the diameter and the radius if we have the circumference?\u000a Yes.\u000a No.\u000a You say yes?\u000a Yeah, I know what you could do, you could divide it by 3.14 'cause that's how you get, 'cause you know how it's the opposite of times, so that you would do it, and you would divide that by 8.4, no, 3.14, and then you'll have the diameter, and then you can just take half of that, and that'd be the radius.\u000a Okay, all right, tell me Brittany, what is the formula for circumference?\u000a Pi times d?\u000a Circumference equals pi times d. I'm gonna ask someone to restate what Kiki said. Does anyone agree with Kiki?\u000a Yes, I do.\u000a And what did she say?\u000a She said that you can divide the circumference by 3.14.\u000a Okay.  So we know the circumference is 8.5, correct? And we know that pi is what, Molly?\u000a 3.14.\u000a 3.14, and we're trying to find the, the what, Devon?\u000a Diameter?\u000a The diameter, okay? So both Kiki and Maya say you divide by 3.14. Is that what we do? Treyshawn?\u000a Yes.\u000a So if I divide this side by 3.14, and I divide this side by 3.14, what happens to this right here, India?\u000a It would get smaller.\u000a It gets smaller.\u000a Yes, if you divide it.\u000a Okay, what is 3.14 divided by 3.14?\u000a One.\u000a Sure. \u000a

V\u000a What if it comes from like a polluted creek or something, or some kind of bad water system in the ground?\u000a Number three... .\u000a I say crystal clear and filtered.\u000a I said how dirty the water gets.\u000a How good the water is for you?\u000a\u000a It doesn't have stuff dying in it, it's crystal clear and it doesn't smell.\u000a  Okay, class, if we can pull back together please, as a group, I was hearing excellent discussions between each of the three questions, and I think we have some very valuable points to go ahead and talk about. So, what we're gonna do is kind of create a little bit of a list up here, to help us remind later when I go to show you something. So, we're gonna start again with that first question, and I'm looking for you to participate and share some of those questions together. So, it says again, how do you know if water is safe or not? And I heard wonderful responses, so can I hear some of those please? Brandon, please start us.\u000a Color and odor.\u000a  Okay, so you know if water is safe or not depending on again, the color and the odor. Good, what are some other responses? Brandon?\u000a Remember where you got it from. Like, if it was in a creek that looks fine, it's probably safe to drink, but if it's from a polluted creek that has a really weird color to it, or it's in a weird location, don't drink it.\u000a Okay, so I'm commenting here, I have, it depends on the source you're getting it from, and so if it's a creek that looks to be clean or clear, then you know it's probably okay? And if it looks to have like a weird color, I think you mentioned again to it, or polluted or in a weird location, then maybe it's not safe. All right, what were some of your other responses? Jack.\u000a Um, if it goes through a quality filter?\u000a Okay, if it goes through a quality filter. And Jack, can you maybe think of an example of a quality filter?\u000a A Culligan filter for the drinking water?\u000a Okay, so a Culligan filter that you can use to filter out the water. Okay, good. Madeline?\u000a There's no large pieces of trash or anything in the water?\u000a  Okay, so you can look for visible signs of large trash, and Madeline, what was the second part of that?\u000a Nothing that looks unnatural in it.\u000a  Okay, so nothing that looks unnatural. Great. Anybody else, any answers for number one? Again, how do you know if it's safe or not? Lexi, I think you had another answer that may have been covered up here. What did you say when I was talking with your group about... ?\u000a The smell?\u000a  Okay, the smell, again, the odor of it. Okay, great. Brandon, you thought of another one?\u000a If there's something dead in it.\u000a  If there's something dead in it, so again, we're going based on those visual aspects of it. Good. Well, we're gonna come back to that here in just a moment, so we'll move on to number two. When are times when the water might not be safe? Walker?\u000a After an earthquake or another disaster?\u000a  Okay, so after an earthquake. And Walker, can I have you expand a little bit? What would be so significant after an earthquake or another disaster that would make the water not safe?\u000a Because maybe something fell in the water, or, I don't know, I just heard that before.\u000a  Okay, so you heard it before, and if something fell in the water. Did you happen to see at all, in Japan after the tsunami came through there? Do you remember any of those images?\u000a Yeah kinda, they were different colors and yeah...\u000a  Okay, and I think I heard somebody else say that they remembered seeing a point that maybe we can add onto. Elvis?\u000a  At the beach.\u000a  At the beach? What do you mean by "at the beach?"\u000a There's different times where the water might not be safe.\u000a  Okay, can you think of a specific example, like have you experienced a time when you weren't allowed to be at the beach?\u000a When somethings dangerous in the water.\u000a  Okay, if something's dangerous in the water. Sometimes they might tell you that it's not safe to be there. Okay. Any other times that might make the water not safe? Amelia, can you think of any times where the water might not be safe?\u000a I have, after storms, like um, Walker did.\u000a  Okay, what are some things then, because this is something I'm hearing so far. What are some things after the storm that might be in the water besides, I think you said some stuff can fall in the water. What are some of the things that might be in the water that would make it not safe? Aashi, can you think of something that might get in the water?\u000a Um, like tree branches or animals?\u000a  Okay, so tree branches and animals, that's good. Can you think of anything else that might get in the water that maybe wouldn't normally be there? Kris?\u000a Trash?\u000a  Trash, okay. Can you think of a specific kind of trash? Lexi?\u000a Glass?\u000a  Glass. And what would be the danger of glass getting in the water?\u000a It's sharp and can cut yourself.\u000a  Okay, so there's a chance of getting injured if you cut yourself. What else... think outside the box a little bit more. What else could get in the water that you would not normally want in your water? Madeline?\u000a Plastic bags and then you can suffocate animals.\u000a  Okay, so plastic bags that they suffocate animals, something along those lines. Elvis?\u000a Oil and gasoline?\u000a  Oil and gasoline, good. Brandon?\u000a Toxins.\u000a  Toxins, okay. Jack?\u000a Plastic six-pack holders? Because it strangles the fish and everything.\u000a  Okay, now lets think... I'm glad you guys are all concerned about the fish and the animals and all of that, but what about we as humans, can you think of anything that would get in the water that would be potentially harmful to us afterward? Go ahead.\u000a Pesticides?\u000a Pesticides, okay. Brandon?\u000a Fertilizer?\u000a  Fertilizers. Elvis?\u000a A car? What is it again?\u000a A car.\u000a  A car, okay. All right, well we'll come back to those in just a minute. So, looking at... we've kind of come up with a list here of how you would determine if things are safe or not. So, then I guess my question would become, if you look at it's color and you look at if it's in a source that looks safe or not, how would you be able to determine if something is safe to drink? So, maybe that might change your perspective a little bit. So, is there a difference between being able to drink something, and maybe being able to swim in something? In fact, let me give you just a minute to talk about that with your partner for a minute. so, my question to you again, is it... are there different things we should look for in water that we drink, versus maybe water that we swim in or take a shower in? And I want you to talk about that with your partner and jot down a couple notes about that, so go ahead.\u000a \u000a\u000a  That's interesting to hear you saying shower water isn't as filtered as your drinking water.\u000a Our pool is safe, they put a water cover over our pool so it was different. At our pool they changed from... too much chlorine can burn people's eyes, so they changed it. Yeah, definitely a bigger job, but they put a small amount of chlorine in it, so all the bacteria that's on us, if you go swim in the pool it wouldn't matter, as opposed to in the shower because it's different.\u000a Even if you do have a water cover, still it could seep through, and that's how they clean it.\u000a When they open the pool it takes like a month, because they have to go through the water thing, and all the filters.\u000a  Okay, we'll come back together as a group one more time. Thank you all, again I hear great discussions going on. So, let's talk about this. There's some very neat ideas of whether you think something is safe to drink versus whether or not it's okay to shower or to swim in. So, what were some comments you were talking about in your smaller groups? Again, I heard some great discussions going on. Mikenna, what did your group talk about?\u000a Shower water isn't as filtered as drinking water.\u000a  Okay, so in their group they believe that shower water was not as filtered as what the water is that you drink in, so if it's not as filtered, where would your drinking water be coming from that maybe your shower water isn't coming from? Okay, is there a reason that maybe you thought along sometime where the shower water is not as filtered as your drinking water?\u000a No.\u000a  No, okay. It just makes sense to you that maybe the stuff that comes out of the tap to drink, is not necessarily the same thing coming out of your pipes for the shower? Okay, what were some other comments about that? Larry, what did you guys talk about?\u000a \u000a \u000a  May I have your attention please?\u000a Would all Spelling Bee winners please report to the auditorium at this time for the Spelling Bee. Again, all Spelling Bee winners please report to the auditorium at this time for the Spelling Bee. Thank you.\u000a  Okay, so Larry, to expand upon that, and I think he brought up a really good point. He said that maybe the water that you... were you saying, Larry, swimming or showering?\u000a  He was saying that the water we drink...\u000a Hold on just one second, Isaiah, just one second.\u000a \u000a Okay good, I wanted to make sure I wasn't saying it incorrectly. So, what he was saying is, in other words, when you shower or when you are going swimming, that water is not necessarily going in your body, you're not consuming that water, so there would be a difference possibly, between the water you're swimming in versus the water that you're drinking. Walker?\u000a I said that you would swim in darker water than you drink or shower in.\u000a Okay, so sometimes you think that the water you've been in when you swim is darker. So, going back to the color difference that talked about here. Okay, interesting. Lexi?\u000a The shower water and the water that we drink I think is sort of the same, but they go through a different process, but if we go swimming at our community pool, it's different because there's more chlorine and stuff, so you have bacteria on you and you're just swimming, you not really intaking it. But at your house when you drink or take a shower, it's different.\u000a  Okay. Would you say that... Because I think it's probably safe to say you guys mostly agree that there is a difference between drinking water and water you would shower in versus water that maybe you would go swimming in. So, what are some of those differences? What might be... what might they have to do to that water? Lexi was talking about maybe it would have to be treated differently, or that there would be chemicals added to it. So, can you think of what they would do to the water in a swimming pool, versus water that you drink to make it different? I think Jack mentioned about filtering, and Mikenna also brought up the point about it being filtered different. Brandon?\u000a Well, they put more chemicals in the swimming pool, because there's gonna be more germs and when people swim in it, so that will kill off the germs. As in drinking water is not as much chemicals because there's not really any germs, you're just drinking it, so...\u000a Okay, good. So, what I'm hearing is the amount of something..., so would you all agree, as a class, if we were to drink swimming water, would you die?\u000a  No.\u000a No, probably not, right? But the amount of the chemical that is in the water might be something that would cause some effects or cause some harm to you. So, do you think that there is chlorine in your drinking water? Because we said it's in the swimming pool probably to help kill off bacteria. Do you think that... and I'm hearing a little bit of a disagreeance here, so I'd love to hear your conversation in just a minute. Elvis, what do you think?\u000a There is chlorine in the drinking water, but then they purify it, so...\u000a  So they purify out the chlorine after they put the chlorine into the drinking water?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, good. And Isaiah, what were you thinking about? I think you were saying no, that there isn't the chlorine.\u000a My question is, if there was chlorine in drinking water, I mean, you can purify it, but it may still stay around that water, then why would you drink it? I mean, sure, it can knock out the bacteria and germs, but why drink it if it has chlorine in it? Because that's not good for you.\u000a  Okay, and going back to the amounts of it, and you're thinking that even the smallest amount might not be healthy for you to put in your system. Okay, Jack?\u000a Well, for a normal tap system, I think it's the last, or second last step they do, is they insert really small amount of chlorine into all tap water, usually in a normal town. And, so then a lot of people have chlorine in their drinking water, but for some people who have specialized filters for drinking water, they're designed to filter out all of the chlorine so that it's mostly just water that they're getting. So, some people have a filter installed.\u000a Okay, and would you be able to tell based on the color, because that seems to be what a lot of people are using as their indicator of good water. Would you be able to tell just by the color whether or not there's a lot of chlorine in it?\u000a  Maybe, maybe not. I don't know if this contributes to it, but sometimes I look at my drinking water compared to the tap water, and the tap water is a lot more foggy, so I don't know if that's because the chlorine or because it's aerated or something, but I don't know.\u000a  Okay good, thank you for sharing that. Elvis.\u000a You can buy those little filters that you can screw onto your taps so that way it filters down the water. I have one and it filters out tap water.\u000a  Okay, and it's filtering out more of the amount, or maybe none of it at all. Okay. Let's go back... oh, go ahead Madeline.\u000a I would just like to say to Isaiah's comment, we sort of have to have chlorine in our water because there would be more bacteria if we didn't, so there's a reason for it, and it's not that much. So, it would do you less harm to have the chlorine in the water than to not have it.\u000a  Okay, so the benefits of what you're saying is that you would at least have to have a little bit to kill off the bacteria, and that would outweigh the fact of you not having anything at all, and then being exposed to maybe whatever is in the water that the chlorine is not killing off, right? Okay, very good. Let's look at... We've used, again, some criteria, and let's look at that final question of, what is your definition of water quality? So, in other words, I think Jordan, I heard in your discussion, could you read your answer for us one more time about what you think water quality is to you?\u000a Water quality is how good the water is for you to drink.\u000a  Good, how good the water is for you to drink. Can I hear another definition of water quality? Kris, what did you decide?\u000a  How clean the water was?\u000a  How clean the water was, okay. And how would you determine if the water is clean or not? What was your number one indicator?\u000a  When you drink it.\u000a  When you drink it, okay. So, if you drink it and you know that it's clean, then it has good water quality to it. All right. Isaiah?\u000a My definition of water quality is how much of the water is polluted, and how much of the water is pure.\u000a  So, polluted versus pure and then kind of a ratio of if it's polluted and more pure then it's better water quality. Okay. Rachel, how about your definition of water quality?\u000a We said that water quality was how much of the water is pure water, and how much of it's polluted.\u000a  Okay, so going back to that same definition together as you all talked. And Ashani, what did you think water quality would be?\u000a How good the water is because some water, it like tastes different, you can tell.\u000a  Okay, so the taste. Have you ever experienced where water might taste a little different, can you think of an example?\u000a My aunt's house, when we go to her house it's always different from our house.\u000a  And what kind of taste would you say?\u000a It's gross.\u000a  It's gross water. Maybe back to when we were talking about well water in here versus the regular city water, and it has a different taste to it. So, what we're gonna do, is using your ideas so far, you guys have told me again based on color, and you mentioned about the smell of it, and you've mentioned about tasting the water. So, I have here three different liquids that I'm going to go around and show you, and on your paper, you're going to determine if these liquids are safe or if these liquids are not. And since we have already discussed that there's probably different qualities for your water versus the water you drink versus the water that you swim in or the water that you are going to take a shower in, so when you comment upon whether those liquids are safe or not, I think it would probably be a wise decision to comment if you think they're safe to drink versus safe to shower or to swim. So, I'll start here with cup letter A. So, you can go ahead and mark "A" on your paper, and then I will walk around so you can just take an observation of the liquid. And you determine, again, if you think that it is safe.\u000a  All right, so what do you all think? Logan? Do you think that this is safe to drink? So, if I gave this to you right now, you'd go ahead and drink it because it would be safe?\u000a  No.\u000a  No? What would make you change your answer then?\u000a

V  Okay let's get busy. \u000a  So before we change the car we have two more times. \u000a  Okay let's look Jacob, let's help.\u000a  It's 9-3.\u000a  What is 9, three?\u000a  93.\u000a  93. Is there a way, that we can maybe change to other things here, to make it go further? Like the car?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  How? Maybe the height? How about you guys discuss. \u000a  Oh, try it. Put that way back like that. It might need help, for you holding the ramp, how bout you, do you think that's a good idea?\u000a  I'm gonna roll it back.\u000a  Alright.\u000a  Oh. \u000a  Is it gonna stay you think?\u000a  Yeah, I bet.\u000a  Awesome. Let's see how far it went. \u000a  Watch your foot.\u000a  105.\u000a  What is 105?\u000a  105.\u000a  I love the way that you're making sure that that goes nice and smooth on the way in. So let's take a look Jacob, let's look over here. Let's look at our data, we have the roll one, with just the normal way, we had 101 inches. And then the roll two which was again the same way at 93 inches. And roll three at 105 inches. Which way went the furthest?\u000a  103, roll three.\u000a  Roll three. Why do you think that is?\u000a  Because it's 101, that one is 101, and that ones 105.\u000a  Well why do you think roll one is different from roll three?\u000a  Because ones higher then the other.\u000a  ...higher then the other.\u000a  Because ones higher then the other. Okay, so do you want to try to add in or take away something from this vehicle?\u000a  I think we should--\u000a  What do you think we should pick? \u000a  Take away the girl.\u000a  Take away the girl?\u000a  Nothing. \u000a  What do you guys think about Hailey's idea? What did she say?\u000a  Jacob S.\u000a  Hold on, what did Hailey say? Say it again. \u000a  We shouldn't even try?\u000a  Okay, \u000a  Okay so how about Jacob, since Jacob was trying to make the other car, how 'bout Jacob tries to put on bigger wheels? We should see what happens then. \u000a  Here Jacob. Well look at this, look at which one would we need bigger wheels on?\u000a  That one\u000a  That one.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  So  that car. Go farther, that one will go farther.\u000a  Probably will go farther you think, with bigger wheels?\u000a \u000a  Yeah.\u000a  'Cause the bigger the wheel, the easier it has balance.\u000a   Did you hear what he said?\u000a  Bigger wheels have balance.\u000a  The bigger the wheels the more balanced it is.\u000a  I'm saying like, let's say you're \u000a  Is that gonna work? Is there anything else you guys want to do to this car? Or do you just want to change one thing?\u000a  I just change one thing.\u000a  Okay, it's your car. So what about your ramp? Ashley, what about your ramp, how do you want your ramp to be?\u000a  Maybe we can take this off and do it in the normal way.\u000a  Okay.\u000a   76.\u000a  You want to try that way? Alright. \u000a  That's true.\u000a  Whoa.\u000a  That wasn't go far.\u000a  Alright, let's measure.\u000a  It goes a little bit. She needs a little bit of help. \u000a  72.\u000a  72.\u000a  We're gonna put this vehicle--\u000a  Alright, so we're not going to change the car, but what could we do?\u000a  32.\u000a  Whoa look.\u000a {Student] Guys this is going to be affecting weight okay?\u000a  That box could stay here instead of-- \u000a  Alright, you guys try it. You guys got it now?\u000a  91 times 2. \u000a  Well that's up to your group.\u000a  Can I make my car now?\u000a  No, not yet. That's not weight three yet.\u000a  Split weight right now so--\u000a  How you guys doing? \u000a  Did you guys try to move the weight in different ways?\u000a  Ok.\u000a  Alright, back.\u000a  Let's do it together  \u000a  56.\u000a   Look at that, let's see what happened.\u000a  No it's 67.\u000a  Where's your data at? Put the data over here so we're all in the same place.\u000a  83.\u000a  Okay let's take a look. What do you have here?\u000a  67. \u000a  This will be so much fun.\u000a  Okay, you roll it.\u000a  Ashley, can I work on it, can I have it?\u000a  Should we take something away first?\u000a  No.\u000a  No.\u000a  42!\u000a  I think we should put a little one. Gimme that.\u000a  You think we should--  \u000a  I'm not sure.\u000a Cause the blue one \u000a  Wow.\u000a  Cool!\u000a  Oh. Oh my gosh.\u000a  Here I'll--\u000a  \u000a  Yeah.\u000a  And without these wheels. Now? Are you ready?\u000a  Go!\u000a  Here, here we go. Ouchie.  hold the end.\u000a  I'll hold it.\u000a  77?\u000a  No, it's 67.\u000a  Jacob \u000a  67.\u000a  Might be 77.\u000a  What is 77?\u000a   We did it for two ways so they can do it last way.\u000a  That was way more.\u000a  Yeah but \u000a  How many inches was that second roll?\u000a  Look--\u000a  Three feet so 3 F.\u000a  So what, three feet equals\u000a  36 inches.\u000a  We're going to be focused on the inches so we don't get confused.\u000a  \u000a  So hold on, wait a second. When we had that ramp the first way, what did you do with it, the same way as the first way?\u000a  No we did... this way.\u000a  Just that?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  We haven't done it like that.\u000a  I know just re-adjust this.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So when did it go, when you did just that? \u000a  30 seconds, no it went that.\u000a  What is that?\u000a  73.\u000a  73. So then we moved it, to make it, which way did we do it the second way?\u000a  Higher.\u000a  We did it this way, what happened to the numbers?\u000a  It went lower.\u000a  It went lower?\u000a  So if we go it lower, it goes higher.\u000a  I don't know, let's try. So what's another ramp that we can make? Have you tried that way before?\u000a  Nope.\u000a  Alright, let's see. Hold on a second David, we have to measure.\u000a  \u000a  Nope, your group can help you measure. Let's see.\u000a  35. Ooh, that's seven.\u000a  Okay, let's take a look again, let's make sure. What's that?\u000a  \u000a  There we go. So roll three, let's try. Now let's take a look at our data, hold on.\u000a  That's not gonna work.\u000a  You don't think so? Well let's first take a look here and then we can see if that will work.\u000a  It's probably gonna fall.\u000a  What happened with roll three, where's the data? Look at roll three, what is it?\u000a  35.\u000a  And what's roll two?\u000a  I don't know.\u000a  36. So what do you think happened, whenever we made the ramp a little bit higher? I mean a little bit lower I'm sorry.\u000a  It changed?\u000a  It changed. What happened when it changed?\u000a  The number.\u000a  I see, let's focus.\u000a  It goes more...faster.\u000a  It might go more faster. There's not another roll four but you made a very interesting ramp, and you guys wanna try that?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay let's see, let's see what happens Taylor.  What happened?\u000a  \u000a  It fell.\u000a  I knew it would.\u000a  --my box.\u000a  Well how about you hold that, so we can try it again. Try it again. Oh no! Fix em and let's see if it does that every time, do you think it'll do it every time?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Yes.\u000a   Let's try again.\u000a  I'll measure this time.\u000a  You'll measure?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Oh.\u000a  Oh.\u000a  We have to do it again.\u000a  Taylor, you can go on the carpet.\u000a  This time I made it lower. \u000a  Oh\u000a  So he just said something, what did he say?\u000a  He made it lower.\u000a  He made it lower.\u000a  So what's happening, every time he makes it a little bit lower?\u000a  It falls off.\u000a  When it falls off, it still can roll. I mean just keep it rolling when it falls off.\u000a  Uh oh .\u000a  I'll measure it.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  We don't have enough space to measure that one, how about we change the car and try again. But what did you guys notice every time the ramp changed? What happened when it was super high?\u000a  It fell apart.\u000a  It didn't work so well, can you imagine if you were in a real car, and you were going down something that steep?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  No.\u000a  That would be kinda scary wouldn't it? But, as it kept going down, what happened?\u000a  It didn't go off.\u000a  It didn't fall apart, you're right. Alright go back and try to make a different car. Okay go back and try to make it, be careful your gonna make me nervous. \u000a  Alright let's see Jacob, what do you have? Come on over. Nope, Jacob come on over. What in the world did you make? That looks like a Mack Truck. Girls do you see this?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Tractors, throwing in something.\u000a  Now take a look roll it and see if that one feels good to you.\u000a  Big.\u000a  Girls are you watching? Look at how that rolled. Girls, you next.\u000a \u000a  Okay.\u000a  This was all my idea.\u000a  That was your idea? I love it.\u000a  Could we try it this way?\u000a  We could, keep a hold of that you might want to try it. Let's see.... Well we should be working on-- Correctamundo.\u000a  See? I got a good review.\u000a  What do we got Jacob?\u000a  93.\u000a  93. So what can we do to change it?\u000a  I guess we could maybe...\u000a  We're learning something.\u000a  We are learning something, what did we learning?\u000a  We learned the car, the littler it is, the harder for it to fall.\u000a  That is true?\u000a  It's your turn.\u000a  Is that what you're finding out, the smaller the car?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  The smaller the car, the more it picks up.\u000a  Picks up?\u000a  Cars go over.\u000a  Oh were we going over?\u000a  No I--\u000a  It's your turn Preston.\u000a  Oh, did you guys hear him? Let's take a second and listen. He was talking about yesterday's experiment, what did we do yesterday?\u000a  We tried rolling little cars on the carpet.\u000a  Why didn't it work out so well Jacob? Little cars on the carpet.\u000a  Because the wheels stopped them.\u000a  Why did they stop, you think?\u000a  Because the carpets too rough.\u000a  Because the carpet's too rough. Did you guys find that too? So what are you finding about today?\u000a  That the bigger the wheels, the \u000a-on hard surfaces.\u000a  It's faster on smoother and hard surfaces, it goes further So what are you finding out about the ramp?\u000a  That--\u000a  You guys are finding that? How about you decide that for this last one, you tried one way with the ramp. And now we're going to try, two more ways with this ramp, and I want to see if guys can figure out, how this works better with a ramp.\u000a

V  So just leave your clicker on your table guys. I mean you can put one in front of you, just don't turn it on yet, they're not activated. Please don't play with them because then the batteries can stay charged through the day. Thank you for the help. Excellent, thanks. All right guys, so let's get started with our discussion here. Set the clicker down please don't play with it, just leave it on the table, thank you. I asked you today to get our thinking going to answer this question. Danny DeVito is between 4'9" and 5'1" tall. So, i'm 5'10" so Danny DeVito is either between this tall or about this tall. We're not sure on his height. His wife, Rhea Perlman is 5'0 tall. How tall do you think their sons and daughters will be and why? All right, so please raise your hand to share your answer, and I'm going to ask you why you think like you do. So, I'm going to start back there with Alex. So, turn this way so that I can hear you,  okay?\u000a  Okay. I think their kids would be around 5' because their mom is 5' tall and their dad his middle height is 5'?\u000a  Okay, so you're looking at the middle estimated height of Danny DeVito and his wife's height is 5', so you think together then all their children will be 5', boys and girls?\u000a  Mm-hm.\u000a Okay. Great, thank you. What else do you think? J.R.?\u000a I said 5' too. I said 5' as well because that's about how tall they are, so their kid would be around that.\u000a  Okay, so you're looking at kind of his average height and her height, so you think the kids will be around that? Okay, anything different or you want to explain it further? Michael?\u000a  I just said that you get your height from your parents, so whatever the parents were right around 5' the kids will be about 5'.\u000a  Okay, you get your height from your parents. So, since the parents are about 5' the kids will be 5'. Boys and girls?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay, great. What do you think?\u000a  Well, I think  the daughter could be 4'9" and the sons would be around 5'2", because both of the parents are shorter, and so they could be a little bit taller or even a little bit shorter than one of their parents?\u000a Okay, so even though the parents are shorter they could be taller or shorter than the parents, and you said that the daughters could be about 4'9" and the sons might be about 5'2"?\u000a Yes.\u000a Is there a reason why you think the boys would end up being taller than the girls?\u000a It's just kind of a normal thing. Normally boys are taller than girls.\u000a Okay, so a normal thing, boys are usually taller than girls. Okay, great. Any other ideas on the height of their children? Adam, what do you think? Well, what do you think about...\u000a I think that they'll be around, I think boys and girls, will both be around 5' because it's right inbetween the parents.\u000a  Okay, good. What about me and my family? I'm 5'10". So, I'm tall. What do you think about my family members? How tall do you think they are? I'm 5'10", how tall do you think my mom is? How tall do you think my dad is? What's your estimation? What do you think? Raise your hands everybody, let's participate. Mackenzie what do you think?\u000a I think your dad would be around 6'2" and I think your mom would be around 5'11" or 5'9"?\u000a  Okay, so my mom is between 5'9" and 5'11", so close to my height, and my dad would be taller, about 6'2". Brian, what do you think?\u000a  I said that I think your dad would be taller than you, but then your mom would be around the same height.\u000a  So, my mom is about the same height and my dad is taller?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Anybody think anything. . .  Pardon me?\u000a  Or like around 6'.\u000a  My dad would be around 6'?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  What if I tell you my little brother...  my little baby brother, is 6'4"? And he is. This is true, he is 6'4". So, he's a tall guy. Does that change your ideas about the heights of my parents? You guys are nodding "yes." What do you think now? Travis?\u000a  Maybe your dad is like 6'4" and your mom is like 5'8" or 5'9" or something?\u000a  Okay, so Mom is about here, Dad is taller or 6'4" like my little brother? Michael, what do you think?\u000a Both of them are about 6'.\u000a Both of them are about 6'. Okay, great, what do you think?\u000a Well, I know that a lot of people get their traits from their dad, from dads. So, that your dad is taller around 6'5" and then your mom is shorter, like 5'8".\u000a So, you see my height, and my mom is about 5'8" and my dad is 6'5",  so for my brother and I, you're figuring about our traits? What do you mean?\u000a That you get your traits from your dad.\u000a So, my dad's genes are coming through. Why do you think that? Why do you think I have only traits from my dad.\u000a Because I know a lot of people who get their traits from their dad and more than their mom.\u000a So, more traits from dad than from mom? Do you think that's pretty much general?\u000a  Yeah. Okay, great. Do you guys have anything to comment on that? What do you think?\u000a I think your dad's probably like 6'2", because my brothers are both taller than my dad already and they're still in high school?\u000a  Oh, interesting. Well, I'll tell you my mom was 5'11" at her tallest. Now she's shrinking, she's like 5'9". You know how that happens as you get older and my dad, he's only 6' tall. So, my little brother is the tallest in the family and my other brother, he's 6'1". So, height does come from both sides, but my dad's not as tall you guy's might've thought. Let's talk about Danny DeVito again. Here he is, our favorite actor, right? Notice his lack of hair, he's bald. The question on here says "Danny DeVito is bald. What do you think his son's hair or lack of will look like when he's older, and why?" His son, Danny DeVitto has a son. What do you think about his hair? Nice and loud so I can hear you. Matthew.\u000a It said that their son would have bald hair on the top, but some on the sides?\u000a  Some will be bald on the top, but he'll have some hair around the sides. Why do you think that?\u000a Because usually if somebody's dad's bald they're not always bald.\u000a  If somebody's dad is bald they are not always bald?\u000a  I've seen that.\u000a You've seen that? That's a good observation, Matt. What do you think?\u000a  Well, the mom has a lot of hair and the dad is bald, so I thought,  he will still have a lot more hair than his dad. He wouldn't be completely bald, but bald on top.\u000a Okay, so mom has a lot of hair, dad's bald. So, you think the son will have hair, but just bald on top?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So, when you see the traits being passed down, how do you see it?\u000a I'm not really sure what you mean by that question.\u000a You're kind of saying that he'll have this trait, but he'll also have this trait. So, how do you see that happening? Did he get all of his traits from one or all his traits from another, the son, or do you think . . .\u000a I think they were combined.\u000a They were combined. The traits are combined. Good, Sean?\u000a I thought he would have like a blackish-brown hair, because that's what the mom's hair color is.\u000a  Okay?\u000a He probably wouldn't be bald, but he'd have a receding hairline.\u000a  Okay, so he would have a receding hairline, and for those of us that don't know what that means, that means when a person starts to lose their hair, and it kind of inches back and they're losing their hair. That's what a receding hairline is. So, the hair falls out as it moves back. Are you ready to see what Danny Devito's kids look like? Here they are for our predictions. We have his son in the middle standing taller than everyone else in the family. He's about 5'5". So, he's taller than both mom and dad. This is Danny Devito's wife, Danny Devito and his son. Here's his daughters. This daughter is about the height of the mom, but she has big shoes on. The other daughter is taller. But notice their hair, what do you notice about their hair? Ryan, tell me what you notice about all three kids.\u000a Well, they all have hair, they're not bald.\u000a  They all have hair, they're not bald. How would you describe their hair?\u000a Curly?\u000a  Curly hair. What color?\u000a Black.\u000a  Black or dark brown, yes very good. All right, so we see that. Now, when we think about these bunnies, another question I asked you is this, look at the picture. If they had ten offspring, what do you think the coats for each bunny would look like? The fur in what respect, that was the question. Nathan, what do you think?\u000a  25% would be white, 25% would be black, the remainder would be gray with a little white? So, part of them will be black and part of them will be white... So, half of them will be gray... ?\u000a  Okay, so here's what we have. I'm going to use abbreviations. and 50% will be gray. Nathan says that because one parent is white, one's black they'll combine to form a gray color, just like mixing paint in art class. Any other predictions? What else are you thinking? Let's hear from somebody new. What else do you think? Omar.\u000a  I think 40% of the bunnies are going to be black, are going to be half black and half white, like a black bunny with white dots, or a white bunny with black dots.\u000a  All right. So, you're saying 40% black, 40% white, You will see both colors. We'll see black and we'll see white. Why did you choose 40%, 40% and 20%?\u000a  Because I think that it's rare for bunnies to have dots . . . It might be rare for them to have dots.\u000a  Okay, so you see that a solid colored bunny more likely, the probability is higher for a solid color. So, that's why you chose 20%? Great, great thinking. Great explanation. Sean, what do you think?\u000a I had 20% white, and the rest are gray. I would have said 25%, but you can't have two and a half babies being white.\u000a Okay. All right, so you would've said 25%. So, you were thinking similarly.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Why do you say 20%, 20% and 60%?\u000a Because most of them would be a mixture of the two, but a few of them would have to have more of one of the parent rabbit's traits.\u000a  Okay, so because they have offspring, the majority will be a mixture of both of their traits? So, mom and dad will blend together to create gray, but some of them will look just like the father, some will look just like the mother, so some will be black, some will be white. Great. One more idea.  Kasey what do you think?\u000a  I know in health  that everyone has a dominant feature. I think white is, so that the majority, so like 40% would be white, and 20% would be black, and then the rest would be gray.\u000a 40% white, 20% black and 20% gray. And you said, because in health you were learning about dominant features and you believe...\u000a  That's only 80%. Oh, what did you say for the last one?\u000a I said the rest.\u000a Wow, well thanks for paying attention Good check there guys.\u000a  It would be 40%.\u000a ...60%, we need 40... Did you say 40?\u000a  I said the rest.\u000a I was just making up too many different numbers. Well, I'm so happy that you guys are paying attention. I'm going to tell your math teacher, good job. Okay, 40% white, but here's what Kasey said that was really good.  She said that 40% will be white, because white is dominant. You used that word. You talked about that in health a little bit. So, let's talk about dominant and what that means. What does it mean? What do you think dominant means? And be nice and loud for us. John.\u000a Most of?\u000a  Most of. Good. What do you think Sam?\u000a Main?\u000a  Main... Sean?\u000a The majority?\u000a  The majority...Alex?\u000a Beat out all others?\u000a  Beat out all others. Nice.  What do you think, Sean?\u000a  Strongest?\u000a  Okay. Let me show you a little example here. So, where do we get our traits, first of all? Where do we get traits?\u000a  From parents.\u000a From where?\u000a  Parents.\u000a Your parents. Okay, it's passed down. Traits are passed down and some come from each parent, right? Dominant, recessive, some come from both mom and dad. If you received a dominant trait . . . See I labeled this cup dominant and colored it pink and you received a recessive trait. So, half and half, mom and dad. They come together, which trait do you see? The dominant one or the recessive one?\u000a  The dominant one.\u000a The dominant one. What if I put it this way. Which trait do you see? The dominant one. What if I put two recessive traits together?\u000a  The recessive.\u000a The recessive, okay. Either way I pair them, mom or dad, dad or mom. If I have two dominant traits that go together, what do I see?\u000a  Dominant.\u000a Dominant, okay. So, if the dominant trait is present, then... finish the sentence. If the dominant trait is present in your genes, then what?\u000a  It will show.\u000a It will show, Kasey says. That's right, if the dominant trait is present it will show. Are you guys remembering this from yesterdays little intro? Okay, let's check this then real quick. Yesterday you filled out this concept map. Let's make sure that your answers are correct. Jsut take a look. So, read this with me.\u000a  "Genetics is the study of heredity, the passing of traits from parent to offspring" and if the offspring has the same alleles, we call that?\u000a  Purebred.\u000a And if they have different alleles?\u000a  Hybrid.\u000a What that means, allele, that word say that, allele.\u000a  Allele.\u000a It's the fun word to say during our genetics unit. That's the form of the gene, so is it a dominant or is it a recessive. Okay, so let's go back here. Genetics is the study of . . .\u000a  Heredity.\u000a The passing of...\u000a  Traits.\u000a I don't hear everybody. Controlled by...\u000a  Genes.\u000a Made of...\u000a  Alleles.\u000a Say it again. Alleles.\u000a  Alleles.\u000a So genes made of...\u000a  Alleles.\u000a Shows when present. We call that...\u000a  Dominant.\u000a And can be masked...\u000a  Recessive.\u000a Recessive, all right, very good. Any questions on the concept map? Any corrections if you need to make them, please do so. All right! Well, let's get going with our lab. Are you guys ready? Okay, please take out your lab paper? We're going to go back to some of those reflection questions later on. Notice the top of the paper. It says "Problem". This is what we're trying to solve. This is the point of our scientific investigation. "Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles." I'd like you, on the lines, to create your own hypothesis, or your prediction for this. "Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common" that's the question "are they more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles?" So, write down what you think, write down your prediction. If you can write it in the if-then format of how we do hypotheses, that's preferred, but if that confuses you at this point, just write what you think is going to happen. Are dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles. Whatever you think, it's your thinking. We will talk about our hypotheses in just a moment. So, once you've written down your hypothesis, reread it and make sure that it answers the question. Then we're going to get to work using our clickers, which i'll explain in just a moment. I'd like to hear you share some hypotheses before we begin. The question again, "Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles?" Please share your prediction, your hypothesis. Ronnie.\u000a I said yes, because dominant alleles, it shows over recessive alleles?\u000a So, you believe dominant will be more common because they show over recessive alleles. Okay, great. Girls, one of you share your hypothesis for me. Who would like to share? Everyones looking at you Kate. What do you have on your paper?\u000a  I said that I thought the dominant alleles were more common?\u000a You believe the dominant alleles will be more common. Okay, great, thank you.  Another one. Alex?\u000a  I agreed with it. I said that I believe that dominant traits were more common than recessive, because there's more combinations to get dominant one's over recessive.\u000a You believe dominant traits are more common than the recessive, because there's more combinations...\u000a  To get that?\u000a To get to that. To get the dominant traits to show. Good. One more. Matthew?\u000a I said that the dominant traits are less common, because in the picture with Danny DeVito? His son and daughters didn't look much like him?\u000a Okay, so you believe that the dominant traits are less common, because in the example of Danny DeVito, his kids didn't look much like him.\u000a  Yeah, and how your younger brother is 6'4"...\u000a And how my younger brother is 6'4", but he's taller than the rest of my family. Okay, so you're making connections to our earlier conversation, good. We're going to revisit our hypotheses after we do this lab.\u000a

V And one more.\u000a There's this one spider and he's around all day and then he comes and comes out.\u000a  Oh, so it's waiting for him. You know, i'ts like a trap.\u000a It covers itself in the flower and like it sets in the flower. It sits perfectly still in the flower and then when something lands on it, it attacks it and eats it.\u000a Wonderful, so they're not really attracted to flowers, they're attracted to the insects in order to ambush them. Is that what you're telling me?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Okay, all right. So, and we talked about what is it that attracts these? Well, we see a lot of bugs, we see humming birds, and Jack mentioned this word, pollen. Do you know what pollen is? Do you know what pollen is?\u000a  Ah...\u000a  Do you know what pollen is? Are these things attracted to the pollen?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Well, not really though.\u000a  No, not really?\u000a  Sometimes.\u000a  Sometimes.\u000a  I guess.\u000a  Say that again please?\u000a  It's an ingredient to make honey.\u000a Pollen is an ingredient to make honey?\u000a  Oh, nectar? Yeah.\u000a So bees are attracted to flowers because of their... blank.\u000a  Nectar. Go ahead, Jimmy.  How would you fill this in? The bees are attracted to flowers because of their... blank. Go ahead and write your answer in.\u000a  Oh, okay.\u000a I see some people writing pollen. You have color. They're definitely attracted to their color. We have nectar. And we have, we actually have all of them here. So, which one is it? Is it one of these or all of these?\u000a  All of these.\u000a  All of them.\u000a All of them, tell me more. Tell me.\u000a  I think it's pollen  and nectar because the nectar's in the pollen and the bees take the pollen and then use the pollen to make stuff, or honey out of it. So, it's kind of like taking it to its'...\u000a So, we say that flowers attract insects, so we can connect these two ideas here. And we've talked about their color. The insects were attracted because of their color and they're also attracted because of their...\u000a  Nectar.\u000a Nectar, okay, let's put nectar right here. And they're also attracted because of their good smell?\u000a  No.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  No?\u000a  The nectar smells good, that's why butterflies go to them.\u000a  Maybe look that up on Google. Why do you think flowers take all the trouble to make them smell good?\u000a  So bees will go to them.\u000a Why do people go to trouble to smell good?\u000a  \u000a Why not?\u000a  Because, it would be gross.\u000a Say that again.\u000a Attention?\u000a You want attention? You want to be attractive to other people too?\u000a  Heck no.\u000a Maybe you're too young for that. Yeah, when you get older, don't you want to attract other people?\u000a  Sure.\u000a Don't you want other people to find you pleasant?\u000a  Yes.\u000a You know, it's not a big thing, but are these fragrances signals to these insects? They're attractive right? And we'll talk about, I agree, they are useful, but that's not going to fit into my process just yet. But all of these things do attract the insects, right? But what is it that keeps the insects coming back? It's sort of like the color, the smell, you know, the, maybe the shape of the flower. All of these things are like advertisements to the insects. Why?\u000a  For the nectar?\u000a For the nectar. It's the nectar that's going to keep them coming back. All right, you see this bee here? What's all this yellow stuff on the bee?\u000a  Pollen?\u000a Pollen. Does the pollen attract the bee?\u000a  No.\u000a Does the bee want the pollen?\u000a  No.\u000a  Yes and no because the pollen helps all of the flowers to stay alive.\u000a  The pollen is definitely important to the flower, right?\u000a  Mm-hm? The bees just spread it around.\u000a  The bees spread it around? How many people are aware that bees spread pollen? I see just about all your hands go up. So the insects are spreading, let's put that up here, they're going to spread the stuff called pollen. Right? Of course, the insects are really getting what?\u000a  Nectar.\u000a Yeah, so let's put they are taking or they obtain this nectar here, right? And nectar is another word for what?\u000a  Food.\u000a You all understand that nectar is their food?\u000a  For the bees.\u000a  For the bees? Just the bees?\u000a  No, and hummingbirds.\u000a And insects?\u000a  Us.\u000a And hummingbirds?\u000a  Us, us, we have honey. Nectar is technically honey.\u000a So, nectar is actually a food for us, because we steal it from the bees, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a And we hide it from the bears, yes?\u000a  Isn't there this one point where it has saliva, or something in the bottom of it, and it's in the shape of a picture, and all of these flies and everything are attracted from the sweet smell and everything, and they get into the water, they can't move and everything, they're paralyzed?\u000a Okay, it's a trap.\u000a  Yeah. \u000a  Like the venus fly trap.\u000a Just like the venus fly trap.\u000a  Yeah, I don't know what it's called.\u000a Do venus fly traps have flowers?\u000a  No, they have clear white.\u000a  The mouth smells really sweet.\u000a  That's because it catches flies.\u000a Okay, we're going to talk about that in a minute. A lot of people, when I was reading your paragraphs, a lot of people told me that venus fly traps were one of the many kinds of plants that don't have flowers. All right, but let's look at this thing about pollen for a minute. Why is it that the flowers want these insects to keep stealing their nectar? What's going on here? They want them to spread the pollen, but why?\u000a  To make more food?\u000a  To make what?\u000a  To make more food?\u000a  You think it's to make more food. What do you think Olivia?\u000a  To make like honey.\u000a  The flowers want the bees to make honey?\u000a  No, they like  need it to make more food.\u000a  Pollen is an ingredient for nectar to make.\u000a I understand that, but why does the flower go to all this trouble? Do flowers just like bees?\u000a  No.\u000a They say hey, you're a nice guy. We'll make you some...\u000a  To keep them alive, I think?\u000a To keep... the flowers are making the food to keep the bees alive?\u000a  No.\u000a   I don't know.\u000a  That's okay, that's okay. What do you think, Joe?\u000a  To fertilize other flowers?\u000a Fertilize? What's fertilize? You mean to like give them like fertilizer on the ground? Or are you talking about a different kind of fertilizer?\u000a Different.\u000a You're calling it a different kind of fertilizer. Interesting. How many people understand that flowers are related to fertilization? How many people have heard that before? Hands up here, okay. So, if you want to ask what pollen is, you might want to ask what flowers do. All right and to answer that, I first of all, let's make sure, this dandelion, is this a flower or is this a weed?\u000a  Flower.\u000a  A weed.\u000a Okay, thumbs up or thumbs down. Who says it's a weed? Okay? I see most of you thumbs up, a couple of you have sideways or down. Next, how about this one, how many people think it's a flower? Okay. How many people say it's a weed and a flower? Now I see some people who don't know. Well, let me ask you this. If you're to look at this, here's a pretty good picture of it, what makes you think it's a flower? Are there characteristics about this plant that make you think it's a flower?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  I don't think it's a flower...\u000a That's not my question. Are there characteristics about this that make you think it's a flower?\u000a  Yes.\u000a What would those be?\u000a The petals?\u000a The petals? Excellent. Anything else?\u000a  It's color?\u000a It's colorful? Anything else?\u000a  It has some nectar, maybe?\u000a You think it has nectar?\u000a  Maybe a little bit.\u000a Have you ever seen insects hovering around dandelions?\u000a Yes.\u000a Who have seen... who have seen? Yeah, it's very common. Well, you can actually see bees on top of, on top of flowers. Here's a close up of the dandelion. What do you notice there?\u000a  That looks a lot more ugly?\u000a It looks ugly?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Really?\u000a  No it looks cool.\u000a  It looks like water spouts goin' like...\u000a It does look like water. What do you see on the side here?\u000a  Pollen.\u000a Does that look like pollen? What does pollen look like?\u000a  Just tiny balls of... stuff.\u000a Of stuff, yeah?\u000a There those tiny little, like, they look like little leftover pieces just hanging off the side of the stem and it's with the bees and it sticks to the bees when they land on the flower, so it stays with them for a while. A ball and then it sticks to the bee, like if you want to see the bee, it's got all the yellow stuff on his leg?\u000a  Yeah, we had the picture earlier, yeah.\u000a  Yeah, I saw a bee on a flower in the summer and he had a bunch of that yellow stuff on his body?\u000a  Cool.\u000a  Actually, that's the pollen.\u000a So the pollen, so it is picking up pollen. So, it sounds to me that, I guess what I want to convince you is that dandelions are flowers.\u000a  They are?\u000a Yeah, they're definitely flowers. Let me show you a picture of a dandelion. A little video, it's about one minute long, and let's go ahead and turn the lights off. And as you're watching it, just tell me what you observe happening in the video. Just go ahead and shout it out.\u000a  The flower is opening, it's blossoming.\u000a Okay, this is time lapse, so this is happening a lot faster than what it really normally, but you saw the flower open?\u000a  It's dormant, dying now.\u000a  And now it's closing up and it's dying.\u000a  It's going dormant.\u000a  It's dead. How many people think it's dead?\u000a  No, it's still growing.\u000a  It's dormant.\u000a  It's growing into that white stuff.\u000a  Say that again?\u000a  It's turning into that thing in the ball.\u000a  That's like, Marissa's making a prediction.\u000a  It's gonna grow taller.\u000a  No, it's going to break up.\u000a  Do you see the insects all over it? Every now and then you can kind of see an insect on it.\u000a  Oh, yeah.\u000a  Yeah, there's one down at the root.\u000a  At the very base of it.\u000a  Yeah, something's happening.\u000a  Something's happening.\u000a  It got taller on the screen.\u000a  Oh, the bottom petals are starting to die.\u000a  \u000a  What's that?\u000a  It's starting to look like an onion.\u000a  What's that thing on the top?\u000a  It's going to blow away.\u000a  It's going to grow into a dandelion.\u000a  That was the flower, wasn't it?\u000a  That's the thing you blow on.\u000a  What's that?\u000a  They're seeds, they're seeds!\u000a  Yeah, you blow on them and it's really fun.\u000a  It's reproducing.\u000a  I'm hearing Steven say they're seeds. And Brandon, oh that thing disappeared. That whole top blew away.\u000a  That's the stuff that you like to blow.\u000a  How many people think these are seeds?\u000a  I know they are.\u000a  Ah, Andrew's thinking. So the flower turned into what?\u000a  A seed.\u000a  A reproducer.\u000a  A big seed?\u000a  No, they're all little seeds.\u000a  No, they're all individual seeds.\u000a  Are they blowing?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Make a wish. Can I have the lights on please. So you have... \u000a  Like a month period.\u000a  Yeah, that took a while. And I think you've seen dandelions, you may not have, you've probably seen the dandelions in two stages. Sometimes they're like gel flowers and later they turn into these little white, puffy, seed pods, right?\u000a  You puff on them and they blow in the wind.\u000a  Yeah, what does the wind do?\u000a  It blows them away and it starts reproducing.\u000a So each seed is like a little parachute?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a And it's dispersed to new lands?\u000a  Yes.\u000a All right, so if I were to say flowers, if I were to make a connection between flowers and seeds, what would you say about that? What will you say? What is the connection between flowers and seeds? McKenzie?\u000a  They both reproduce.\u000a  They're both  related to reproduction. Okay, uh-huh?\u000a  One makes another?\u000a Okay, so one flowers make seeds or flowers produce seeds, and there's that word that McKenzie was using, reproduce because seeds grow into...\u000a  Flowers?\u000a Flowers which then...\u000a  Grow into seeds?\u000a  Which then...\u000a  Grow into more plants?\u000a  What does that sound like?\u000a  Life cycles!\u000a Wonderful, wonderful, these are life cycles. What I'm going to ask you to do right now, is we're going to look at a seed very, very closely. I have some, you know what these are? Lima beans?\u000a  Oh, I love lima beans.\u000a You do, really?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Oh, I don't like lima beans.\u000a  I've never tried them.\u000a  I like them in my favorite dish, chicken pot pie.\u000a My dad loves lima beans, anyway. I have some. They have been soaking overnight in some water, and they're going to look a little bit different because they've been soaking under water. What I want you to do is, when you get one, I want you to open it up, like a book. Dig your thumbnails into the side of the seed and open it up very carefully, and I want you to look inside. That's what the magnifying glasses are for. I want you to be able to tell me what do you find inside the seed? Everyone clear? Go ahead, one person from each table come up and get a couple of seeds?\u000a  How many?\u000a Oh, you know what? Get maybe three of them in case one of them doesn't work. We have a spare. Three not unbroken, nice plump seeds. Take them to your seat. I just want you to look at them.\u000a  They're bigger.\u000a  They are bigger, aren't they? What else are they?\u000a  They're sort of hard.\u000a  They look like mandarin oranges.\u000a   Why's that,  what makes you think they're like oranges?\u000a  They're not hard anymore!\u000a They're no what?\u000a  They're not hard anymore.\u000a They're not hard.\u000a  We grew them last year.\u000a What's that?\u000a  We grew them last year.\u000a Oh, you grew these last year. What do these turn into?\u000a  Farmer's .\u000a  They turn into plants?\u000a  What are we supposed to be looking for?\u000a  Well, you tell me. Don't break them open. Here's how I want you... Can I borrow this? Okay, I want you to go to the round part here, and you notice it has like a seed coat?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay, you know kind of peel that back.\u000a  Oh cool?\u000a And then open it up like a book. Okay?\u000a  I'm looking at the skin.\u000a  Like this?\u000a  Yeah, open it up like a book and look inside and see what you find. There's a little surprise there.\u000a  What is this?\u000a  It's a bug!\u000a  It's located... yeah.\u000a  Oh, gross.\u000a  Mine's already broken so.\u000a  Well, you have a good one right here. This is perfect.\u000a  Oh I see it.\u000a  Look at that. That's a really good one.\u000a  I don't see it.\u000a  Yeah, go ahead break it. Just like you did.\u000a  I can't open it.\u000a And oh, yours is right here. Yours kind of fell apart. Do you have another seed? Be there in a second.\u000a  Okay.\u000a Oh, there it is right there. Do you see that?\u000a  I don't have one.\u000a Look at it very carefully with the magnifiers. What do you have? Let me see what you got. Yeah, right there. There's actually part of it right here, broke in half and that's attached, and there's also a little bit here. Perfect, look at this, Patrick. That's what you want to look at.\u000a  I can't open mine.\u000a  See it, see it there? What do you see?\u000a  I don't see it.\u000a  Oh, there is a little bit of green there, isn't there?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Who else is having trouble?\u000a  Me.\u000a  I already opened mine.\u000a  Yes you did.\u000a  Are they supposed to smell bad?\u000a  Yeah, they do kind of smell, don't they?\u000a  Yeah, they smell.\u000a Did you see that whole thing right on the tip? Look at that under the magnifying glass. Okay, okay look at my photograph up here. Here we go. This is kind of what you're looking at. You have these two like little half circles, little kidney shaped starchy figures, but what is this thing right here?\u000a  It's a seed. It's starting to sprout.\u000a What is it?\u000a  It's a start of a lima bean.\u000a I thought this whole thing right here.\u000a  It's the start of a lima bean plant.\u000a  This is like a plant sprouting out. Is that what you're trying to say Steven? What's that? Is there anything about this that makes you look like a plant or makes you think it might be a plant?\u000a  Like that, like the big parts might be like, maybe like the soil or the stuff that needs to get bigger? Like when we add water to stuff it starts to get bigger?\u000a  Well, did you notice there are two parts to it?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Yeah, it like goes down?\u000a  There is, what's this right here?\u000a  It's the sprout.\u000a  Okay, I heard you say it looks like a stem. Anybody think it looks like anything else? Uh-huh? Go ahead, McKenzie? Why are these pointing here? Why are these pointed?\u000a  It's kind of new.\u000a  That makes sense.\u000a  Looking to break through.\u000a  Break through the...\u000a  The soil.\u000a And what breaks through the soil? What part of the plant breaks through the soil?\u000a  The seed?\u000a  The root?\u000a Does it look like a root?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a How many people think it looks a little bit like a root? And this looks a little bit like a stem. What does this look like to you?\u000a  A flower.\u000a Let me see, it looks like this and there's another one that kind of looks like that. What does that look like to you?\u000a  Leaves.\u000a Leaves. What do leaves, okay. Do you ever see anybody draw pictures? Whats that?\u000a  It looks like a carrot.\u000a  It looks like a carrot,  doesn't it? Okay, look at those leaf like structures very carefully with your magnifier. I want you to look for a detail. You see a little characteristic.\u000a  Oh I see it, I see it!\u000a What do you see?\u000a  I see like the veins of a leaf.\u000a Wonderful.\u000a  I don't. Oh yeah, I do.\u000a Wonderful, you have little veins there on the leaf? Yeah, you can see.\u000a

V A prediction on the weather temperatures.\u000a Okay so maybe they can predict something that's going to happen.\u000a Yes.\u000a  Okay. So, based on the information that you collected is there any information, let's say you could go out the next day. What do you think, based on what you saw, what do you think might happen the next day?\u000a It might go back down into the 30s or the 20s.\u000a  Okay, and what makes you say that?\u000a Because there's more 30s and 20s then there are 50s and 40s. And, then there was a large spike so.\u000a  Okay, so it got warmer. But you're saying because most of them were cooler, it might get cooler again?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay, so you're making a conclusion. You're using your data to support that. Shaun, what are you thinking?\u000a I was thinking that maybe they might want to track it, because maybe weather can, not evolve over time, but how much it's changing and predict what's gonna happen.\u000a Okay, so you're thinking like a meteorologist or a scientist might make a forecast, make a prediction, so you're thinking sort of like Hava. And were your temperatures similar to her, or were they very different? because you might have been at two different stations. What do you think might happen on the next day?\u000a I think it will drop down to the 30s, because I see that it's dropping down, it's going up, and then it's dropping down. I think it's gonna go up and then drop down again.\u000a Okay, and it does look like you had kind of a trend here. So, what do you think if you had a day that went down, do you think it might go up again?\u000a Mhm.\u000a Might peak up again? Okay. Is there anybody else who's looking at their data thinking of what else might happen with that temperature change? Madison, are you looking at something? Yeah, what do you think?\u000a Well, with the wind speed and it would be like 8.5 for quite a few times a day. Sort of shot up into\u000a So what do you think that was indicating?\u000a That it was a very windy day.\u000a A very windy day, okay. So you guys, some of you look at your charts if you were, Madison was in Group A, and can you make a connection, or H. Madison, can you make a connection to your wind speed really spiked. On that same day did you have any difference, or did you have something happen in your temperature?\u000a Well, the temperature was about 20 degrees and because of the wind was making it cooler.\u000a Okay, so you're saying that you think that the wind also has an effect on the temperature?\u000a Mhm.\u000a Okay, so was there anybody else in Group H that recorded that sort of thing? You had a big windy gust, you had a very windy day, your temperatures went down? Did you have a similar thing happen to you Hava?\u000a Yes.\u000a Yes, okay. So you guys, why would we want to track something like not only temperature, but also the wind speed? Jada?\u000a So that they can know what tomorrow's gonna be like, or what another day's gonna be like. Or for them to know if it's gonna rain or,\u000a  Okay.\u000a What the temperature is gonna do.\u000a So they want to think maybe more, you guys now your thinking, Jada, you're even putting together precipitation? So maybe there's a consequence of precipitation?\u000a No, with low temperature and maybe heat can evaporate some water and then the next day it can get dropped down and get colder.\u000a Okay, so maybe a connection with the precipitation, temperature, those sorts of things. Okay, Katie O. What are you thinking?\u000a I would think that they wouldn't just want to track the temperature, but they'd also do the wind speed because wind speed can change how, what the temperature is, and how it changes.\u000a So why do you think wind speed makes a difference with temperature? What are you making the connection with? What's your evidence?\u000a Well wind speed I think would change like it wouldn't make it warmer, it would make the temperature feel colder.\u000a Okay.  So why do you think that?\u000a Because the wind...\u000a Well you go out to the playground a lot, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a And when you guys are on the playground and it's really windy, is it warm?\u000a No.\u000a Okay, so maybe are you thinking like when you go out there and it's really windy and you don't have a coat, does it feel cooler to you?\u000a Yes.\u000a Does it on sometimes?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Alright, so maybe they're maybe a prediction. And so you were saying they, so are you thinking scientists and meteorologists are trying to put those two together, those phenomenons?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, so Katie O, let me ask you, if this was a hypothesis that you were saying, if it's windier, then it may be cooler. You guys agree as a class? Okay thumps up, thumbs down, what do you guys think? Yes, no, maybe, a little bit there? Alright, Josh, what are you thinking?\u000a I was saying that if people are always looking at the temperature so we know what's gonna happen, when it's gonna happen, what we can expect, what we need to do.\u000a Okay.  So we're taking that forecast even further maybe? So let me kind of pose another question real quick before I keep going you guys. Let me ask you, you guys remember when you went on the computer and you watched the hurricanes? And you tracked the hurricanes? So was that data indicating the speed or the movement of the hurricane?\u000a Yes.\u000a Yes? So, does a meteorologist even track something like that to be able to maybe help people?\u000a Yes. Okay.  So do you guys remember when the meteorologist came to visit us? You guys remember that? And he really talked to us a lot about tornadoes, didn't he? But, he was also giving us situations of how we know a tornado might be forming, right? So, yeah, does that make sense, that that might be another reason that they start tracking? So think and talk to your shoulder partner. Besides a hurricane, what else might they track to, like Josh was saying, to prepare us for, to let us know. So talk to your shoulder partner. \u000a The weather because some people can know what to like my hands.\u000a Yeah, or like tornadoes.\u000a Yeah, or maybe even thunderstorms.\u000a Or the normal weather. Very intense temperatures, we can already know.\u000a Maybe even like snow, because that can be a really heavy and or kind of get everywhere like snowbound us.\u000a Or it could like be rain, snow, hail. \u000a  So what do you think Emily, what else can we determine? \u000a Snow storm. Or a tornado.\u000a Or a earthquake.\u000a So what were you thinking first Alexis, and then we'll come back to Nick?\u000a I was thinking either a tornado or blizzard snowstorm.\u000a Okay.  So what kind of weather do you think they're tracking in order for us to be prepared about weather. What do we?\u000a Wind.\u000a Wind, maybe.\u000a And temperature.\u000a Snow.\u000a  Okay, so if we're looking for just a tornado, maybe temperature, maybe the wind.\u000a Yeah, what kind of wind is it, is it cold or hot, yeah.\u000a Okay, hot and cold fronts. And then we were thinking about, what else Nick?\u000a I would say a flood because maybe maybe the clouds are coming and there's going to be a bunch of rain. Like you said, that we could get a flash flood.\u000a Okay.  So and are you making that connection to maybe our area that had a fire, and so we have to think about would there be, because it can't absorb the moisture. Okay, so that's another idea. So how would meteorologist or scientists, how would they Austin, how would they predict maybe a flood happening? What do you think they'd use? What kind of information would they be looking at?\u000a Well if a rainstorm was coming, because that rain would cause a flood.\u000a  Okay, so a large amount of rain, that would make sense yes.\u000a Or snow.\u000a Or even if we had a lot of snow. So if we had large amounts of snow, what could we possibly be warning people of, if that was the case? Alexis, what do you think?\u000a Stay inside or wear warm clothes if you go somewhere or something so they don't get so cold.\u000a  Okay, so would you guys say, would one of you formulate some sort of a hypothesis about snow coming if there was?\u000a If there was enough cold air. And some times when it's raining it starts to hail, and then it starts to, sometimes it starts to snow.\u000a So, if there's cold weather and clouds, then we might have consequences.\u000a Snow, or rain, or yeah.\u000a  of hail, or heavy snow?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, so we'd wanna keep that in mind. And does that seem to happen in our areas?\u000a Sometimes.\u000a  Sometimes. And sometimes when we make that forecast, and then maybe it doesn't come.\u000a That happened on Saturday.\u000a  Okay, so if it does come, what happened on Saturday, Austin?\u000a I think it was really humid out at first,\u000a  Mhm.\u000a And then, it started to rain, and then a lot of times usually rain starts out as ice and then it melts. And it started to get colder and then it started to hail.\u000a  So then we have the consequences of a hailstorm. Didn't last Saturday, did it start out really nice first?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah, and then also happened yesterday too, because when I got picked up it was nice and warm and everything. And then when I got to my house it was all windy, and then it started raining. So I was like, I thought it was supposed to be hot today.\u000a Right. So is it possible to use forecasting information and still be wrong?\u000a Yes. \u000a Well in the weather book, it explains the rating of tornadoes. So I'm thinking tornadoes, or something to track like the wind speed if it's gets too crazy, it get like wind miles per hour, and how bad it is. Like if the wind speed's really high, then it can cause a tornado. Like the scale. \u000a So they use that information. We were just talking and showing the things that they might be using for information that they're collecting to do what now? To give to the what?\u000a They're doing it to give us warnings. They can't tell us that a tornado's happening prior to it,\u000a  Right.\u000a So they have to warn us about them. And so I think they collect the data from that to do that.\u000a Okay, and then Reagan, what were you connecting that with?\u000a I was connecting it with a blizzard or snow storm, because if there's a delay and you need to go somewhere, you can know that there might be delays. And if you're gonna go outside you need to wear a coat, a heavy coat.\u000a Okay, so how do we respond, how do we react to it, good. Okay, you guys I was going around, and I heard some excellent conversations. And so I think you guys made strong connections with your data. And probably with your meteorologist visit, what they were telling you, and how you were putting that information together. So I want you guys to go ahead and pick up your pencils. And write underneath your graphs, I want you to answer this question. What does your data tell you? So write there on underneath your graph, or write on your graph, you could even write right in the middle of your graph, I want you to write what is your graph actually telling you? So is it telling you that you had a series of cold days? Make your prediction. So go ahead and take a minute or two, write down what your data tells you and then what changes did you observe? What was the most significant change that you observed? If at all possible, while you're writing that, you can come up with a hypothesis about your data. It could either be your wind speed, or it could be your temperature. Write down what it is that actually took place. Yeah, you want to answer the question, what does your data tell you? What changes did you observe? On either graph or you can even write a sentence that combines the two of them together.\u000a So mine says, I added a little more. It says, it is telling me all about my wind speed, and how it's going high or low, or high. What does your say Austin?\u000a Mine is, it had cold and hot days. And it went from 44 degrees Fahrenheit to 20 degrees Fahrenheit.\u000a  So go ahead, just like Alexis and Austin shared, go ahead and share with your face partner this time, so that you change who you're talking to. So Emily and Madison, you can also share what you wrote.\u000a It tells me that some times it can be hot, and then go down to a little bit colder, and then it goes back into hot.\u000a Yeah, that's what I was kinda saying when I told the wind speed, because it's not always wind speed. Yeah, it's not always wind speed, but most of the time when we took it, it was mostly in the winter so it would mostly go down. Like, it was 40, then it was 25, then it was 20, and then it was 30, and then it was 30, and then it was 40, and then it was 50. So, that's what.\u000a  So John what did you figure out from your data?\u000a I figured out that it was colder the week we were doing this.\u000a  Okay.\u000a And the wind speed was not very high.\u000a  Okay, oh yeah, yeah. So you were in an area that maybe was more protected by the wind, do you think?\u000a Yeah, we were behind the building.\u000a  Oh okay, so that might of had an effect too?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, did you draw any conclusions from that?\u000a I forgot to do that.\u000a Okay, great. Braden, tell us a little bit about what you observed from your data?\u000a Well, I observed that I did not get much wind speed.\u000a Okay, so where was your station? Were you at a protected area as well?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay, so that definitely had an effect, didn't it?\u000a Yes.\u000a So as a meteorologist, would you want to be able to put your anemometers somewhere where you know you're gonna catch the wind?\u000a Yep.\u000a  Okay, so that was a really important lesson right there, too. So what about your thermometer readings, since those weren't dependent necessarily on being protected from the wind. What can you observe from your thermometer reading?\u000a Well, that it was and then on Tuesday and Wednesday it got colder.\u000a Okay, so it got colder on Tuesday and Wednesday. So if you were making a prediction, what do you think would happen on this day, based on your data? Do you think it's gonna change, stay the same, what do you think?\u000a Stay the same.\u000a Seems like it's gonna stay the same, because you have that pretty consistently?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, alright. Tariq, what do you find from your data? What did you discover observing?\u000a I noticed that for my temperature I had up and down weather.\u000a  So your temperature was, would you say it was fluctuating?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, why do you think that was happening?\u000a Because, well it was cold on the days we went out, but where we were the sun was kind of coming towards us, at the times we went out.\u000a  So do you think that had an effect on your thermometer as well?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Hm, okay so then that's another thing as a meteorologist, you might want to think about where your thermometer is, right? Are you just getting straight sun? Okay, was there something else you were gonna say about your wind speed?\u000a Well, my wind speed. On Monday we got a lot. And on Thursday we got a lot. On the other two days we didn't get any wind.\u000a  Not too much, okay.\u000a Then.\u000a Then I also had,\u000a  Go ahead.\u000a All three of us were in the same group.\u000a  You were in the same group, alright. So there you go.\u000a And, I also had to say that my wind speed was never below 20 degrees.\u000a  You to pull out your sheet, right there that you have about your temperature on the moon. I want to ask you one more question. And I want you to think about your temperature on the moon. Now did you actually go to the moon to get your data?\u000a No.\u000a No, but let's look at the scientists who recorded that data. Why was it important for them to find out the temperature on the moon? And as you look at it, did it change very much? So why was it important and did it change very much? Okay, Jaime.\u000a I thought that on one of the missions that it was different temperatures. Like it would be and then it dropped down to about 200.\u000a Okay, and so you're specifically talking about the day?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay. And so you're saying is it pretty similar? Is that you're saying?\u000a Pretty similar, but not very.\u000a Okay, so.\u000a The main thing is that it didn't stay the same.\u000a Okay, it didn't seem to stay the same.\u000a No.\u000a  Okay. And then we had, not only day temperature, but was the other temperature that we looked at on the moon?\u000a Night.\u000a Nighttime, okay. So what were you thinking about that Shaun?\u000a I kind of had the same data as Jamie did.\u000a  Okay.\u000a Because it switched every single mission. So on mission 11 it was well 200 and about 13 degrees.\u000a  Okay.\u000a And it just kept on going down and up each mission. So it changed significantly each mission.\u000a

V Love the many questions that you're asking. Asking questions is a great way, especially if you're wondering something. Feel free to ask it, even if you go in a little bit different direction. Also, the more you reference the book, you can give us some things going on in "Brave New World" and the more specific you can be, the better that helps us understand somebody actually connected to the book and maybe how it's connected to them. So two things to be thinking about. But if you give examples, the more specific you can, of real world examples also the better off. You guys are doing a fantastic job, though. Talking, having a natural conversation, letting each other speak and all that. So, continue with the next question.\u000a Are we doing that on here?\u000a What's that?\u000a Are we doing what we're supposed to in here?\u000a Yeah, and my outside people, ya'll are doing fine continue with whatever you want to put on here. As long as it's related to the conversation, obviously.\u000a Ya'll want to talk about Bernard & John now?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Absolutely.\u000a Alright, how do these characters show a variety of ideas about individualism and conformity? I'll just kind of start out. Here's my answer, I kind of said that they were like, the Russians who wanted their blue jeans. They knew what they wanted and they kinda went for it. And in the end, society pretty much pushed them back into their place. And was like, "No, don't stand up and rise up against us."\u000a Well, I would say, I see a similarity between, like, Bernard and John because they both had individual ideals but I definitely that John was a lot stronger in his beliefs than Bernard was because I think about how Bernard had, at first, he was all individual and he had these individual beliefs and then when he, when they got in trouble, kind of in a way, all three of them, with the uprising and all that kind of stuff. He kind of went back on what he was saying. And John, he stuck to it, like he actually did something about it. When he actually kind of protested and he was able to go back to being an individual. And he went into doing his own thing, with his own beliefs. So, I just feel like John was a lot stronger in what he believed throughout it than Bernard, who was kind of allowing people to look at him, put on him, worried about what other people thought about him and all that kind of stuff.\u000a That's true. Cuz like, whenever Bernard was more of I guess a weirdo, he does always, like, question society and why everybody acts the way they do. But as soon as he started being popular, he started bragging to Helmholtz about how, like right here it says, "And I had six girls last week: one on Monday, "two on Tuesday, two more on Friday, one on Saturday." So, as soon as he became just like everybody else, he started to like it far more and it mattered much to him that people like, people did what they did, like not explicit relationships and everything. So, you're right, John was stronger than Bernard.\u000a I don't think John ever conformed, he stuck to his beliefs pretty much the whole time.\u000a Yeah, he always stayed an individual like, he made sure he didn't conform.\u000a Was Helmholtz conformist or individualistic? Because he did a lot of the same things that, you know, normal people do but he also read as an idealism at times. \u000a I think he's somebody who he conformed to what he had to, just to get by. But at the same time, he had his own thoughts and believed what he believed. I just don't think he really stood up for what he believed in.\u000a So we're \u000a Yeah, I think so. It's almost like it's almost like a fair weather friend. He did what was best for him, to keep him going got hit and suffered trouble.\u000a I feel like, I don't know, maybe I'm crazy but I thought Helmholtz was like, reminds me of, this is stereotypical, but he kind of reminds me of like an old professor, you know? He, like, just like goes to work. Helmholtz has, like, good thoughts about stuff but then he didn't like, live the life.\u000a Wasn't he some sort of,\u000a He was like a top guy,\u000a professor. A psychologist, or something?\u000a He was a scientist. \u000a Alright, so kind of sticking on that topic. What about the books and how they, nobody really read how they kind of, all of the books related to, I guess, individuality and the whole world, what life was like before  was locked up. \u000a I can say the same, John was reading Shakespeare and how Shakespeare is all about, like, love and tragedy and there's like sorrow and there's also, you know, the aspect of love with "Romeo & Juliet." And how the people didn't really, Helmholtz would, his job was reading it to them and he started laughing about it because he was trained not to. So, I think if people actually read about it, you know, the feelings and how love is supposed to be. Then people wouldn't go along with how their relationships would be because they'd wanna, maybe wanna experience falling in love with someone or having that one person would cause a lot more problems with that knowledge along with seeing how people, how there's tragedy. People are becoming sad and how in the New World people are always supposed to be happy and everyone's getting along. Then in these stories, there's like love conflict and everyone is fighting and it would cause problems because from that, people could form their own individual problems and then they start to have their own individuality and form opinions and start asking questions, which leads to a lot of things.\u000a Books are they pretty much written to express those emotions in which the whole state is trying to block up anyways? That was why they're there.\u000a So, the book, do you think that the books are kind of what drove Bernard to be a nonconformist and then as he got away from reading, and he started conforming back into society?\u000a What I think happened, cuz they were saying, I think he was like bipolar or something and everyone else was like  something. He was shorter than everyone else and, I think, he was already kind of like put aside 'cause they were saying that they think he had alcohol given to him as he was a baby so that made him weird. So, all along, he wasn't like everyone else. So, he wasn't a, like, no one accepted him for who he was but whenever he got famous, or whatever, people began to accept him. \u000a Huh?\u000a He wasn't able to conform, is that what you're saying?\u000a Yeah, I don't think he was able to conform because no one accepted him for who he was, except for Helmholtz.\u000a I think if someone else was in his position, like read, even like saw a book, they probably wouldn't even try to read the way he did. They were so used to not, I don't know, not having books. I don't think the same thing would happen to somebody else. It kind of reminds me of, I don't know if you guys have seen the movie, "The Book of Eli"? How, the entire time, he's trying to hide the Bible because that one guy wants the Bible because he wants control over everybody. Because like, if he has, like everything in the Bible, he could like tell people certain things and they would just listen to him so he could be a master. Like, in this book, how everybody, like the Controllers just want control over everybody and without books, like, I think it's just another type of their control.\u000a That's a good example.\u000a Also, if you think about it, present day, a lot of people don't even read books anymore. They mostly know that they can  and you can watch the movies instead. There is also technology where you can learn about something without even actually having to read the book. So, do you think in a way, that's kind of like the same way of eliminating, how they did in the story and how they eliminate books and there's more technology is like a weakness? Today, you know, we're all about technology so we eliminate more books and there's more movies and more technology.\u000a Real quick, I wanna throw in one scene that I want you guys to think about, also. You just brought up a point about if people in the world today saw these books, would they even know what to do with them? What would they think about them? We do have a point in "Brave New World" where someone does see a book that isn't used to seeing these type of books and responds to it. When Helmholtz looks at the Shakespeare that John has. So, what did you make of Helmholtz's response to Shakespeare? And what do you think that maybe suggests about people's attitudes in the World State? Especially since, the Helmholtz would represent, I guess, an enlightened view point in the World State. You remember the scene that I'm talking about?\u000a Yeah .\u000a Yeah, he started off by laughing at it and didn't, later on in the scene, he kind of hid the fact that he had read it and that he knew what was going on?\u000a I'm just wondering where it all\u000a It's page 183. \u000a Page 184 says, the second paragraph, like third or fourth line, "Helmholtz said listen to the "scenes of the world first meeting with a puzzled interest." I mean, I guess being the enlightened thinker, Helmholtz is kinda curious about it, and wanted to know more. But at the same time, he had that conformity which was kinda scaring him away from it. Cuz he didn't want to get in trouble, I guess.\u000a He doesn't really seem to understand what's going on in "Romeo & Juliet" because at the bottom of page 184, same page we saw him laughing about it because he didn't understand why the mother and father are trying to force the daughter on someone she didn't want. So, I mean, it just kind of shows how different things were.\u000a I guess that goes back to the differences in society between then and now. For now and the future.\u000a Like to do the last comments about John or Bernard comparing and contrasting?\u000a I come up with something that didn't really get mentioned John, the reason he's an individual is 'cause he was born, he was like literally, born and grew up on the reservation. Bernard, the reason he's an individual is because of his physical stature. So, Bernard is an individual because of physically, but John is different because of who he is. He was born like that, so that's what makes, they're two different people in individuality standard. And that's why, I thought that Bernard was so easy to go back to conformity, because the only thing that made him different was his height. And that's why John couldn't because of who he was.\u000a I thought Bernard was the person that John would be if John had been born and raised in his World State where Bernard had. The only thing that made John different is that he spent so much time on the reservation where everyone's different. They value individuality.\u000a You had some good ideas, just to kind of wrap up with that last question. Something to think about also, you guys kind of hit it on this, essentially what we have is two characters in Bernard and John that both do not fit into their communities. Right? And the world is saying everything is designed to fit exactly, and if you don't fit, then you're removed from that situation. And, the Savage Reservation, you are basically shamed out of that group. Now, that's the way John, he's trying to interact but because of his mother and because of his birth, he is shamed out of it. But notice whenever John goes to the World State, and Bernard takes him and becomes a celebrity because of it. All the sudden, Bernard is very happy to be part of the World State. So, once Bernard can actually conform and gain advantage from that type of society, he's more than happy to continue on in it. John, though, being the way he is, he's never had the opportunity to conform to any kind of society and he still has that shame culture inside of him that he continues to live by the whole time he's in the World State, right? So, that's something to think about too, is not only are they isolated when they are born and different. Then what happens, when all the sudden, one of them can conform and can be a valued member of that society, which John sort of is, but it's more for him being strange and weird and exotic, then it is him being a person and being brought into it. Guys, that was a great first half. What I need you guys to do in the center circle is go ahead and log in to your computers. Outside circle people, jot down any last minute ideas you want on your paper responses. And then in just a minute, we'll switch. \u000a So, now we're taking notes, as well as having the competition on there?\u000a Correct, and did that go ok for outside folks?\u000a Yeah.\u000a It was ok to do both?\u000a We can still take notes while we're on the inner circle, right?\u000a Oh, sure, absolutely.\u000a

V Three.\u000a Oh, it makes like a cubic graph.\u000a It's like a cube.\u000a Oh, whoa, that's pretty cool.\u000a What about... what if only two of them are the same?\u000a It's like a quadratic. \u000a All right, so as we go through the investigation now we're gonna look at, try to come up with conjecture for that. Numerically, why do you think that happens? If two factors are the same.\u000a Because it makes... like,  because if you have two factors are the same that's the same as, like, squaring one of the factors.\u000a What happens if you square numbers?\u000a They become positive, I believe. So, it's always positive for that section.\u000a Very nice. Okay, keep on, keep on going with that.\u000a All right.\u000a  Just say A, B, C, D, E, etcetera. E is the zeros of the law.\u000a I'm on the first one.\u000a Why are they the same? They're squared.\u000a \u000a Go to Google Docs. See if you can do files. \u000a The file is gray.\u000a Okay, so what's gonna happen is you're gonna have a factor formula. Unlike the other one we had it instead. And what you want to look at is look at the factors, and look at the zeros. What's the relationship between the factors and zeros. You may already know what the relationship is. Can you predict what it's gonna be?\u000a That the factors tell you the zeros? Like the numbers and the factors tell you what the zeros are?\u000a And why would that makes sense to you?\u000a Oh, because when it's X and you have a number after that, that's where it is on the X axis. So, that could be where the zeros in a set right, maybe?\u000a Teresa, does that make sense to you? You look kinda confused.\u000a Like, so X minus one is... No, that is wrong then.\u000a Well here, look at your flag. Look right here. It's sittin' right here. So X minus one.\u000a So that's one. So, there's one one. And then X minus two is the there too.\u000a Oh, so it's the opposite of the form.\u000a \u000a So, if you haven't factored form then you know that it's even zero.\u000a \u000a  Yeah, yeah. It would be equal to zero right?\u000a Yeah, you're right. Remember in algebra one the zero chronic thing?\u000a Yeah.\u000a All right, so that does make sense. Does the end behavior make sense? It's in factored form, but what's the degree of that?\u000a It's three.\u000a It's the third degree.\u000a And what does a third degree, what did we learn last time.\u000a It can intersect three times.\u000a It can intersect three times. Does it?\u000a Yeah.\u000a And what's the end date?\u000a Down and up.\u000a Down and up. And it is, right?\u000a Yup.\u000a So, that makes sense.\u000a That does make sense.\u000a Why don't you try it with quadratic factor here. And why don't you put in an extra factor.\u000a Just edit that.\u000a Just add that X, whatever something we've not used yet.\u000a What's the F in this one?\u000a  The eraser.\u000a But you added this one, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So what do we except's gonna happen? How many zeros are we gonna get this time?\u000a  Four?\u000a  What's the degree? So, what should the end behavior be? Because you weren't here last time, so let's see if you pick it up. So, if it's fourth degree, what's gonna happen on the right? What's gonna happen on the left?\u000a  Both... \u000a  Good.\u000a  Yay.\u000a  High five.\u000a  Get rid of the space after the parenthesis.\u000a  Which one?\u000a  Between the parenthesis and the F. Yeah add a space.\u000a  There's not an F. See the sliders here?\u000a  This F was there to start out with. So, just delete it then. Yeah, just delete that. So, X minus E is just that.\u000a  So we expect... did it come out the way you excepted it to come out?\u000a  Yeah, there's four zeros.\u000a And if you slide those zeros, go ahead and slide some zeros and see if it still makes sense.\u000a Oh, that's good.\u000a Oh, because it changes whatever the final one would be at.\u000a So, if we had, like, X plus something, where is the actual zero?\u000a Oh, it is X plus something, it's the actual place that it is instead of the opposite of the place.\u000a So if we say X, X plus three, where's the zero?\u000a Negative three.\u000a Does that make sense? Because X plus three equals zero.\u000a Yeah.\u000a All right, what's the next question on there?\u000a Does the Y intercept change?\u000a All right, so let's look at your zeros and look at your Y intercept. As you change the sliders, does the Y intercept change?\u000a  We can't see our Y intercept, you gotta scroll out.\u000a Mr. Dillard, would you get me me the mouse over there? The silver one.\u000a Yeah, it's a lot easier to do this with a mouse.\u000a  I got it.\u000a  Other way. Because the Y intercept is...\u000a Now it might be really...\u000a Yeah, it's right there.\u000a Why don't we try making some of these factors smaller, so that we can see it a little better.\u000a  I got it.\u000a  Oh, fine. I see how it is.\u000a  Okay, can you see it?\u000a  It's like at negative 15.\u000a Okay, is there a relationship between that Y intercept and the factors? Or the zeros? Why don't you guys talk it over.\u000a  What are the zeros?\u000a  So, the zeros are, what are the zeros? And the zeros are all the numbers that are, they're the opposite of this. So, it would be negative two, four and a half, and one.\u000a  Wait, what's the Y intercept? It's 15?\u000a  Two.\u000a Yeah, it's down here. It's actually 18.\u000a And it's negative 18.\u000a Four and a half times two is nine, times two is 18 times one. It's 18. You multiply all the end numbers together and you get the Y intercept.\u000a Well, that's nice.\u000a That is cool.\u000a  But, why does that make sense? Why would that work?\u000a Why does that work?\u000a  Oh! Because to get the Y intercept, the Y intercept doesn't have an X value so you just, in order to factor this equation, you would just multiply all the end ones to get it.\u000a Oh, yeah because it's the numbers after X, like, almost...\u000a zeros... zeros?\u000a  Well, are the numbers after X the actual zeros? If it said X plus three.\u000a The roots.\u000a  X plus three, what would the zero be for that?\u000a  Negative.\u000a So, they're the inverse of the zeros.\u000a The opposite.\u000a The opposite, yeah.\u000a  You have to be careful with the word inverse because it has a lot more meaning. All right, so, if we know what the zeros are, and we multiply those and we got the Y intercept, right?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  What about A? What happens when you slide A around? Does that change?\u000a  Slide A around.\u000a  I already know what should happen.\u000a  You can just use the mouse.\u000a  I can't click it.\u000a  Move.\u000a  Oh, that's why.\u000a It changes the middle one.\u000a  Did it change the zero? Start with that. Does it change the zeros at all?\u000a  No.\u000a  No.\u000a  No, it doesn't change the zeros.\u000a  Well, okay, go back to...\u000a  It's not changing the zero. Well actually...\u000a  Well, it's just changing it's steepness.\u000a  Yeah, it's changing it's steepness and the width, but it's not changing the zeros.\u000a  Well, yeah it does, because when it's flat then every number's changed.\u000a  But when its flat, but that's only\u000a  If A is zero, since they're multiplying everything by A, then if A is zero, everything is zero.\u000a So, yeah, you have a zero degree polynomial at that point.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay, so other than when A is zero...\u000a  All it's changing is the steepness of the graph. And not changing the zeros.\u000a So, does that change the Y intercept?\u000a  Um, yes, it is changing the Y intercept. But I think it still works out as, um, you can still multiply all of them together.\u000a  Does that make sense? Check and see if it still works.\u000a  Oh, whatever A is, is A is the opposite of the Y intercept. Because if A is four then the Y intercept here is, or that might just be...\u000a Well, that's a good conjecture. Check some of the other things and see if it still works.\u000a  Um, try changing, yeah.\u000a \u000a  Yeah, no, that's not right.\u000a That would be cool.\u000a  It was just the way I had it.\u000a And, that's one of the nice thing with the sliders, because you might see a connection, but you can quickly see if it works for all cases and not just one case.\u000a  The Y intercept is six. Yeah, it's still, ah, when you change A, it's still going to effect the Y intercept, and as changing, as multiplying all the numbers together and then multiplying by A.\u000a  Does that make sense?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So, all those numbers multiplied together is still... six. Keep going with this, because the next thing we're gonna look at is what happens when some of the zeros are the same. When we use the factor more than once. Okay? Keep going.\u000a \u000a  Are we on six now?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  What happens when two or more factors are the same? So, make E and E.\u000a  I'm gonna make them all three.\u000a  I work hard for you guys, you criticize me.\u000a  Um, the E, the E. Oh, it makes the, when they're the same...\u000a \u000a  Try changing one of them. Try changing one of the sliders.\u000a \u000a  We figured that one. It just turns out to be the opposite.\u000a  So, go ahead and change one slider. Just pick one other than A. Pick B or something like that.\u000a The opposite of that variable becomes the...\u000a Y intercept.\u000a That doesn't explain the zeros.\u000a  Now, something we want to find out,\u000a Is there a relationship between the zeros and the Y intercept?\u000a Oh, there is. When you change the Y, then the zeros equal the opposite of the Y intercept.\u000a Okay, what happens if you change two?\u000a  No, it doesn't. Oh yeah, yeah it does.\u000a Oh yeah, zero does. The one that isn't the same numerical I think.\u000a  The right most zero becomes it.\u000a When you move them, the Y intercept and the zero both change at the same rate.   Because if you move, like, C steadily to the left, once C is two, negative two...\u000a  Jacob said, "Half the time, when you multiply them all together you get it."\u000a \u000a  Yeah, that's what we're discussing.\u000a \u000a  The absolute value of the Y intercept and then the absolute value of the zero, if two of the factors are the same that's in.\u000a  If all of the variables are the same except one of them, it becomes the zero, it becomes the zero and the opposite of the Y intercept.\u000a  So, now as you slide, you'll actually be able to see the Y intercept.\u000a  If you set all the variables the same and change one of them, it becomes the zero and the opposite of the Y intercept.\u000a  Okay, so on Dave's right here... \u000a  Yeah the multiplication,  in case you, like, if you multiply all the zeros together, you get the opposite of the Y intercept.\u000a \u000a  Does it have to do with the factor formula?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So, the absolute value of the...\u000a If you multiply the zero,\u000a  So, does it make sense algebraically?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Why does it make sense algebraically?\u000a When you find the factor with that new grouping you have to, it becomes the opposite.\u000a But Y intercepts, algebraically.\u000a  Because the Y intercept is when all the X's are zeros, so you're just left with the one that doesn't have an X on it. And that is the multiplication of all the factors. All the numbers.\u000a

V  Everybody's using their directions, they have their tools and their charts out! We've found today's date, so we know where we're going to record today. It's Wednesday, March Ninth. \u000a I know what numbers  down of zero mean. They are negative numbers. That's what are numbers that are down from zero.  \u000a  OK, I have most friends with their hands on their heads, I want to make sure everybody's listening and ready to move on. We can keep all of our materials out so we can actually use them. Excellent. I'm waiting on a few more people to have their hands off of their materials and on their heads, so we can concentrate on the teacher. In each group I have one team member that will be measuring temperature. If you are measuring the temperature, please hold up your tool that you'll be using. Those of you measuring the temperature, what tool are you using? Everybody?\u000a  Thermometer!\u000a  Very good! The people that are measuring the temperature with the thermometers, please line up at the back door of the classroom. When you get out there, boys and girls, are you going to be able to see the temperature as soon as you get out there? What are you going to have to do?\u000a  Look at the thermometer.\u000a  And you can also compare it to the thermometer that's been outside, so go out there and you can let your thermometers adjust to the temperature of outside. If you have a windsock and you are going to measure the direction of the wind, I would like you to line up quietly at the back door of the classroom. You guys can use the compass and work together, go ahead out and see what you observe. If you have an anemometer to measure wind speed, you may line up. If you have a ruler to measure precipitation in our rain gauges, you may line up. You may all go. And last but definitely not least, if you are measuring the . \u000a  When we look at this , our thingy goes away!\u000a  No, yours is 61!\u000a  No, it's the Fahrenheit, not the Celsius.\u000a  There's something in there.\u000a  What team are you?\u000a  66.\u000a  You guys, we need to wait for how many seconds?\u000a  It's not ready yet!\u000a  You've been doing it at home. What is it that you've been waiting?\u000a  How can it be 110? How can it be? \u000a  Now we are going to set the timer for 10 seconds and we are going to count how many times it went around. OK? So see where your  is and get ready to start counting. \u000a  Look at the bee! \u000a  I've heard both of these ladies say two. What you need to do is you need to use that chart in there and see what it means. What is the wind speed if the anemometer goes around two times in 10 seconds?\u000a  Look with your eye, with one eye, look at this one.\u000a I can't see!\u000a  I think it's going West.\u000a  When you have completed measuring, you may walk back to your group to record your data. Quietly.\u000a  I got 66.\u000a  Can we compare it to what's on the wall there, and see what we have?\u000a  It got 66, then it got 65, and then it got 64!\u000a  Victor, could you explain it all to me, why you think you thermometer keeps going down?\u000a  Because it gets colder.\u000a  And where has the thermometer been sitting all day?\u000a  In there.\u000a  And do you think it's cooler out here, or is it warmer out here?\u000a  Cooler?\u000a  Exactly! So our temperature is going?\u000a  Down!\u000a  Good! So let's go ahead and look right here to make sure we can tell the temperature from our thermometer that's been staying outside?\u000a  It's getting brown!\u000a  What do we think the temperature is there?\u000a  It says the temperature is 46 degrees.\u000a  That's probably our most accurate reading since it has been staying outside all day long. All right. You can head back in and record. \u000a  I don't know which number to choose!\u000a  The one on the outside, the whole time. \u000a  What's your --\u000a  Gym? It's on Wednesday, March Ninth.\u000a  It was West! \u000a  The wind direction was West.\u000a  The wind direction was West.\u000a  Very good. I think that you have an accurate reading.\u000a  What's the wind speed?\u000a  It's cloudy.\u000a  Wind direction, temperature!\u000a  Team Three is working together, and Team Two, and Team One! Nice job working together!\u000a  I think you have to change it.\u000a  Temperature! Victor! What was the temperature?\u000a  40 degrees.\u000a  46 degrees Fahrenheit.\u000a  It was 50!\u000a  What was the wind speed?\u000a  It's not raining.\u000a  So what did you guys think the  was?\u000a  I agree with you. Why would we forecast that it might rain? \u000a  What's the weather?\u000a  The weather is rainy!\u000a  West! Put West! \u000a  It was West.\u000a  It was West?\u000a  We found out that the wind speed, we said it went around about that many times, so how fast is the wind actually going?\u000a  Minutes!\u000a  Miles per hour? We don't go anywhere in a minute. We travel, like we said, in cars, in miles. Right? Go back to your group, they'll tell you on the chart.\u000a  My thermometer's higher than the one outside.\u000a  We discussed that while we were standing out there. Why do you think that that may not have dropped as far down or might even be going back up as you're holding it inside right now?\u000a  Because inside of you it's warm. Because you told us that it was, when you're holding the thermometer, the thermometer only feels what's around it. And if we're covering the thermometer it can't measure any more temperature, only how our temperature is.\u000a  Very good. So, Linda, if that answered your question, that's why we compared it to the thermometer that's been staying outside that we check each day. What are we going to say that the temperature was from that thermometer reading out there?\u000a  46 degrees Fahrenheit.\u000a  Excellent, so make sure you're sharing that, and each person in your group, use your data! Linda.  I think you've done an excellent job.  \u000a  OK! We have a few minutes left, and some groups are getting to the point where they have finished recording their data after working with their team members on each type of weather and using the different weather instruments. I am going to pass out your follow-up questions and you're going to use data from last week and compare it to today's data to do some equations on here, and you do not have to finish today. We will do this in our follow-up lesson in our next science lesson. OK? You may continue working. Thank you. \u000a  Write your name and date and you can put it back in your packet when you clean up.  OK, the wind direction? Who should you be asking that to?\u000a  Today's? \u000a  Last Wednesday the temperature was What is the degrees between today's temperature and the temperature last Wednesday? Write an equation. Show your work. Last Wednesday the wind speed was eight miles per hour. What is the difference between -- \u000a  You already have your paper!\u000a  I know!\u000a  We can do it by ourselves.\u000a  But it says to work as a team! \u000a  I like it! Good job! "Keep working with your team," I hear her saying. Excellent! I like how I see Brianna using her data! And Grace starting to write an equation, and Abby and Samaya have the date on their paper! You guys are all doing an excellent job!  Who is the person on your team whose job was to measure what direction it went? You should ask that person as soon as he comes back, he should have his data on his chart.  What number did you put there?\u000a  We worked together and we figured it out.\u000a  I know this one! I know this one! I know that one! One second!\u000a

V  So what about this part? Is this any different, or is this part the same as last time?\u000a  It's different because--\u000a  Well--\u000a  Let's let Rileen talk, Chris.\u000a  It's different because it's wider, and it got right to here and the other one came up to there.\u000a  It's like six more, it's like ten more centimeters than last time.\u000a  Okay. So once you guys finish with your observations, you guys can start working on collecting your data for the canyon and for the delta. \u000a  See, this part is completely dry.\u000a  It's pretty much almost half.\u000a  Water's above the side.\u000a  Watch that,  watch that, it's gonna fall.\u000a  Look at that.\u000a  It's like a boat  going down a waterfall.\u000a  That was sand.\u000a  I know. \u000a  The water has stopped going.\u000a  One minute's passed.\u000a  Thirty?\u000a Oh.\u000a  \u000a  There's a--start to get ready. It's not done playing.\u000a  It's still not done .\u000a  Well, the water--\u000a  Look at this, look at this.\u000a  I know, we're still dry.\u000a  There's a pool of water at the end.\u000a  There's a pool of water at the end.\u000a  Look at this, there's a dent, there's a dent.\u000a  Oh, wow.\u000a  Right here's dry.\u000a  Okay, why do you guys think this part didn't get any water?\u000a  Because it probably went under?\u000a  So Cameron says it went under, Xander, what were you saying?\u000a  It was going too fast and it didn't--it was probably right here, so it didn't decide to go all the way over here, and it went right here.\u000a  It formed a lake right here.\u000a  It went the easiest route. So it's got eight or nine minutes.\u000a  So, now ten, nine minutes.\u000a  Is water still draining?\u000a  Yeah, the water's still there.\u000a  When are you guys gonna decide when the end time is?\u000a  When this goes.\u000a  There's been nine minutes, right? And the water is dripping.\u000a  Last time we got 15 minutes.\u000a  The water's dripping into basin.\u000a  Last time we got 15 minutes.\u000a  So how does it all compare?\u000a  Because, um, it compares because it's almost the same, and look at, it like poured a pool or something.\u000a  Cameron, you were saying this one is almost the same? Like it took the same amount of time?\u000a  No.\u000a  No.\u000a  No, I'm saying it's getting there.\u000a  No, the other one's longer because it drained a bigger whole.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So Elondra, how was the time different for this one?\u000a  How it was like similar?\u000a  Let's hear what Elondra says.\u000a  This one went faster.\u000a This one went faster?\u000a Yeah, way faster.\u000a So you're saying it's similar, not too different? But Elondra's saying it went faster. Do you agree with her?\u000a  Yeah, and the deposition it's like way over here. Way across there. \u000a  You guys are, I think, pretty much done with your water draining now.\u000a  Okay, so--\u000a  Nine or ten minutes and it's done.\u000a  So you guys want to record your end time?\u000a  No, no, it's still going.\u000a  It's okay if there's still a little bit of water left in. Once it stops draining, you guys can put the tape over here and you guys can start taking your measurements.\u000a  Where do we get the toothpicks?\u000a  Don't we have to know what time it is?\u000a  10:30, right?\u000a  Was this when the chocolate melts?\u000a  When's the chocolate melt? Elondra.\u000a  What?\u000a  It looks like chocolate--\u000a  So are you guys ready to start taking your measurements?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Why don't you guys open up your science notebooks so you have the table in front of you, and I'll bring by a toothpick so you can get started on the writing.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  I think the widest part is right here.\u000a  Can I do the poking?\u000a  Huh?\u000a  Can I do the poking?\u000a  You guys have your measuring tape out?\u000a  We have to go get the measuring tape.\u000a  Tape that back up.\u000a  Here, our widest part is right here.\u000a  Widest part is that.\u000a  No, no, no, you're not supposed to poke it.\u000a  How long is that?\u000a  It's about to here.\u000a  Okay, we got what we need.\u000a  Go from centimeters.\u000a  Centimeters.\u000a  Aw, Cameron. Cameron, you messed it up.\u000a  That's not our longest part. Our longest part is this.\u000a  Okay, we have to redo it. Wait, where does we start?\u000a  Right here.\u000a  Here, you do the poking. Don't poke it into the thing, but how deep is it? Here, grab it.\u000a  \u000a  No, you're not supposed to do that. Remember what she did?\u000a  Okay, this right here.\u000a  It's about three centimeters.\u000a  Three centimeters.\u000a  So, depth of straight channel is three centimeters.\u000a  Okay, what do we measure next?\u000a  Okay, time to do the width.\u000a  How much was it?\u000a  Three centimeters.\u000a  Three? Okay. What's the widest?\u000a  Where's the measuring tape? Around six centimeters.  - How much?  - Six.\u000a  Six centimeters.\u000a  Six. Okay, now we need to do width of soil drop to end of stream channel. It's all this, it's all from right here.\u000a  It's from here to here. You guys, we need the tape measure.\u000a  Yeah, width, from here to here. No, it's this long. I've got it with my fingers. This long.\u000a  It's about 15.\u000a  No, it's 14 and a half.\u000a  No that's 15.\u000a  Yeah, 15.\u000a  Oh yeah, 15.\u000a  Same with the other one.\u000a  15.\u000a  It goes all the way to the end.\u000a  Yeah, length.\u000a  Okay, 29.\u000a  How many?\u000a  29.\u000a  Yeah, and depth of soil dripped at the end of end of the stream channel. Where's the toothpick?\u000a  So right here...\u000a  Right there, yeah.\u000a  Okay, where's the time?\u000a \u000a  \u000a  \u000a  Okay, so, can you hold that there? \u000a  How much is it?\u000a  Five centimeters.\u000a  How many?\u000a  Five.\u000a  Five c-m.\u000a  Okay, width of the soil dropped at the end of the stream channel. So right here.\u000a  We're gonna actually move to here.\u000a  No no, width.\u000a  Oh, width?\u000a  Looks about...\u000a  11 centimeters, maybe?\u000a  11 centimeters. Alright, length of the soil dropped at the end of the stream channel. So now we're measuring that.\u000a  Here, you can do it.\u000a  So what're you guys working on measuring now?\u000a  Length.\u000a  We've got a long length.\u000a  27.\u000a  28.\u000a  28, yeah.\u000a  28 centimeters.\u000a  Jorge, you can measure--\u000a  Now what do we measure? Depth of soil dropped at end of the--\u000a  Wait, what was it?\u000a  28.\u000a  Depth of soil dropped at the end of the stream channel.\u000a  Where's the toothpick?\u000a  I'm letting Jorge do it.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Jorge, you can do this one.\u000a  So, maybe poke it here.\u000a  Poke it in there.\u000a  Now put your finger down. Put your finger down where it is.\u000a  Slide it down until you feel the dirt.\u000a  Good.\u000a  Bring it over to Kendra.\u000a  So you can kinda see the dirt right there. That's not even a centimeter.\u000a  You start here.\u000a  Okay. That's not even a centimeter.\u000a  That's three millimeters.\u000a  So we round it down to zero centimeters.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Zero. Okay, we're all done.\u000a  No, we still have to--\u000a  "Work on your bird's-eye view picture in your notebook." \u000a  Up in the big can.\u000a  Oh no, they're over there.\u000a  Okay. The same bird's-eye view or a different view?\u000a  That's what I was going to-- \u000a  I'm especially gonna draw in here, because that's really interesting.\u000a  Really interesting.\u000a  \u000a  Did Cody just go get something?\u000a  Yes, he did.\u000a  Oh my gosh, he's so nice.\u000a  So did you guys finish taking your data?\u000a  Yeah, we're gonna do our bird's-eye view.\u000a  Before you guys look at your bird's-eye view, I want you to share. What'd you guys find from your data? So let's look at your data tables for a minute.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  It kind of made like a cave.\u000a  No, right here.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So I see the  difference right here. In the depth of the stream channel, the basic stream was actually more than the rushing river.\u000a  What was more?\u000a  Like, in centimeters, so one centimeter off.\u000a  So, Alejandro's looking at the depth of the stream channel, and the last time it was three centimeters deep and this time it was only two centimeters deep? So last time it was actually deeper. How about which one was wider?\u000a  The rushing river.\u000a  So the rushing river made a wider stream channel?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  I think the reason why it was wider is because more water came in.\u000a  It basically didn't spend enough time going in, it basically just went--\u000a  Yeah, and it made it more curved-inish and stuff.\u000a  Okay. Jorge, what'd you notice?\u000a  I noticed that, right here, it made a little cave, and I think something like water, I think there was a little whirlpool there.\u000a  Yeah, there was.\u000a  There were a bunch of whirlpools.\u000a  Yeah, there were doubles.\u000a  There's one right here and here.\u000a  So I think it broke the water  .\u000a  I saw one little whirlpool right there, and another one over here.\u000a  I saw one here.\u000a  So the water was kinda doing some different things in some of these places?\u000a  Yeah, I think it's 'cause it curves like that, so the bubbles keep on spinning if the water's coming through.\u000a  Yeah, so the water's-- \u000a  So what about the delta? The deposition? How is this different than your first experiment?\u000a  Oh my gosh, it was five centimeters bigger.\u000a  Five centimeters bigger? What'd you notice, Jorge?\u000a  The biggest part was that it was only this part right here.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Yeah, that was the longest part that was part of it all.\u000a  So Cody, I noticed that, this time, how deep was your delta?\u000a  Our delta, which would be to get that soil?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Zero centimeters.\u000a  So does that mean there's no delta? So how did you guys come up with zero?\u000a  'Cause it was three millimeters, so we had to round down.\u000a  Okay, so you guys have your data.\u000a  And the length of the soil--\u000a  It was a lot wider, wasn't it?\u000a  Yeah, the length of the soil was like four centimeters bigger. It was from the end right here and it continued down.\u000a  So you guys, remember, we're gonna take this data--\u000a  Someday are we gonna put more of that stuff in here?\u000a  Oh, put more of the earth material in?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  And see what it would be like if you added more material?\u000a  \u000a  Okay, maybe that would be a question we could investigate.\u000a  Maybe the delta would be thicker because there's not enough room for all of it.\u000a  You know why I'm asking you that? Because I think it would be deeper, because right here it only makes little ones here, but the other one would probably make it bigger because it has more space.\u000a  Okay. So you think these channels might be bigger?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  If there was more earth material?\u000a  What if we made an even bigger hole?\u000a  Oh, so you're wondering if it was an even bigger flood, what might happen?\u000a  Maybe that would be a hole like this big.\u000a  Yeah, you guys are doing that thing that scientists do after they do an investigation, they start asking more questions, "I wonder, what if we tried this." So you guys have got your data, so we'll be ready to put this in the class data table, right? Find our averages probably on Thursday? Right now, you guys are going to be working on-- you want to make sure you get the runoff sample, draw what that looks like today, we'll see what it looks like when it settles out later, and then you guys are going to work on your bird's eye view, and think about where's the humus, where's the gravel, where's the clay, so you can add that into the picture.\u000a  Hey guys, I'm gonna like--\u000a  Yeah, I was thinking the same thing, like rip this up.\u000a  Whoa, there's the biggest--\u000a  Oh, that's cool!\u000a  Ms. Maher, it made a big dip.\u000a  I'm guessing that some water's still down there.\u000a

V ...confusing for people to understand, but we're looking at density today. We're looking at how much stuff is packed in a certain area. So, if you flip over to the back of your paper, you've got that little box at the top. And it tells you one of the reasons some of the objects float while the other objects sank is because of their density. If you could write down the definition of density in your box, I would appreciate that. The amount of matter, when I say stuff, like when we were learning about solids, liquids and gases at the beginning of the year, stuff is matter. So the amount of matter that's in a certain area is an object's density. It's not its mass, it's its density. So the marble is more dense than the Styrofoam ball. Okay? So now that we know the word 'density,' we're going to start using the word 'density' for the next part.  The amount of stuff packed in a certain area, or the amount of matter. The marble had more matter in that small area than the Styrofoam ball. The Styrofoam ball is spread out and have all those air holes, making that matter more spread out, less dense. Krayla?  Yes, right now. Okay? All right. So that was simple.\u000a, I want you to go ahead and put a "C" over your 10 at the top of this if you haven't. And I want you to take a look at the part one on your paper. Yesterday, we looked at how pressure could effect the mantle, but now we need to look at something different. I want you to answer number one and two first and then we'll talk about it. This is just what you know before you come in my room to get you into the lesson. So, number one wants to know list a few things that you have seen float before. Number two wants to know what do you think might cause these things to float. So, first just make a little list of two, three things that you've seen floating before and then tell me on number two, if it's a hypothesis you may not know for sure that's fine, but what do you think causes them to float. Nathan.\u000a Are we allowed to write both?\u000a Yeah. Yeah, so right now, you're just going to make a little list on number one and then number two, you're going to tell me what do you think actually causes these things that you wrote down to be able to float. We're going to start with that first. This is just to get us thinking about what we're doing today. One and two, please. What do you think causes them to float? You might not be sure of the answer to number two, but I still want you to make a hypothesis. You don't have to write "I think because," but you can tell me what you think causes that. Number two's going to be harder than number one.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Let's take four things, tell me four things that you've seen float before. We'll take four, because we can probably sit here and name like 100. Cole, give me one.\u000a Ice cubes.\u000a Ice cubes. Sadie?\u000a Boat.\u000a A boat. Alex.\u000a Shoes.\u000a Shoes. And Emily?\u000a Dog toy.\u000a Dog toys, okay. Now, we know things can float and that's great. But, what do you think causes these things to float? Why do you think dog toys and a boat and ice cubes and things like that, why are they are going to be able to float. Ebony, what do you think?\u000a The air in them.\u000a The amount of air that's in them. Anybody else? Dylan?\u000a They are less dense.\u000a Okay. Sean?\u000a Surface tension.\u000a Surface tension.\u000a Little air pockets that are in them.\u000a Okay, air pockets.\u000a I was thinking like the less density inside of it.\u000a Okay,alright, we're going to take a look at that today. So, you've got a kind of idea, we're going to look at what causes something to sink and what effects if something floats. Alright, we have two parts that we are going to be going to our last stations for. So, let's take a look at part two last station observation. You have two setups at your lab station. You have a black tray that has three objects in it. You've got a bouncy ball, a marble and a styrofoam ball, alright? You also have a setup at your lab station that has liquids in cups. This is for part three. Alright, I don't want you touching this stuff yet. We're going to come back later and you're going to look at that stuff. I don't want any of the cups knocked over, I don't want any of the objects put into the cups, okay? These two things are separate, your black tray and the piece of paper with the cups are separate. What you're going to do first is use the black tray and the objects in it. You're going to tell me with the marble, the bouncy ball, and the styrofoam ball if we were to put these in water, which we are going to test them, but if we were to put these in water, do you think these objects would sink or float? So, you just go through and if you want you can just write an "F" or an "S." You're going to say what you think and I want you to wait until you get to your lab stations so you can pick them up, feel them to see, that might make a difference in your guess. Then, I also want you to tell me why. While you are at your lab station, float or sink in water and why. You're not going to do the did it actually float because we're going to look at that when we come back. These are our results. So, you're going to do the first two columns, float or sink, why, float or sink, why, float or sink, why.\u000a Then we are going to come to that?\u000a And we are going to come back, and we're going to do an observation together. So these two columns have got to be filled out before you get back to your seats. Got it? Let's go.\u000a Marble, sink. Rubber, float. \u000a Rubber, float. Styrofoam, float.\u000a The marble will probably sink, it's heavy.\u000a It has no air in it.\u000a Bouncy ball. The bouncy ball probably can float.\u000a Yeah.\u000a I mean it's not light,\u000a It's gonna float. Bouncy ball, same thing.\u000a Bouncy ball, heavy. Marble, heavy with no air pockets. No--\u000a This one will definitely float because it's lightweight and it has these little pores.\u000a This bounces a lot,  his bounces a little bit and this bounces not at all.\u000a Yeah, but this one, but this one \u000a If this one can float, then why not think that one could float?\u000a Okay.\u000a If you don't go with your group, that's okay, but you still need to a connection. If you are finished before the timer goes off you need to come back to your seat.\u000a This will float.\u000a This will fall. \u000a Fail.\u000a If you finish, you need to come back to your seats. You guys all finished? I want to go ahead and take a look, before we see the results. Before we look at the results and test this, I want to see what we think. So first off, let's start with the marble since it's at the top. Raise your hand if you think the marble will float. Okay, so we're all together on this one, it's not going to float. Who can tell me why they're thinking it's not going to float? We'll take like three guesses, three explanations. JC?\u000a It's heavy, with no air pockets.\u000a Heavy with no air pockets, good. Frayla?\u000a It can't capture air, it can't float.\u000a Can't capture air, can't float. Alright and Emma. Heavy and solid.\u000a Heavy and solid. Alright, now what about the bouncy ball. Raise your hand if you think this is going to float. Alright, there's a mix.\u000a What, that's heavier than the marble.\u000a Well, let's hear --  Somebody give me an explanation for why it would float. If you guessed float tell me why you thought that. Sean. Because there's air inside.\u000a Okay, there's air inside. Alex.\u000a I dropped it in the pond and it still floated.\u000a Bouncy ball floated in the pond when you did it before. Ali. I've seen it happen.\u000a Okay, you've seen it happen. Now, some of us said it would sink. Why did you say it would sink? Matt Weaver.\u000a Because it's heavy.\u000a It's heavy.  Frayla.  Okay, Jared.  Okay, so prior experience. Now, last one is our styrofoam ball. Float, raise your hand. Alright, somebody give me a reason why it's going to float. We're all together on this one, too. We all agree the marble is going to sink, we all agree the styrofoam ball is going to float. Matt Cook.\u000a It's light and has air pockets.\u000a It's light and has air pockets. Alex?  You're talking alot of things, the pond was last time, okay. Frayla. It's very lightweight \u000a Okay, alright, let's test it out. We're just going to test it out upfront here, so I'm just going to use this big beaker. What do we want to see first?\u000a Marble.\u000a Bouncy ball.\u000a Alright, record sink for your actual. I guess we'll do bouncy ball, we'll just go in order. Alright, bouncy ball, ready? The moment of truth.  And styrofoam ball.\u000a Yeah.\u000a A different bouncy ball didn't float.\u000a But you saw the bouncy ball I was using, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So, it was fair, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Very simple, but let's take a look at what's going on. For number four, I'd like you to tell me, I want you to answer first and then we'll discuss. What I'd like you to tell me, why do you think some of these objects were able to float, while others were able to sink? And I want you to be specific. At the beginning, I asked you the same question on number two in prior knowledge. Why do you think some of these things float. I want you to revisit that question again. So, why do you think the marble and the bouncy ball sank and the styrofoam ball was floating. I want you to be specific on number four. I want you to answer first on your paper and then we're going to share, okay? What kinds of things did we say for number four? Now that we've looked at this in a different way. Before, I just asked you to think of things in your past that you've seen float. Now, we've looked at our marble, our bouncy ball and our styrofoam ball. What did you say? Nick.\u000a Bouncy ball didn't have enough air to keep it up and it was too heavy.\u000a Okay, anybody else say anything. Nick said, bouncy ball didn't have enough air to keep it up so it sank. Anybody say something different? Ebony?\u000a Density and buoyancy.\u000a All right, what do you mean density and buoyancy? Okay, Frayla?\u000a I said that some objects had air holes and some were just solid.\u000a Okay.  Now let's think of this in a different way. We've got this really small marble and we've got a much larger styrofoam ball. So, normally if something's smaller, you think it's going to be lighter, it should float. Something heavier, this is much larger, but it didn't sink. If I have one book, if I'm carrying one book versus carrying five books, that's different because five books are bigger than one book. So, what is going on with the amount of stuff in the marble and the amount of stuff in the styrofoam ball. Is it the same amount of stuff in the same amount of space? Does the marble have the same amount of stuff in the same amount of space that the styrofoam ball does? Which one has more stuff, more matter in a smaller space. I want you to talk with the person sitting next to you for one minute. Okay, so, we've done this before. Okay, so, marble's number one, styrofoam ball, two. Which object has more stuff, more matter, packed in a smaller space? On the count of three, right here, marble one, styrofoam ball two. One, two, three.\u000a Marble. Good, marble. So, let's write that down. This is pretty much what number five is asking you. So, when comparing the marble to the styrofoam ball, which one has more mass, more matter, more stuff in a smaller amount of space, which we call volume. That would be the marble, alright. People today, if you flip over to the next part, I've heard the word density a couple times and density is kind of.\u000a

V Can you make some shadows? I see light, how will you make a shadow? How are you making a shadow? How are you making a shadow Alicia?\u000a My hands.\u000a What is your hand doing?\u000a Making a shadow.\u000a How is it making a shadow?\u000a I don't know.\u000a How is it making a shadow Brandon?\u000a Because your hand is stopping the light.\u000a Your hand is stopping the light.\u000a And it's small 'cause your hand is far away from your body and... More light comes around your hand.\u000a What happens if you move it close to the light?\u000a It has it big because it stops more light. because it stops more light.\u000a It's stopping more light, you're right. Let's go see what these guys are doing. What are you guys doing?\u000a Blocking the light from the light in there.\u000a You're blocking the light? How are you blocking it?\u000a We're going forwards and backwards to make it little.\u000a So I see your shadow is changing. How is it changing?\u000a Because you're closer to the light and then you're... When you get close it gets bigger.\u000a It gets bigger?\u000a And when you're far it gets littler.\u000a Okay, why does that happen? What's happening when you're down here?\u000a It gets big.\u000a It gets bigger.\u000a Why does it get bigger? What happens to the light?\u000a The light can't go through your hand.\u000a And and and it's blocking it.\u000a It's blocking more light? What happens over there then?\u000a It's blocking a little bit of light.\u000a Okay.  So more light gets around it, right? Alright very good. Can you guys make different shadows?\u000a It's a turkey.  That looks like the red nosed reindeer.\u000a  The red-nosed reindeer? How are you changing your shadow?\u000a You have to make shapes of the animals.\u000a I don't know what to make.\u000a  That's okay, make anything you want. You guys go ahead, make 'em big and small, and I'll be back in a little bit. Duwant is helping you.\u000a Duwant!\u000a What's happening over here? Doing some measuring? What are you measuring? How come you guys are measuring down here, and not in the window?\u000a Because....\u000a Are you able to see the box? how come you're not measuring the fifth one? Where's the sun?\u000a The sun is on the other side.\u000a Other side of the building? Way over there? So we can't measure the shadow sticks today, can we? That's why you're making shadow sticks on the ground? Okay, show me a shadow stick. Okay Bristava you can handle the light, what can you do? Can you hold the stick up for us, Julie, to make a shadow? Okay, can you do the measuring? Okay, go ahead and measure it. Put your hand down here so we can see the top. Can we measure that stick? No we're gonna measure the shadow. You wanna measure the stick first, and then compare it to the shadow? Okay. You gotta hold that real still, don't you? Is your light high or low?\u000a Low?\u000a It's lower-- what happens if you put it lower, what happens to the shadow?\u000a It turns big.\u000a It grows.\u000a It grows? It gets longer. What if we put it high?\u000a It's gonna be fat.\u000a Gonna be short? is the shadow longer or shorter than the stick? I need to you to measure it. Okay, let's record it. You measure the shadow. Measure the shadow. Whoops! 'Scuse me! Let's measure the shadow, measure the shadow. Is that long enough or do you need another? Hold it still Bristava. Is that long enough? Is the shadow longer or the stick longer? Let's compare. There's the shadow measurer and there's the stick. What do you notice?\u000a It's the same size.\u000a It's the same size, it sure is. What if you did it down here though? Would it be the same size if you put the ball down here? No, the shadow would be much longer wouldn't it? Good work guys, keep measuring! Try a different stick, use that pointer stick. Or another stick. Here's a stick. Here's some more sticks for you to try. \u000a I'm done with these things already.\u000a it's okay. Okay, what are we doing? Can you guys guess what that is?\u000a Scissors!\u000a How did you know it was scissors?\u000a Because the shadow.\u000a Okay, the shape of the shadow told you, didn't it?\u000a She put on some blocks.\u000a Okay.\u000a No. Oh, she says no it's not blocks. Is she tricking you?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Sometimes the shape is hard to tell, can you guess?\u000a Adam, no.\u000a Take a look at this one, Adam. Take a look at this one, oh nope, not from up here. What do you think that is? Know what this is? Bryce? What is that one? Can you tell from the shape what this one is?\u000a Gluestick.\u000a A gluestick you're right! Good guessing, how could you tell?\u000a Shadow of the lid.\u000a You saw the shadow of the lid? Good job.\u000a Bryce's turn.\u000a Okay, now are you guys gonna play the takeaway game? Okay. Remember, she's gonna put a whole bunch of objects on there, sit down, and you grab a good long look and then close your eyes and she'll take one away, and you'll have to guess what shadow is missing. Okay? Alright, what are we doing over here, guys? What are we doing? You're making shadows?\u000a Shadows\u000a You're checking out different materials?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay.  So what is that one, Shelby, what did you find out about that one?\u000a Goes through.\u000a What goes though? What goes through?\u000a The light.\u000a The light goes through, so does it make a shadow?\u000a Yes?\u000a Which part of it makes a shadow? Boys and girls, check your voices please? Thank you.\u000a This part.\u000a Okay, that thick part makes a shadow, doesn't it? What about the thin parts? Doesn't make a shadow does it? The light goes right through. What else did you try? What are you trying Takori? Tell me about it. Show me. Why don't you try this, Trayshawn. But wait, Takori was trying something! Just a minute. What have you got, Takori?\u000a A tissue.\u000a It's what?\u000a A tissue.\u000a A tissue? Is the light going through it? Or did it stop the light?\u000a Stopped the light.\u000a It stopped the light, so it made a shadow, didn't it? Did it make a light shadow or a dark shadow? A dark one. Okay Trayshawn, your turn, what are you trying?\u000a The box.\u000a is it stopping the light? Get back here so you can see. Put it down here. Can you see it? What do you see about it?\u000a It's making a shadow.\u000a Which part is making a shadow?\u000a The whole thing.\u000a is that a dark shadow or a light shadow?\u000a A dark shadow.\u000a Is this part dark or light?\u000a Light.\u000a Okay why is this part light?\u000a Becuase it is a light shadow. Can't hear you babe.\u000a Because it's a light shadow.\u000a Why is it a light shadow? Why isn't it a dark shadow? What's happening to the light? Some of the light going through it?\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a What do you think, Cooper? What's making that shadow?\u000a Um, the light.\u000a Okay, the light is making the shadow. What are we using, what is this?\u000a A box.\u000a Okay, is it clear or colored?\u000a Clear.\u000a Okay, so what happens to the light?\u000a It goes through.\u000a Okay, it goes through it, doesn't it, so it only makes a little bit of a shadow. Good job. Did you guys write the things over here, did you find anything new to write down? Let's try that Shelby. You and Cooper come over here and try that. Okay Cooper, you may go to the bathroom. What do you see, Shelby?\u000a Sorry.\u000a You see a light shadow? Why is it light?\u000a 'Cause it goes right through.\u000a Is any part of that dark?\u000a This part.\u000a That part? Why do you think that part's dark?\u000a 'Cause it has a wrapper.\u000a The wrapper, and what's the wrapper doing to the light?\u000a It's stopping the light and it's making a shadow.\u000a Exactly. Very good Shelby, thank you.  Go right here, okay? What's our time?\u000a We have two minutes left.\u000a We might wanna go back and see-- Hey what'd we find out? Raja, what are we doing here?\u000a Measuring.\u000a What's your shadow doing? Can you change your shadow? How do you change your shadow?\u000a By moving.\u000a By moving? By moving the object? How else could you change your shadow? What about the light? What would you do with the light?\u000a Move it?\u000a Move it? I'll hold your stick, and you move the light. How is your shadow changing? Getting bigger? What else could you do? Move your light some more. Move it up or down. Ooh, what happened to the shadow? It got shorter? Oh, now what's happening? Got longer, didn't it. This is making a shadow that's easy to see. Look at that shadow. When the light is high, the shadow is?\u000a Shorter.\u000a Short. And when the light is low, the shadow is? Alright now measure that. Measure that. How many cubes lie on that shadow?\u000a One, two three, four, five, six, seven.\u000a Is the shadow longer or shorter than the stick? Longer or shorter than the stick?\u000a The same.\u000a Oh it's the same! I think our--\u000a

V  Do you want to measure this separately? Or do you want to measure this with the ground water?\u000a  Should we measure this separately?\u000a  Yea, 'cause that's the round rocks.\u000a  Okay, what were you saying Cathy? Why is the ground water cleaner?\u000a  Because the permeable rocks. They clean the water on its way down to the soil saturation.\u000a  There's 100 milliliters, and you guys, could you record the data real quick? Write. Ground-- oh no, but we've got to add this first. Yea.\u000a  Wait, we've got to add. Is it still...? But, let's do the--\u000a  Is that too much?\u000a  Let's do the answer for number one while we're on it.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  It says,\u000a  Good job--\u000a  "Describe what you would do..." \u000a  Stop.\u000a  But why is your head right down level with the measurement?\u000a  We're doing that so we can make sure it's exactly even, 'cause if we go over, then we won't know exactly how much it is.\u000a  And are you measuring the runoff, or the ground water right now?\u000a  Right now we're measuring the runoff. It was about 380.\u000a  It was about 380? Is it okay to get an approximate amount for the volume for this, and not an exact amount?\u000a  I think so, 'cause then when we measure this, we could still .\u000a  Exactly. Ashlyn, which had more water? Your runoff, or your ground water?\u000a  The ground water.\u000a  The ground water had more?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Yeah, 'cause they're overflowing.\u000a  Oh my goodness. Have you measured your ground water yet?\u000a  Not yet, I think you can see it for video.\u000a  Where is your ground water? Oh, oh I see! Oh, so this really did overflow?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  So when you measure your ground water, what will you need to do with the water that's here in the tray?\u000a  I think put it in with the ground water.\u000a  Yea, and measure that too. Okay, this is your runoff?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Okay, so so far you have how much?\u000a  About 380.\u000a  And then there's some in here.\u000a  Oh, you've already measured 380?\u000a  About.\u000a  Oh.  \u000a  So that's 100. \u000a  You are pouring that so carefully Jade.\u000a  Stop.\u000a  Good.\u000a  Because we want to have it exact so I had to.\u000a  Okay, Ashlyn. So Jade put in 100 once, and then she put 100 in a second time. So how much water has she put in there so far?\u000a  200.\u000a  How did you get 200?\u000a  Um.\u000a  Be sure you talk nice and loudly honey.\u000a  Because, I got it because... plus... it equals 200 because you put two in there.\u000a  Nice! Good job. \u000a  Looks like you're doing great kids. \u000a  60.\u000a  Keep going. Keep going.\u000a  Looks like it might have been slightly off. Better watch it go. \u000a  Okay, so, maybe if we... I think that's good but should we add the, should I add the data in now?\u000a  No, we needed that, did you pour on water, because that also . \u000a  Wow, looks like we're getting a lot of data. Your recharge is high. \u000a  Trial number one, why do you say runoff had more water in trial number one?\u000a  I think because it, clay's more harder, so it's kind of more difficult to go through with .\u000a  So what is this number?\u000a  790.\u000a  What is this number?\u000a  62.\u000a  And which is greater?\u000a  790.\u000a  Yea, 790's greater than 62. Good for you, honey. How did you get this number dear?\u000a  I think, we added them up.\u000a  What did you add up honey?\u000a  790 and 600. I mean 62.\u000a  To get this total?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Great. I have a question for this group though. How much water did you pour in on trial one? 1,000? 1,000 what?\u000a  Milliliters.\u000a  1,000 milliliters? But your total is only 852 milliliters.\u000a  It's still in the zone of saturation.\u000a  Oh.\u000a  Or it hasn't collected off the first.\u000a  Alright.\u000a  But it's interesting maybe, the water from last time, since we only had 852 ending last time? Maybe this time, the second , sort of. Maybe it, some might  against the window, if the water from last time, I wonder if it came down, in the aquifer.\u000a  I wonder.\u000a  Maybe it's just holding it in there.\u000a  I wonder, it'll be interesting to measure this time. So what part do you have in your lab note?\u000a  We're adding, we're have to answer question two, and then we're measuring . "Describe what you observed when you poured the water over the ground water the second time. What changed? Taylor, you go first.\u000a  Um, well, I think what changed is, since the clay sort of got use to the water the first time, and there wasn't very much water on the recharge water the first time, and it got used to, the clay got used to the water, that there are little cracks, or the water slipped through the sides and it went, and now we've got more recharge water than we had on our first one.\u000a  Do you think that could happen in real life? Do you think we could have an impermeable surface like clay, and then, it could crack and let water through? Why do you think that could happen in real life? Some place that might happen for real?\u000a  A bunch of pressure? If it rains for like, millions and millions of years, maybe like cement, or gravel? It would break it down, and it would have like a little.\u000a  Do you remember the term for that?\u000a  Weather rock.\u000a  Yeah!\u000a  Weather rock.\u000a  Like, what's in the middle of the road?\u000a  Yeah, sure, yeah.\u000a  Because when people drive on it, it gets so much pressure. And people keep driving on it, and it cracks sometimes.\u000a  Sure. And I'm sorry, I interrupted you when you were answering question number two.\u000a  I wonder if the, I doubt anyone would do this, but if we put pollution on clay,\u000a  If you put what, honey?\u000a  Pollution on like, cement of something, I would wonder if it would get through. Like, sort of like water sometimes, and since the clay's impermeable, water can't get through it easily, but I wonder if pollution would.\u000a  That's a good question, you might want to do that experiment when you're done with this one. That'd be great to check. Good job.\u000a  The clay became more permeable the second time we added the water?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  And then we should probably measure how much is in here.\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Oh, that's kind of... \u000a  Yea because it's like, soapy.\u000a  It is sort of soapy.\u000a  I think it's because of the clay being wet. Look on this side.\u000a  Oh yeah, I can see some of the white. \u000a  So why is the  about 120?\u000a  Because it's not quite at 150, but it's a little bit over 100.\u000a  Is close, close enough for this? Or how do you know when close is close enough for this?\u000a  Um, we know when it's close enough for this, because it doesn't really have an exact measurement for 120, so we know that it's kind of half way between 150 and 100. little bit lower than 125.\u000a  There's a lot more recharge than last time.\u000a  A lot more recharge?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  We had 760, now we have 435.\u000a  Holy cow! The first time you did this, you had 760,\u000a  Milliliters.\u000a  Milliliters of runoff.\u000a  And this time we had 435 milliliters.\u000a  Oh, that is a big change! I wonder, I wonder what will happen with your recharge, have you measured that yet?\u000a  Yeah, what was it?\u000a  It was, I think it was 871.\u000a  Oh my goodness! Why do you think you had so much more recharge the second time you did this? Christian?\u000a  Probably because the ground probably got more moist, so it would make it easier to slip right through.\u000a  Do you remember the term for that? When the ground gets all wet with water?\u000a  Soil saturation.\u000a  Great.\u000a  Well yea, I mean the water level must have gotten higher.\u000a  Why do you say that?\u000a  Because the bigger the saturation is, and the higher the water table is, the more moist the ground is. The ground is so the water can go through easier.\u000a  I think the first time we did it, the water went through, which made it easier for the second time to go through. 'Cause it made it more moist. And the rock pebbles were kind of scattered around probably mixed with the water.\u000a  So that's the pattern you're seeing. What do you predict will happen on your third trial?\u000a  I'm thinking that there will be maybe, maybe possibly, more recharge than runoff.\u000a  More recharge than runoff? Did you have more recharge than runoff the second time?\u000a  No, but we always have the tape on, and it's less than 100.\u000a  So they started like this, and now they're equal, and now you think the third time they'll,\u000a  Yea.\u000a  Oh.\u000a  Because probably, since the soil's even more moist now, that it will make it go through the cracks.\u000a  And Jasper, what did your group discuss, that you observed the second time you poured in the water that was different from the first time you poured it in?\u000a  The runoff water was kind of even with the recharge.\u000a  But before you measured it, before you were just making your observations and watching, what did you observe?\u000a  That the first time, that there was there was more runoff because the dirt wasn't that moist.\u000a  Oh. Great, so that's what you wrote down for your number two? And I have a question for you Christian. How much water, are you the drain person?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  How much rain did you pour in on trial number one?\u000a  1,000 milliliters.\u000a  So this is interesting. How much did you measure after trial number one?\u000a  900.\u000a  So what happened to the rest of the water?\u000a  It stayed into the soil. \u000a  Oh! So that's why the soil's all wet. 'Cause there's still water underneath it.\u000a  So it's like\u000a  How did you get 100?\u000a  Because 900 plus 100 equals 1,000.\u000a  Good job! Alright, I'll leave you to it. \u000a  Four three five, would equal... Okay, we need to have less water than the last time.\u000a

V Okay, so ready to go here? Okay. I'd like to take you back to the fifth century. To a time when Attila the Hun was uniting the barbarian tribes and he was leading his great dark horde to conquer the lands of Gaul, or Western Europe, much to the chagrin of the Roman Empire. "But where," I hear you ask "Is Attila the Hun himself?" Well, I fear he has perished. He died in a drunken brawl, would you believe on his wedding night? And who am I, I hear you ask, to be telling such a tale? Why, I am Mrs. Attila the Hun and it has been left to me to guide the dark horde as we continue to conquer the lands of Gaul. Javelins, and bows and arrows, those were very well and good for tacticians such as Attila the Hun, but what do I know about tactics?\u000a  Not much.\u000a So I need something--\u000a  Very little, you are right! Josh the Hun is right! So, what I need is to get some sort of a war machine. Now, let's first think about what characteristics do I need in a weapon that would help us against-- to help us conquer the lands of Gaul. What characteristics do we need in the weapon? What do we need it to do?\u000a  Hurt people.\u000a In other words we need to have some sort of damage at the end of property or\u000a  Force.\u000a something else. So, a force, we need to have some sort of force.\u000a Range.\u000a What else, I'm sorry, Jackie?\u000a Range.\u000a Range, the range would be a good thing, especially if we can get beyond bow range, right? That would help out to get some of the castle walls destroyed before we even get far, right?\u000a Steph.\u000a  Efficiency? Efficiency, can you tell me more about what you're thinking?\u000a  Well, being able to complete said task without much power used in maneuvering?\u000a All right, we need to be able to move the machine around to be able to get the job done. We need to be able to not, perhaps, use every single Hun for it. So efficiency in being able to load it and being able to use it. Anything else that we need in a weapon to help us in our destroying and pillaging of towns and villages? Yes, Katie.\u000a  Possibly something that you could use again?\u000a  Oh yes, if we only use it once that's kind of a problem, isn't it? We want to be able to use it repeatedly. Good idea. Other things we want to think about? Joe.\u000a  Something that's mobile.\u000a  All right, so maybe wheels might help, or being able to be something that could be lifted or carried. Okay, those are good thoughts. Jackie.\u000a  Accessibility, like making sure it's easy to use and not like difficult to set up?\u000a  So if it takes a bunch of people and they're struggling to reset it, maybe not a good idea. Something that perhaps a few people might be able to handle. All right so we've had a good deal of ideas so far. That's really good. So, I need some sort of a war machine. Something that would have all of those properties in it. Hmmm, why, what is this?\u000a  Message for you Mrs. The Hun.\u000a  A message, okay, let's see. Why, it is news of a new siege engine called a trebuchet.\u000a  Ooh.\u000a We have a picture of our new war weapon, but here's the challenge: I need to build the best trebuchet, the best war machine that I can and I'm not certain what properties, what characteristics, what parts of this machine, I should emphasize. How big they should be, how strong they should be. So I'm going to need you to help me out. I'm going to make little groups of Huns in order to create a model of our trebuchet. Each group can then test a different quality. What sorts of things could we change to test our trebuchet, to see what would be the best one? Caroline.\u000a [Caroline} The weight on the opposite end?\u000a  All right, the weight, the counter weight and the load. Both of those things, and perhaps the ratio of them, could be rather important. Josh.\u000a  Like the ratio of the arm on either side of the axle.\u000a  All right, the lever arm and how it changes, that could be an important idea. Other things that we might be able to change, to vary or test? Anything else we might be thinking of? Kate.\u000a On the angle, right there.\u000a Ah yes, the angle and the angle of launch has a lot to do with. There's a little pin that holds the sling in position until the lever arm releases it. So the angle of launch and changing that could be important. Anything else we might try? Anything else we could change? We've had some really good ideas. All right, so I'd like to break you into your small groups and I'd like you to decide on what exactly your group is going to test. We'll come back together in several days in order to share the ideas and information. So I need you to prove your loyalty me, Huns. Build this trebuchet and test it and if Attila the Hun were here right now, he'd say, "What are you doing laying your duffs?" "Get to work, Huns!" Let's get into our small groups and see what you can decide on for your trebuchet.  And you can choose whatever it is that interests you. You can choose something that we did or something different. But what you want to remember is that you have to decide what to do before any work. You have to decide "I'm going to change this part of it" "and keep everything the same" until we take data.  Remind me, first of all, what it was you were changing.\u000a  Counterweight.\u000a  Counterweight, so you're leaving the same object that you're launching?\u000a  We're just changing counterweight.\u000a So, what, is that your weight?\u000a Yes.\u000a  Okay, so what challenges did you have, if any, in building this to test your counterweight?\u000a We had problems with the sling and the pouch. Like, at first we made it really long, so like, that didn't really work. It didn't go anywhere, it kind of just fell apart and then the pouch itself, it's kind of like too long. So like it--\u000a So a little engineering before you could quite get one to work, but you did then eventually get one by changing the-- shortening the string and shortening the sling?\u000a Yeah.\u000a All right. So, at that point then, it looks like you had some data and you took several trials. Was there anything, just off the end, any pattern you happened to notice, just as you were taking the data?\u000a We noticed that if the counterweight was too heavy, it would just kind of smack down and then if it was too light it would just of like, it would float and then just kind of fall. So there is an ideal weight to counterweight that would make it ...\u000a Yeah, like, our data, we went from light to heavy and then it went from like not so far to like, really far, to like back again.\u000a What if I wanted to know, not 600 grams or 650, but 625? How could you analyze your data to allow me to interpolate between your data points or to go beyond, if I wanted to know what's going to happen at 775?\u000a  Make a graph or an equation.\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Actually, either of those would work, coming up with an equation or coming up with a graph. To me the graph is a very visual way of doing it. You could determine then whether or not it is a parabola or whether it's some other sort of a curve. All right and that will allow us to look at other data points which I think would be very helpful. So, your job then, between now and Wednesday, is to come up with how you want to analyze this so that you can explain what the results were, from your trebuchet, without sharing all of the numbers, but just by giving the ideas of what it is you found. I think this is actually very fascinating that you found your limit and then it comes back down. I think that's very interesting, the fact that it's consistent. So, help everyone else figure out what would be the ideal conditions according to your data.\u000a  Okay.\u000a All right.\u000a  We can do that.\u000a  Hello!\u000a  Ready to share trebuchet.\u000a Here's our data.\u000a Okay, so first remind me what it was that you were changing or testing.\u000a  We were looking for the angle.\u000a  The angle, okay, and when you were trying to build your trebuchet, what challenges, if any, did you have in trying to test this angle?\u000a Well, when we were doing it, we tried to make the arm in a way that it would be really easily changeable. So it couldn't be like super secure. It had to be-- we ended up doing it with rubber bands and like popsicle sticks, so it was really easy to move.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  It wasn't a super intense trebuchet, but it works.\u000a Yeah, we built the whole thing out of popcicle sticks.\u000a Now, I'm not certain they had popcicle sticks back in the fifth century, but I think . . .\u000a No, like twigs.\u000a  Twigs!\u000a We'll do it with twigs, that's a good idea. Alright, so, then it looks like you took some data at different angles, and you figured out then the range that it went. Was there any pattern or anything that you noticed while you were taking the data? It's okay to say no.\u000a Yeah, we noticed you'd want to start it like farther back, like there'd be really no reason for you to start it at a positive degree angle.\u000a Right.\u000a Because then it's--\u000a Because if it was positive it wouldn't really go anywhere.\u000a Starting with angles that made sense, that you knew would give you enough energy to start it. All right, and then what did you discover about the angles that you did try?\u000a That the farther back you went, the greater length that it would go.\u000a So the very farthest that you took it back did get the longest range.\u000a Yes, that was the negative 45 and that was the largest one.\u000a Now, what limited you, or was there a limit? You stopped at negative 45, could you have gone negative 50 or--\u000a No, that was when we hit the ground because ours was so small. It wasn't like high up to go all the way back.\u000a Ah, okay, all right, You were commenting on being high up. When we get together on Wednesday and we talk about conclusions, we'll also ask about what could we try in the future and that sounds like another something that you could potentially do. Where if you took the same model,\u000a but just lift it up?\u000a Lifted it up, adapted it, see if that would matter. All right that sounds good. So we've got several angles to comment on. If I wanted to make a guess as to what would happen at 35 degrees, or negative 35, or at negative 50, is there some way I could interpolate between data points or extrapolate beyond? Is there some way that you could analyze your data that might allow me to choose a different angle than the ones you actually chose?\u000a Yeah, you could probably think of an average, you wouldn't assume that it would be like 100% accurate, we wouldn't guarantee that, but it would give a good idea.\u000a  All right so if you did some averaging work, if you did some, been thinking of--\u000a Actually, not so much averaging.\u000a You could even set it up like ...\u000a Like side by side, like triangles.\u000a Okay, okay. So, figuring out, maybe the ratios.\u000a Yeah, that's --\u000a That you should get here, using your, when you say your size and dimensions. All right, and that is an analysis that is so legitimate. These are equations you can come up with. You do have the option of doing it visually, that is with a graph. Where you have your angles one direction, and your range the other. Just see what would happen now with just the three data points you have so far. You may find that there isn't enough data to be for certain of what would happen but you're certainly welcome to attempt that in case there is a direct linear relationship or something that's easily recognizable. So you get to choose however you want to analyze your data. When we come together on Wednesday, I will ask you to come up with a conclusion if there is one. Some groups will find that there's no conclusion that the  So that everyone else could know what the results were without looking at actual data numbers. So that's your job for Wednesday, and any other potential questions or things that you might consider for the future if you were to do another test. Also a bonus that we can measure data.\u000a Okay.\u000a All right, thank you, good job. The farthest range.\u000a It was 650 grams for the counterweight.\u000a Six five zero?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Alrighty, so that's good. So we did discover that there was a maximum and then we have lesser returns after that. All right, very good. Fifth group, tell us about your data and your trebuchet.\u000a Okay, our variable was the angle of launch as well.\u000a  Angle, okay, that's good.\u000a And we analyzed it visually, basically, and we found that the larger the angle or the higher it was, the larger the range was.\u000a  The larger the angle equals the larger the range and did you have any limits to that?\u000a Not really, it just kind of continues.\u000a  As long as you continue to increase the angle, you increase the range.\u000a So you mean like the angle of release of the sling? Or the like, how far back the arm goes before you let it go?\u000a  How did you measure your angle?\u000a Oh we measured the distance from the counterweight to our platform and like the farther that we raised it up, the larger the distance was.\u000a  Okay, so the larger the angle to platform.\u000a Like what other angle, could we have used?\u000a  The back arm.\u000a  Okay and this one was how far we pulled it back?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a So isn't that the same angle then?\u000a  Yeah, but we just measured it inside.\u000a  All right. All right so slightly different perspectives we've all found angles on. All right, our sixth group.\u000a We varied the counterweight also.\u000a  Okay, counterweight and how did you choose to analyze your data?\u000a We made a chart and a graph.\u000a  Okay, so you had a chart and then the graph and when you graphed, what did you graph?\u000a We graphed the weight of the counterweight versus the range.\u000a  That's reasonable. The counterweight versus ... range. All right and as you examined your chart and the graph data, what did you come up with as a conclusion?\u000a The more weight we put on, the further the range was.\u000a  Was there an upper limit or not?\u000a Not from the amount of weight that we tested. I mean I would suppose that if you put more weight than the trebuchet could handle, then it would probably would have bad results.\u000a  So that actually gives us a place to go in future. If we were to try to add more to the slab, that might be something kind of interesting to find out, is what is the upper limit and at what point does the equipment fail? That might make a difference with our big trebuchet. We want the biggest one that was successful. Were there any other questions that came to mind or any other things that occurred to you while you were either taking data or analyzing it or building your trebuchet? Josh.\u000a The angle at which the sling was released mattered a lot.\u000a  All right and, in fact, if we were to combine that with your counterweight, we have a couple of variables we might examine at the same time for the same trebuchet. Other questions or things that you thought about that maybe you would've liked to have added to or varied? Steph?\u000a When the sling did release, we could never really tell where it did, and we couldn't really tell if it released it after the object was launched or if it released at the point in time that it's supposed to. So you could never really tell--\u000a

V Dan do you have any background knowledge about density?\u000a Like if someone says, "It's dense out,"\u000a Yeah.\u000a Then it would be kinda wet.\u000a So if something's really, like if there was a dense fog\u000a yeah, it'd be...\u000a So if there was a dense fog, what does that mean to you?\u000a That there's a lot.\u000a There's a lot of it, okay. So you're in San Francisco, and they're like, "Hey, there's a really dense fog." You might expect that there's a lot of fog. Alright, what would be the opposite of a dense fog?\u000a A not dense fog.\u000a No fog or like a really thin fog. Okay, Jackson, do you have any background information?\u000a Well I thought that, isn't it like how close the molecules are together?\u000a How close the what?\u000a The molecules are together.\u000a How closely they are... okay.\u000a Yeah. Like say you're trying to go through a screen door. And like, they aren't really very close together, because they'res holes.\u000a Okay.\u000a And say, you're trying to go through a brick wall.\u000a Okay.\u000a And they're really close together, so it will be harder to go through.\u000a Would you say then, which one would be densest, the brick wall or the screen door?\u000a The brick wall.\u000a The brick wall, and you would say that because?\u000a Because the molecules are closer together.\u000a The molecules are closer together. Okay, anybody else have any ideas about density? Yes ma'am.\u000a Isn't it like how compact something is?\u000a Okay, so give me an example.\u000a Like um don't know how to say this ... kinda going back to the container thing. If we could have luggage, and you fill it up so much, the luggage case is like so filled up, it's so dense.\u000a Okay, so let me take that to the next level. So, let's pretend we're going on vacation.\u000a Okay, we're going on vacation. Raise your hand if you have a place you want to go. Or maybe you're going there next week. I'd be so jealous if you said Hawaii.\u000a Oh yeah.\u000a I could be.\u000a Reese where are you going? Or where would you want to go?\u000a Uuh, Mexico.\u000a You're going to Mexico?\u000a Well not this break, in the in the summer.\u000a In the summer. Alright, so let's build this scenario. He's got one of those big, huge rolling bags that you're gonna put all of your swimsuits in. To go to Mexico, because you don't need other clothes. Flip-flops, swimsuits, and a t-shirt, and that's it.\u000a Okay, so you got your huge luggage... we're gonna pile, all this stuff in there. I'm gonna zip it up. What does that have to do with density? If it's absolutely packed full, what does that mean for the luggage? Yeah.\u000a That the particles are so close together that it's leaving them in...\u000a Is the volume of the luggage changing if it keeps its shape?\u000a Or is, the mass of the luggage changing, because you're adding more stuff to it.\u000a The mass\u000a So you change the mass, because the luggage is staying the same. Okay, your mom says, "You can only bring one swimsuit, "one flip-flop, a pair of flip-flops, and one t-shirt." So I take everything out, now did I change the volume by it, or did I change the mass of the luggage?\u000a The mass.\u000a I just changed the amount of matter, right? So then, the luggage with tons of stuff in it, we said was... what dense or not dense?\u000a Dense\u000a And dense, and so the luggage with a little bit of stuff in it was?\u000a Less dense.\u000a What changed the density of the luggage? What are the other conclusions to what changed the density of the luggage? Peter, what changed the density of the luggage?\u000a Less amount.\u000a Less amount, and in science, which word do we use?\u000a Umm\u000a Volume or mass on that one?\u000a Umm... mass.\u000a Less mass, less stuff, less matter in the luggage. Awesome, we're gonna do this little scenario with a demonstration, so you guys need your clickers. it's gonna be an A or a B type answer on this one. So get your clicker ready, and I'm gonna show you a couple of clips.\u000a Cheese! Ooooh!\u000a Cheese.\u000a Can we eat it? when some people in here don't like it?\u000a I know well, more for me, right.\u000a What?\u000a What?\u000a Alright so, this is cheese. This morning, I went to Safeway and I purchased this cheese that is extremely difficult to open. And I bought certain kinds of cheese\u000a Can I have some?\u000a  Alright. So...\u000a Do we get to eat the cheese?\u000a You do not.\u000a Aww dang it!\u000a Sorry.\u000a Why can't we eat it?\u000a So here's your question\u000a  This is cheese A, okay. Anybody know what kind of cheese that it is?\u000a Grayson, what's cheese A?\u000a Umm... Swiss?\u000a Swiss, what's your observation that led you to the inference that this is Swiss cheese?\u000a That is has the little holes in it.\u000a The little holes in it. Okay, this is regular old...\u000a Cheddar\u000a Raise your hand... Yeah, Dan know what it is?\u000a Cheddar or...\u000a This is a Cheddar cheese.\u000a Okay, So this is cheese A, and this is cheese B. I want to know which cheese is denser. Okay, so with your clicker, I'm gonna put this up on the screen, I want to know, cheese A the Swiss cheese, or cheese B,\u000a Are they supposed to be numbers?\u000a Well, it's gonna be an A or a B. Right so cheese A or cheese B. Alright, and if you need to see the cheese again, walk around. In the meantime, I'll put this question up. I want to know is cheese A the densest? Or is cheese B the densest? Okay, so this is multiple-choice, A or B. There we go, go ahead and click it. And let's see what you guys think about which cheese is the densest.\u000a So the Cheddar is B?\u000a So A is the Swiss, B is the Cheddar.\u000a That doesn't make a lot of sense.\u000a A is the Swiss...\u000a Are we each going to be able to get a piece?\u000a Please don't talk while we're doing this.\u000a My clicker isn't working\u000a It's not working? Which number are you?\u000a 83.\u000a Is it on?\u000a Yeah \u000a Are you pressing the right button, "Send?"\u000a Oh there it goes.\u000a Okay. good\u000a It probably didn't power.\u000a Alright, make sure you clicked in please. And then, let's look at what we think. Okay 92% of you, said that the cheddar was the densest. So, we had another 8%, so two people said that this was the densest. So here's what I want you to do, I want you to pull a partner, who's just the person next to you. So you guys are gonna be partners, you guys are partners, you guys are partners, and you're gonna be a group of three. Partner, partner, partner Mattie and Grayson, and you guys will partner. Sydney and Jackson, and it's kinda gonna go crossways here. So you guys will be a partner. You guys are a partner, and you guys are a partner. Right, you're going to turn to your partner, tell your partner which cheese you thought was the densest, and then I want you to come up with a conclusion, that you could say, "Cheese A was the densest because..." or "Cheese B was the densest because..." So take 30 seconds to talk. \u000a Less mass,\u000a Cheddar\u000a So what is the definition of density, from here to the cheese? Which one is denser, the one with more stuff or less stuff?\u000a More\u000a So which of these has more stuff\u000a Ooh\u000a Nice of you guys, and you're not very nice.  Okay that was 30 seconds. Okay, choose which person in your group is gonna be Swiss cheese, and which person gonna be Cheddar.\u000a Swiss! \u000a Cheddar\u000a Swiss Cheeses, raise your hand please.\u000a Woo!\u000a Swiss cheese? And I need a conclusion from you, so make a statement for me. "We thought "cheese A was the densest because..." so Erica,\u000a We thought cheese B was the densest because it didn't have any holes.\u000a Because it didn't have any holes, okay. Does anybody have a different explanation why they thought cheese B was the densest? Matt.\u000a Well, because cheese A had holes, the holes don't take in the part of the, technical isn't part of the cheese.\u000a Okay\u000a So...\u000a So the inside of the holes, what are the holes actually made up of?\u000a Air.\u000a So there's air in there, but it's not part of the cheese. So then, what's true about the Swiss cheese then Reily?\u000a It has the less cheese.\u000a Less cheese, compared to its what?\u000a Compared to has all of it.\u000a So it's all cheese and this is part cheese. What can we say now about their volumes?\u000a Umm, they're pretty much the same.\u000a Okay, so the volume is the same. Jackson, what can we say about the mass of the Swiss compared to the mass of this guy?\u000a The Swiss has less mass than the Cheddar cheese.\u000a So the Swiss has less mass then the Cheddar. But they have the same volume, can we figure out then which one's the densest? Which one's the densest? \u000a What's both, alright. You had a chance to talk about it, let's vote again. Do you think cheese A is the densest or cheese B is the densest? After our little discussion. Cheese A or cheese B. A is the Swiss, B is the Cheddar.\u000a So we want to know who's more dense\u000a More dense yep, Which one is more dense. More dense. Is A more dense or is B more dense? Let's see if we get an agreement on our inference here about which one's denser. Look at that, we were able to change two people's minds just through discussion. That's pretty awesome.\u000a I thought it would be eight people.\u000a Well we went all the way to 100% here. So that's good. That means that everybody agreed, at least in terms of the cheese. So, as a demonstration...\u000a What!\u000a Well I need a snack, this is really hard work being a teacher.\u000a It's hard to be a student.\u000a That's true. Okay, ready for demo number two?\u000a Yeah\u000a So cheese number one, number two, first we need to talk about, what sinking, floating, and suspending means.\u000a I know it\u000a So in order to talk about this, I have these fun objects. I don't know, has anybody stayed up late enough to see David Letterman?\u000a Yes!\u000a Oh gosh, I lost an animal.  has anybody on David Letterman ever seen the game show he plays called, "Will it float?"\u000a Yeah, I've seen it happen.\u000a Have you Wyatt? What does he do? Do you know what he does?\u000a Well I saw it a while ago, so I don't relaly remember.\u000a So you're not really sure? Anybody wanna guess what he does on the show?\u000a He throws stuff in water.\u000a He takes some stuff, then he puts it in water to sees if it floats or not.\u000a That's pretty much the gist of the game show. So I have, for your viewing pleasure, recreated a game show. So I have objects, we're gonna play a game called, "Will it float?" And the first object, you're going to predict this through the clicker. Is I wanna know, if our little dolphin friend, is it going to float... okay sink... or the third option which is tricky, you might not know this word, suspend. And suspends means hang out kinda in the middle of the water. So you have three options, alright. We're gonna vote on this with the clickers. Do you have a question before we do that?\u000a When you put it to the test, can I move forward?\u000a Absolutely, so if you can't see, you can either stand up or you can squeeze up into an aisle, yeah absolutely. Yes sir.\u000a Which one is it, A, B , or C?\u000a Oh I'm gonna tell you right now, okay. So we're gonna see if the dolphin floats, sinks, or suspends. And if you can't see when I do it, we'll count and you can stand up and watch. So A is gonna be sink, so do you think it's gonna sink. B, answer B will be float. C will be suspend, Okay, so sink, float, suspend which means hang out in the middle of the water. Okay, so this is an A through C option. Okay, A sink, B float, or C suspend.\u000a Well that was fast.\u000a Yeah, that was really fast. So let's see... everyone...oooo object is going to sink. If it sinks, what will you observe? If it sinks, what will you observe.\u000a How fast.\u000a It falling into the water\u000a Well, he's going to fall into the water one way or another but where will he end up?\u000a On the bottom.\u000a At the bottom of that okay? Some of you, one person said that it's gonna float. Okay, so raise your hand if you're the person who thinks it's gonna float. Okay, thank you for taking a risk, that's okay. You don't know yet right, it's for fun. So if its floating, what will that mean, what will you observe?\u000a That's she right.\u000a When I put this in the water, what will it look like when it's floating?\u000a Like... I don't know\u000a Will it will be sitting on the bottom?\u000a No.\u000a Where will it be located.\u000a Floating on the.\u000a Floating, right on the top, okay. And then we had, oooooh three whole people said it would suspend right in the middle. Raise your hand if you think it's gonna suspend.\u000a Oh yeah!\u000a Okay.  Leia, why do you think it's gonna go right in the middle.\u000a I think it's too light for it to totally sink, and I think it's took heavy for it to float, so thought it would be right in the middle.\u000a Okay, so you're making the hypothesis it has something to do with its weight. Okay, alright so that's one idea. Too light to stay at the top. But too heavy would go to the bottom. Is that what you said? Okay, yes.\u000a So does suspend mean it stays in the middle.\u000a Yeah, suspend means it literally hangs out right here.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, that's not true.\u000a Okay, are you guys ready?\u000a Yes.\u000a So stand up if you need to be able to see. Here's the game show, there's a little song that goes with it like, \u266b Will it float, will it float \u266b Okay, there's my game show, you ready? Alright it's very suspenseful. Can you see?\u000a Okay, here it goes. \u000a Yes!\u000a Aww yeah! \u000a So, it sank. So go back and have a seat please. Now raise your hand if you have any explanation for me why that sank. It did sink, oh no! We've all been down to the bottom of the pool. Why do you think it sank?\u000a I thought it wasn't flat enough, or didn't have enough space enough to float up.\u000a So now we've got two different ideas about sinking and foating. So Leia brought up the idea of heaviness, you brought up the idea of surface area. See if I were to put something that has a bigger surface area, is it gonna float?\u000a No\u000a Yes\u000a Maybe, did you tell me that if it had bigger surface on top of the water. Okay, should we try this?\u000a Yeah!\u000a It's gonna sink\u000a Oooh\u000a Okay, so maybe\u000a Aaaaw\u000a It got swamped. Now it floated for a little while right? So maybe the shape does have something to do with it, and maybe weight has something to do with it. Or what it's made out of might have something to do with it. So we have all kinds of ideas now about sinking and floating. Yes sir,\u000a Is it because it's denser than water?\u000a So here's another idea, it has something to do with the density of the object.\u000a It's denser than water.\u000a So here's a tough question, so think about this one. What is the difference between how dense something is, and how heavy something is? If Leia talked about heaviness, now we've got density, and now we've got shape, and what it's made of and all these different things so. I just want to know this one thing. What's the difference between the weight of an object and the density of an object. This is a really hard question, take a second. I want you to rotate back to your partner, talk to them about what you think the difference between density and weight is. \u000a Okay, when we talked about number of particles, it's later than mass.\u000a Mass.\u000a Mass, so the relationship between mass compared to the object. Okay. Okay who spoke last time, 'cause I need a cheddar. \u000a Oh yeah\u000a A cheddar who's willing to talk. Emily, what did you guys come up with?\u000a So, density is like how much mass or how many particles are in the object. And weight is how much gravity is pulling down.\u000a Okay.  So would that mean that something...\u000a,  That's heavier automatically sink. Hang on one sec. And then, we'll try to work through this one. If something is heavier than something else, will it automatically sink? Are ships heavy? Do ships sink? Occasionally, right? Especially if you're on that cruise ship, like last week, did you hear about that?\u000a  It depends on the--\u000a  Okay, now we're talking about depends what it's in. So, now we've got all these different ideas working. Holy cow. Yes, ma'am, anything else to add?\u000a I was gonna say, I don't know why, I'm just gonna hook on this whole list of things, but, like, a tin can will float if it's empty, because of the air that's stuck inside of it holds the object up. So, if that was hollow, I'm guessing that it would most likely float. So, the ships are hollow in the bottom, the air that keeps it up, but the bottom, how part of the ship goes in water is because part of it isn't hollow. That part sinks, but the air in the boat will keep it up and that's how things float.\u000a

V Think out loud, what are we doing?\u000a OK, you know the area of the square is 196 so you want to \u000a How do we do that?\u000a Take 196, divide it by four. \u000a Hold on, let me hear from somebody that I haven't heard from.\u000a Need to find the square root of 196.\u000a OK, why are we taking the square root instead of dividing by four?\u000a Because all sides are equal?\u000a Well, if all sides were equal, that's why we would divide by four. \u000a Because to find the area of the square you have to square it.\u000a So the opposite of squaring is square root.\u000a So, we would divide by four if we were given the... perimeter. If we were given the perimeter of the square we would divide by four. But we were given the area, so we need to square root.\u000a  14.\u000a OK, so the side lengths are 14.\u000a Multiply times 4.\u000a It's 56.\u000a Anybody see a problem with this?  OK, so this side is on the inside of the figure. So it doesn't count, so instead of doing 14 times 4,\u000a  We do 14 times 3. \u000a How do we find the perimeter of a semi-circle? \u000a 2 pi R divided by 2 .\u000a 2 pi R divided by 2? \u000a How do you find the perimeter of a semi-circle?\u000a 2 pi R divided by 2.\u000a So the radius, that means 7, 7 is 14. 2 times pi times 7. So that should be 2 times 3.14...  So the whole thing is 53.38. \u000a So then, 2 pi R divided by 2?\u000a I got 2 times pi times 7 divided by two cause the radius is only 7 cause that line was supposed to be 14. So 14 divided by 2 is 7. \u000a Here, Skye, can you take this? Thank you. Put the final answer on there and then quick to the next problem. \u000a C squared.\u000a OK, all of the line segments in the diagram of the bathroom floor shown below are either vertical or horizontal. How many one inch square tiles would it take to cover the figure? \u000a Don't you got to work it into two rectangles?\u000a I think it'd be easier of you did it the long way. \u000a Does it matter which way you split it?  Either way you're going to have to split something, right?  You can determine either of the missing sides.\u000a In order to find the area of a rectangle you must apply . 7 times 6 is 42.\u000a Where is...I don't see a 7 in my problem.  OK, but what does 7 represent? I don't see a 7, what is...?\u000a It represents the length of this.\u000a What length?\u000a From the line on down to 6.\u000a OK. Could you label that with a 7? Cause I still don't see 7. \u000a It said, how many one inch squares .\u000a OK, so you want to multiply what by 12?\u000a 87.\u000a 87 times 12?\u000a  Why?\u000a But you made the 12 into a 7.\u000a OK, so you want to do\u000a Where are you all getting 12 from?\u000a A foot is 12 inches.\u000a There's one inch, not twelve.\u000a Oh, because I found the 87 feet squared. I found the area of it, but then you've got to find how many 1 inch, so you multiply it times 12 because there's 12 inches in a foot.\u000a So what are we multiplying with?\u000a  12.\u000a So we're doing 87 times 12? \u000a Shouldn't you divide though?\u000a Try dividing. What do you get when you divide? \u000a Say that again.\u000a In one square foot, there are 144 inches. Instead of going by 12 which I said originally, shouldn't we be doing it by 144? Since one square foot is how many inches it is?\u000a But I've got 87 square foot.\u000a But I'm saying in each foot, there's 144 inches. So instead of 12, there are 144 square inches. So instead of multiplying by now that I think about it, we should multiply it by 144. \u000a OK, let me ask you guys this: what if we converted all of the feet to inches before we found our area?\u000a Could we do it that way?\u000a  Yeah. OK, let's try it that way. What would 9 be in inches? 9 feet in inches?\u000a  108.\u000a 108? What would 5 be in inches? 7 in inches, 7 feet?\u000a 84.\u000a 84, thank you Kashmir. And 6?\u000a 72.\u000a 72, thank you Sierra. OK, we know what all our units are in inches. Now when we find the area, we're going to be finding square inches. Somebody want to take over from here? Skye, do you mind if you continue writing?\u000a Uhm yeah. No, I don't mind.\u000a Thank you. You can erase all of it. My eraser got stolen.\u000a So, do we do this the same way but multiply the length and the width, right?\u000a Yeah. \u000a It's what?\u000a 6,480. \u000a It's multiplying.\u000a But that's wrong though. Don't you still have to subtract... I mean, like 84 minus 60 because they're part of the...\u000a No, we didn't convert the 12. We converted the 7.\u000a Oh, OK.\u000a So it's still already changed. Good question though.  What's the total?\u000a 12,528. I just checked it originally with the 87 times 144 and that was correct. You are supposed to multiply by 144.\u000a Good job.\u000a What did you say it was?\u000a 12,528.\u000a How'd you get that? \u000a OK. Next problem. No? You have a question? Yes. \u000a When you get 1000? When did you have 1,044?  Oh, and then you multiply by 12 again. Because guess what 12 times 12 is.\u000a  144.\u000a So that's what you're doing. You're multiplying by into 12 and 12, right? \u000a They way you get 15 from when the outside is 10 before the 15.....\u000a From the very, very top to the very bottom.\u000a Thank you, because now we know that that's 1 inch.\u000a Can't you break it up?\u000a Now that we know the basic triangle in the back.\u000a That means you're breaking it up into... a triangle and a square?\u000a Yes. The square on the bottom.\u000a I'm sorry, Jacob? The base of what?\u000a The base of the triangle in the back. \u000a But what's the base?\u000a 5.\u000a The height is 5 and the base is 15. \u000a Well yeah, but I was asking Jacob what the base of the triangle was. Can you explain why the base of the triangle is 18?\u000a Because the width of the rectangle is 10 and I have to add the sides of the triangle.\u000a

V What I need you to do is, you're going to be looking at both sets of data, the one from October in the morning, and the one from last week in the afternoon. So I want you to work with your shoulder partners, okay? And the first thing I want you to look at, this table you can do all three. Isabella, you can come sit right here. You're gonna work with your shoulder partners and I'm just gonna take a second, and I want you to see what is common, what is in common, how is the data aligned? Okay? So I want you to work with your shoulder partners, want you to talk about what is in common with both days of data.  Okay, where are you all standing? What is the same between those two days?  You're looking from this day to this day, overall, what is the -- \u000a The heat that was trapped inside, the heat that was trapped inside got trapped because the black it was on, and the black soaks in the heat, so when the black soaks in the heat into the covers, it traps it into.\u000a Okay, y'all figured out about the black, look at your other. You have three other kind of solar water heaters, look there, see what other types you can find.  What did y'all find out? The black cover covers it.\u000a Okay.\u000a The black cover, it's highest on both sheets.\u000a On both sheets? And what did you say?\u000a White is the lowest and white, uncovered is -- Whites are lower than blacks, and white uncovered is the lowest.\u000a Okay, okay.  Okay, everyone find some similarities?  Okay, if you can hear me clap once.  If you can hear me, clap twice.  Okay, just one thing. Don't tell me all the things that you have found the same. Table four, what did you find that was the same in those sets of data, Elijah?\u000a Only one went down.\u000a Okay, which one went down?\u000a White uncovered.\u000a Okay, so you saw that white uncovered went down. What's another scientific word for going down, everybody?\u000a Decrease.\u000a Okay, so white under decrease in both, okay. What else did you find, Alex?\u000a That the rankings were the same for each one.\u000a Okay, and when you're talking about the rankings, what are you meaning?\u000a Like, white uncover had decreased the most.\u000a Uh huh.\u000a Um, white covered was, was really toward the middle.\u000a Uh huh.\u000a Black uncovered was also, was the next one, and black covered was the last one. In order from the heat.\u000a Okay, does everyone agree?\u000a Yes.\u000a You all see the same thing? Now, what does it mean that black covered had more of a change than white uncovered? What does that mean, Justin?\u000a That black absorbed more heat.\u000a Okay, that black maybe absorbed the most. And what did the white do? Everybody?\u000a It reflected.\u000a It reflected, or Anthony, what were you gonna say?\u000a Absorbed the least.\u000a Absorbed the least, because it was reflecting. Now, okay, that was the easy part. Now, I want you to look at your graphs, and I want you to try to figure out things that are different, okay? Things that are different, this is a little tricky, okay. So you work with your partner, try to figure out the things that are different, okay?  \u000a Okay, and how does that relate to the results? Look at these results, and how are these results different? \u000a Okay and so you have a wider range, than you do the width, okay.  So what were you saying now?\u000a That, I think that the, they are so seperated out the first time we did it, than last week.\u000a Okay, girls, what do y'all think?\u000a I think here, it's like, up.\u000a Now think about why it would be a lot closer --\u000a Ooh. \u000a Okay, okay well let's take, he said hotter, the morning, what was our temperature?\u000a 24.\u000a 24? And the afternoon, what is? So think about what y'all talking about.  Okay, y'all ready to report out? Okay, if you can hear me clap once.  If you can hear me clap twice.  Okay, different. Give me one thing that was different, Stephanie?\u000a They all got different angles.\u000a Okay, the lines are different angles, you're right. What else? Chloe?\u000a At 10:30 A.M., all of them had, all of temperatures were higher, as well as to the 2:30 P.M.\u000a Higher temps in morning, okay. Um, what else, Kristin, can you think of something else? What do you think, Nick?\u000a There's different air temperature.\u000a Okay, there's a different air temperature. Okay, what else? Just looking at the overall graph, Justin? Just looking at just the picture of the graph, how does the picture look different from the morning to the afternoon?\u000a All of the temperatures went, got decreased.\u000a In the?\u000a In the um, at 2:30.\u000a Okay, and when you say decrease, which graph looked like this? The morning or the afternoon?\u000a The morning.\u000a The morning, which one looked like this?\u000a The afternoon.\u000a Okay, so overall, the graphs look a little different from the morning to the afternoon. Now, why do you think that could be? Why do you think that could be, Kristen?\u000a Because it's like, on the side .\u000a Oh okay, here's our school, okay? This is where we did our experiment. And Kristen's saying that the morning time the sun's here, okay. Where was the sun in the afternoon, Anthony?\u000a It was like barely...\u000a Okay, okay, Semijah.\u000a It was in the clouds.\u000a Okay, it was, sometimes it was going behind the clouds. Where was it, Alex, where was it in the sky? You don't remember?\u000a Behind the school.\u000a Okay, behind the school. So this was our morning experiment, and this was our afternoon experiment. Okay, and did we get different kinds of data? Because what was truly pretty much the same? Between both days, besides the sun, what was the air temperature in the morning? \u000a 25.\u000a 25. Okay, so our air temperature stayed the same, but the thing that was different was what?\u000a Where the sun was.\u000a Where the sun was, okay. So thinking about that, we are going to try to get a solar water heater installed at the school, okay, a solar water heater installed at the school, so what other, do y'all know, a solar water heater, a hot water heater in your house, okay. When you get in the shower or get in the bath and you have warm water, how do you think that water's heated? Does anyone know? Peyton?\u000a You have the water in your, well you have a water heater in your garage or um --\u000a Okay, it's in your garage, but what's heating that water?\u000a The sun?\u000a No.\u000a

V These colors.\u000a What color is this? Yellow, oh my gosh, did you find a lot of leaves that match this color? No? You forgot to do it? Well let's do it right now. Alright, go ahead and put it there. What other ones are yellow? Mmm. That's a yellow one. Is that yellow? Okay, put it right there. Let's see. If we put these two together, do they match in color?\u000a no.\u000a No, so you might not want to put that one in. \u000a Okay, wow. So put it here, you've already given it a check. So now, what I want you to do, by looking at the sheet, I want you to sort by size. What does size mean?\u000a If something is bigger.\u000a If something is bigger or smaller. Now which measurement, which size are you going to sort by? Big or little?\u000a Big.\u000a Okay, so all your big leaves, put them in the middle. Okay. \u000a You decide how you want to sort them. So if you want to use both baggies, that's okay. If you want to just use one, that's okay, too. Okay, that's okay, that's okay, too.\u000a I noticed that you haven't started sorting yet. So which one do you want to sort by? Or do you want to make up your own?\u000a I like to do this.\u000a Yeah, color.\u000a Color? Okay, so ok, what color are you going to choose?\u000a I'm gonna choose brown. Jennifer is that ok? You have to ask your partner. Sort by brown. So put all the leaves that match, the brown, in your work space. Ok, let's see what's going on over here. Ok, well let me see this. Let me see that, please. Ok we are going to work with partners. I know sometimes it can be hard to work with partners, because you're trying to make a choice and maybe one person wants to do one thing, and maybe one person wants to do another so we're gonna work together to figure this out. Well, let's get working.\u000aShe's laughing. How do you want to sort your leaves now. Let's get our workspace in the middle. I notice you already sorted by color, so now how do you want to sort? By shape? Ask your partner if that's ok. Ask your partner if that's ok. Ok, is this the shape you want to sort by? Oh, this is pretty tricky. See if you have any more leaves that match this shape. How can you describe this shape? How can you describe that shape? So you're going to look for ones that have little points? So you're actually sorting by points. Yes, am I hearing that right? So look at your leaves, and look for ones that have teeny tiny points. Look at your leaves, so look at your leaves here. Ones that have teeny, tiny points. It has points, its very tiny. Does it have points? No, no side points? Yes, does it have some side points? Do you think that belongs here? Oh, really! I loved how you used your magnifying glass to find those little details. Keep on looking through yours, Jennifer because I have a feeling that you are going to find some more. Take a look at these points and take a look at these points. You're sorting by points, right? Are those little points or big points? Little or big? Little? Are they little like this? Are you sure? So you think this belongs here? Okay.  Don't worry about your name for right now. I've noticed that you've sorted by every way. Now, are you ready for the challenge? Can you make up your own way to sort? Something that we didn't talk about on Friday? Oh, I bet you could. Yeah, well let's think a little bit more. Now I want you to look very very closely at these leaves. What's something that's the same about some of them? That's the question that you should be asking yourself. What's the same about some of these leaves?\u000a They have dots.\u000a Really, they have dots? \u000a Remember we had colors up here. Andrew just said something. Some of these had dots. Do you see dots on some of your leaves? Yes, do you think that's a good way to sort? So wow, see I thought you said you couldn't figure out another way. So, I want you to put all of the leaves with dots on your workspace.  Okay, how are we sorting here?  That's okay. The way you're doing it is perfect. All you need to shoot for is to keep count of what you've done so far. So let me come to you. I've noticed that you had sorted by color so far. Which one is next, which one would you like to do next? Okay, which one do you want to do? It's up to you. Do you want to sort by big leaves? Is that okay, Monica? Okay, so look at your leaves, and sort by size. Now find all of your leaves that are big. Uh oh, does this one belong there? Does this one belong there? Okay, wow. Amazing. I like how you're really looking at your leaves. Absolutely, that one's very big, nice job.   I really love how children stopped working. They put their hands up. Friends, can I share something that I noticed? Is that okay? When I was walking around, I noticed children using their eyes and sometimes their hands to explore their leaves. Some of you figured out new ways to sort your leaves. And I can't wait for those kids to share their ways. Some of you went ahead and you looked at what we talked about on Friday. Which was also a really great way to use a resource in our room to help us sort. I just want to remind everybody that your job right now is not to touch your leaves. Your job right now is not to touch your leaves. Your leaves are down. Because it's important for scientists to stop what they're doing and share what they have noticed. Let's take a peek. This is a graph, does anybody recognize this graph? Does it look like something we already do? What is it, raise your hand if you want to share. It kind of looks like you use something, it's something we do every, almost every day. Brian?\u000a  Um, the calendar.\u000a  Yes! And what in our calendar, sweetheart, looks like that?\u000a The weather.\u000a  Oh, I love how you're thinking. Absolutely right, our weather calendar looks like this. Today, friends, we're going to share how you sorted. And then, I'm going to go ahead, I'm going to color in boxes. and then at the end we're gonna see. What was the most popular way to sort? What was maybe not the most popular way, and if anyone had a different way to sort. Okay? So, just give me a thumbs up if you sorted by size. Look at your sheet, look at your sheet. And give me a thumbs up if you sorted by size today. Let's see. And actually, I'm only going to ask one partner to put their thumb up. Because I'm only counting partners. So, one group, two groups, three groups, four groups, five groups, six, seven, eight groups, nine groups, ten groups, eleven groups, twelve groups. Uh oh. Do I have enough spaces?\u000a  No.\u000a Oh my gosh, I'll have to add them. Eleven, twelve, so there were twelve groups\u000a  There's thirteen.\u000a that wanted, that sorted by this kind.\u000a  Mrs , you forgot mine. Okay, anybody sort by shape today? Anybody sort by shape today? Okay, keep your thumbs up. One, two, okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Wow, ten groups sorted by shape.\u000a  Mrs  you keep forgetting mine. Mrs  you keep forgetting mine. Okay friends, before we continue going on with that, did you sort by another way today? Did you sort by another way, that wasn't something we talked about on Friday? Emma, did you sort by a different way today? Oh sorry, you're two. Joel, and Emma, I'll come to you. \u000a What's another way you sorted?  Okay, did someone sort by a completely different way that's not on your chart? Andrew?\u000a Dots.\u000a Dots, did anybody sort by dots today? Yeah, okay. What's another way you sorted your leaves? Catherine? Counting the points. Okay, now that was a way that we sorted on our sheet, but that's okay. How's it different?  So you were looking for nine points, okay? So friends there's so many different ways you can sort, and I just want you to put your hands down.. Because there's so many different ways you can sort, and there's many more ways than just what we practiced today. As scientists and mathematicians, we're gonna continue sorting and looking for similarities, things that are the same things, and things that are different. Give yourself a pat on the back. Thank you so much, friends, for doing your best job today.\u000a

V Today I'm going to introduce to you our new project, and it's based on the concept of surrealism. When you look at this word, you should recognize a smaller word within it. Does anyone recognize the smaller word?\u000a Real.\u000a Real, that's right. The word "real." And we know real is the way things really look when we see them, or the way they appear. But the word "sur" transforms that word. And because this is a French word, "sur" means "beyond." So now what the word "surrealism" implies is beyond reality, or the way things really appear. So what does that look like? It looks very dreamlike. It doesn't necessarily make sense. A lot of different things go on in surrealism, and I'm going to show you a few examples right now. These are the three characteristics that we're going to focus on. The first characteristic is out of place objects. If you look at this example up here, what's out of place in this picture? Can anyone tell me? Trevor?\u000a The guy's face.\u000a What's over his face, just floating there? Can anyone tell? You're up close, Matthew. You see what that is?\u000a An apple.\u000a It's a green apple, okay? And that is an out of place object. Definitely surreal. These are examples of surrealism. This example right here. What's in here, Jordan?\u000a Train.\u000a There's a train coming out of a fireplace. Okay, again, an out of place object. These are two examples of one of those characteristics of out of place objects. Another characteristic that you see are unreal scenes. Scenes that do not make sense. They're beyond real. What's going on in this scene? Kurt?\u000a There's, like, giant butterflies.\u000a Yeah. The butterflies grew. They're huge. Now they're like the props on the windmills. What's going on in this? Can anyone tell? What makes that surreal? John?\u000a Like, huge makeup.\u000a Yeah, the si-, again, the size of such little things grew tremendously, and they're filling up the room. Also, the interior of the room is now looking like the sky. So what made these unreal is the artist changed something that was small and made it really, really big. The last characteristic that we see in surrealism is... there it is. Normal objects acting abnormally. So in these examples I'll go through real quickly. Do you see these clocks? They're not acting normally. These clocks are melting, they're dripping, they're stretching, they're falling down. You can see that. In this one, the artist drew a person looking into the mirror, but does he see his reflection?\u000a No.\u000a No. The mirror's not operating normally. It's surreal. It's beyond real. What it's doing is it's showing the back of his head. And again, in this one, it's kind of hard to tell, but there are three swans, and the reflection is of three elephants. So the reflection in the water is not acting normally. These are three characteristics of surrealism, all right? So why surrealism? Why this style of art? Does anyone have any guesses of why anyone, or why these artists created something like this? Yeah?\u000a Because it's like a modern form of art.\u000a Okay, yeah. That's actually a very good definition. Cara?\u000a Maybe to make it look interesting.\u000a Okay, good.\u000a To make it look funny.\u000a Okay, good. Guys, those are all excellent, excellent answers. Here is another thing that went into surrealism. Like lots of art, it's influenced by what's going on around it or what happened before it. So these three boxes represent three other styles of art that influenced the ideas of surrealism. And the first style of art is known as Dada art. This type of art is where the artist took things, and they tried to make something that wasn't considered art. They took random objects, like a bicycle wheel and the stool, and put it together and said, "Okay, this is not art." And that was an example of the style. They also took a famous painting like the Mona Lisa, scribbled mustache and a beard. There it is. That's not art. And that was really the whole idea of Dada. It was like anti-art. Another thing that influenced surrealism was symbolism. Symbolism was a style of art in which the artist tried to depict an idea of something. And in this example, it's the idea of death. There's this dark angel depicted over this man, who's already halfway down in the ground. All this white snow that symbolizes life around him. And it was just the idea of what that might look like using symbols. And that's what that one depicts. The other example, or another influence of surrealism, is metaphysical painting. This one's very, very hard to understand, and that's what the idea was with the style. It was to kind of paint an unreal or illogical situation. Basically one in which you do not know what you're looking at. You don't know what the objects are. You might know something, but you don't know why it's there or what part of it it is. And it's very, very illogical and doesn't make sense. These three styles of art in the boxes influenced surrealism. So when you look at these three styles of art, you can kind of see what they led to. They led to this style of art, which is known as surrealism. So now... where to start. Here's what's going on today. Today, you are going to start with... and you can open your folders up, and you'll see this slide. What we're going to do is we're going to start drawing today. We are going to start by making a connection, all right? And if you look at this example up here on the board, or, and you can look at your slides, too. What we're going to do... you can just take your stuff off, Leann, leave it back there, and then join your table, okay? What we're going to do is I want you to come up with something that means something to you, and that's like your theme to start with. Maybe it's a hobby, an activity, a memory, anything that's meaningful to you, that's your starting point. Then what we have to do is we have to give it an element of surprise. So these are our options that I just discussed. Those are the characteristics. Do you want to move it around, change the location of it? Do you want to make the sizes different and create an unreal scene? Or do you want to make objects in it doing something that they shouldn't be doing? Let me give you an example. Lily, what's your favorite food?\u000a Strawberries.\u000a Strawberries. What's your favorite holiday, Joe?\u000a Christmas.\u000a Jacob, what's your favorite animal?\u000a A dog.\u000a Okay. So this is my surrealist example to you. You have a Christmas tree, but instead of a Christmas tree, you have a big strawberry standing up with decorations on it, and then you have dogs putting those decorations on it. So that's kind of an example of taking things that are meaningful to you and putting them into a surrealist example. These are some examples that I have that I did. These are some of my drawings. This first one, and sometimes you don't even know where these drawings are coming from. I wanted to take an object and stretch it. I wanted to make it act abnormally. So I chose a spoon. And what I did was I thought, well, a spoon needs to catch something. So this spoon is stretching out trying to catch the raindrops. Why? Because it's really dry wherever it is. You can see all the cracks. So that was kind of like my first idea. The second sketch that I did was I wanted to do something with a tropical type of a setting. An unreal scene in an unreal place. So what I thought was, well, pineapples are tropical. Why not cut open a pineapple, and there is my tropical beach with all the little palm trees, okay? You're probably wondering what we're going to do with these. Today is sketching, but what's going to happen is this is going to turn into a watercolor painting. This is an example of what the painting might look like when it's all done. I chose the pineapple one, all right? So we are going to be doing a watercolor painting, but today we need to kind of come up with ideas of what that painting's going to look like. Up here on the board, I think this is going to help you a lot. This is a bunch of different examples of surrealist paintings, and there's a variety of different things that the artist has done. They might be food, they might be animals, they might be instruments, they might be people, they might be landscapes. There's lots of things to look at. I want you to use this as your primary resource to help you and guide you through your drawings. I'm going to give you paper right now. Use this sheet. Start with making a connection, all right? Start with making a connection, and then look at the different options and ways that you can make it surreal, all right?\u000a How do you draw hands?\u000a Hands? That's... okay, hands. You know what? This is just a sketch. So this is a detail that doesn't... or this is a part that you don't really need to worry about. So tell me what's going on. What makes this surreal?\u000a Um...\u000a That's what I want to know.\u000a Because it's the birthday party in the present.\u000a Okay. So which of these options do you think you're focusing the most on?\u000a This one.\u000a Okay, and why?\u000a Because a present usually doesn't open.\u000a Okay, so the present, so the party is within the present. So the present gets opened up, and then there's a party. Okay. What else can we do to make it, like, maybe a little bit more, like, bam, something going on? That's the only thing I was thinking about, you know? Like, maybe...\u000a Like balloons and...\u000a Yeah, balloons. Like, they're com-, they're flowing out. That'd be really cool. All right, that's good.\u000a What should I, like, do for, like, for, like, the face? The face on a...?\u000a Baseball.\u000a Baseball. And what are we using for the parts of the face?\u000a So this is a baseball bat.\u000a Okay.\u000a And I...\u000a Okay.\u000a These are the baseball bases.\u000a Oh, the bases, okay.\u000a Yeah. And this is , and this is...\u000a Okay. So you're combining, you're combining...\u000a A lot.\u000a ...a lot of different things. So why freckles?\u000a Because, like, I thought putting more into it would make it more interesting.\u000a Okay. You know what I think would make this really more interesting is the background. What's going on around the face?\u000a Um...\u000a Think about it. Think about it. What could we do? Where could this be?\u000a In the sky?\u000a I don't know. So what would represent the sky? What could you draw to represent the sky?\u000a Clouds?\u000a Try that. Maybe draw some clouds. I think, I think that's going to make your picture more interesting. Something like that.\u000a Because, like, someone hit a home run.\u000a Yeah, okay. And maybe some action lines around the ball. You know, like a little--\u000a Yeah.\u000a That looks really good. I like that. I like that one a lot.\u000a A dog eating pizza.\u000a Okay, Brittney. Yeah.\u000a I don't know how to draw horses.\u000a A horse?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Why do you need a horse?\u000a Because I want to draw, like, a horse .\u000a What were you going to do?\u000a Like...\u000a A horse...\u000a A horse with a farm inside of it.\u000a Inside of it. So what do you mean inside of it, though?\u000a Like, in here, do, like, a farm, and cows, and...\u000a Well, here's a suggestion, because I like your idea a lot. Why don't we... we can use this as a resource. Why don't we draw, I'll help you with this, just the back of the horse, okay? So we'll just work, we'll focus on, like, the neck and the back, and then the tail kind of coming down like this, okay? So you see where I'm going with this? Now what I'm thinking is why don't you draw your farm scene on the back? Like, almost that it's, like, kind of been placed on there, like a little miniature scene. Like, so maybe on here, you could draw the silo, the barn, and everything on there. Good? Eyes on me.\u000a One, two, three.\u000a Okay, guys, you're doing a really, really good job with your sketching and everything, and I don't, I want you to keep going. But we do need to stop for a minute. And based on the drawings that I'm seeing, I see some really good examples of surrealism, and you're showing me that you understand it. I bet you that if you saw an example of surrealism with some other styles of art, you could pick out the one that represents surrealism. Take a look up here on the board. I have three Tabasco sauce posters, okay? One, two, three, and four. Show me with your fingers, holding them up in the air, which one of these is an example of surrealism. Think about it for a minute. While you think about it, I'm going to wiggle my mouse so I can... okay. What's an example of, which one is a... Jess. Okay, everyone had four. That's good. Why? Why that one? Why'd you pick that one?\u000a Because, like...\u000a Nope, hold on. I was going to let Jessie answer first. What makes that one surreal? Think about it. Michael, go ahead.\u000a The sides are, like, coming off the bottle.\u000a Okay.\u000a And the pepper's, like, putting out the sauce.\u000a Okay, good. Anything else? Erin?\u000a It's, like, out on this, like, island.\u000a Yeah, definitely, definitely. Like, a lot of things make this one surreal. What does surreal mean again? Who remembers?\u000a Me? It means, like, not, like, like, not real, but, like, in a different form.\u000a Right. Beyond real. Beyond real. Okay? And this is a great example of that. Beyond reality. Okay? Here's what I need you to do now, okay? I have one more... Oh, I might have to re- ...I have one more slide that I want to show you up on the board, and if you open up your folders, you'll see this. You'll see this slide. And I printed it out for you. What I'm going to have you do right now, in the next couple minutes, I'm going to have you switch your drawing with someone at your table. You might have to switch three ways, or four ways, or one way. And I want you to assess the drawing that you get. Now, if you get one that has lots of drawings, just pick one of them, okay? Here's what I want you to do on the sheet. This is easy. First thing. What's the first thing that you notice about the drawing that you just received? Write it down. Maybe you noticed a big basketball. Maybe you notice... whatever it is, write it down. Then I want you to check these little circles. Whichever of these options that you see that that person used, I want you to check them out. Okay, Michael? And then I want you to write. This is the one that everyone stumbles with. They're like, "What does this mean?" All I'm saying is, what do you think that person meant in that drawing? What do you think the meaning is? If you don't know, put a question mark. All right? And then what suggestions do you have for that person? Maybe they, you know, if you did a background, it would look really nice. Or maybe, you know what? Maybe you've got to lose something. You've got way too much going on. I can't tell what it is. So this is not going to take you very long, but it's important because it shows that, shows me that you understand what you're looking at, and it also helps the person get a better drawing, which is going to be used for the painting. So I want you to switch drawings right now. Everyone switch. And I want you to use the sheet, and I want you to fill it out based on the new drawing that you're looking at, okay? So you're going to do this independently, and I'll come around and I'll check with you in a little bit. That's the first thing that you see. Write down the first thing that you see, all right? So, Lily, what's the first thing that you see in your, in this picture?\u000a .\u000a Okay. What do you think it is?\u000a .\u000a Okay. What do you think this is as a whole? Don't say anything, because I know it's yours. But this is good, because this is going to help you to make it better if you need to. So what's the first thing that you know? That you th-, what do you see? Just maybe you recognize it just as water. Anything else?\u000a Maybe a blanket .\u000a Okay. Write that down. Okay, that's a good start. What's the first thing that you saw? Almost everything is crooked. That's a good ob-, that's a really good observation. Because everything is crooked. Good. So what options do you think were used in this? Now, which one did you select?\u000a Normal object acting abnormally.\u000a That's right. It's clearly these objects are acting abnormally. That's good. That was a good, that was another good observation. So you just keep moving through. Did you write down your first reaction?\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a Okay. And... okay. So normal objects acting abnormally.\u000a

V Yeah, the oil. Okay, so we discussed that one. So Maddie is going to write  down about the peanut butter.  What the observation was. At the first observation it was 9  centimetres.  And it has grown. In Joshua's words, it has grown.  Good. And you're gonna do that for all three of them.\u000a Okay, um, The peanut butter, \u000a No, we just did the peanut butter  Oh no, I mean the banana, it's... it's... It's grown like 4 inches taller Its like 1, 1 and a half inch taller.\u000a Its like one and  half inches. \u000a Okay what is that? Look. Its like 9 and a half.\u000a 10 and a half - 9, 10 and 12. That's 1, 2, 3  \u000a We're looking at the bananas, yeah ... wait that's half an inch Alright, so did you get that? Were the Cheetos  recorded? Okay, good. Alright, so now we've got... let's look here. Josh go  ahead and read number 9. Compare and record the results from all three fat  absorb- absorption- observations. Observations Observations, okay, so we're going to look at all three  here we've got our data laid out here. Look at your Cheetos. Um the first time Cheetos was eight and a half inches,  the second time it was 10 and a half inches, and the  last time it was 12. 12 centimeters. So what does that mean? Joseph what do you see when  you see those numbers going like that? Um its like growing because every time you check one its  like  a little bit bigger and it gets a little more inches on  and it gets a little bit more big.  So basically the longer that the Cheetos sat on the  paper towel,  the more fat and oil is absorbed into the paper towel,  right? Okay? So um Josh, if you'll just go ahead and write that down  about the Cheetos.  And Hailey, what did you notice about the next food?  The apples? Um, two times it stayed the same and one time it got  a little bit smaller.\u000a Just got a little bit? \u000a Yeah Okay, it says two are the same and one is just a little  bit different.  And that could have been just, um where is our centimeters?  It could have been just human error where we just sort  of measured a little bit off.  Okay? Um, 'cause if you look at this apple sample here,  there isn't really any coming out of the green  circle, is there?  So nothing was absorbed from the apple. Did you see that? Okay, alright? So if you'll add that to our list  that we've noticed, we observed.  Shemaire you look at those potato chips.  I'm going to leave that one here.  Tell us what the overall pattern was with the potato chips. The potato chips Talk real loud for me. Um ok, the potato chips, they, like, changed each time.  Like, the first time, it was 5, the second time it was  eight and a half and this time it was 7. And what are those that you are talking about?  what units of measure? Centimeters\u000a Centimeters, okay. So we want to make sure we get  centimeters written in on there okay? \u000a uh-huh Alright, so what does that tell you about potato chips? Um, that its not like that fat, it doesn't got that much  grease in it 'cause, pretty much it showed like, it was lower and then it got a little bigger  then it just got a little bigger. Okay, so comparing the three here, what do you notice?  Pretty much that this one has more fat than these two. It looks like with this observation, just this one here  in class today,  and later we're gonna do- we'll look at the food labels of  potato chips and Cheetos. But right now, just on our observations, it does look  like the Cheetos have more fat right now, okay?\u000a But when we start reading, its gonna be potato chips? \u000a Oh that leads us in \u000a  It's gonna be Cheetos! So go ahead, so um let's look at number 10,  read that for us Josh. What can you conclude from the observations and recorded  data?  Which snack has the most, or least amount of fat? So you all will come and discuss that together and then you can answer that question right there.  Put most and least. Fine, okay? I'd say the apples have the least amount of fat.  And the potato chips have the least... ... the apples have the least amount of fat, then the  potato chips second and the Cheetos is last. And why do you think that might be? Why do you  think the banana has expanded the most? Because its... - I don't think its because  of the fat in the bananas and getting in... Talk loud I don't think its because of fat with the bananas that's  getting oil on the paper towel, because bananas are pretty healthy and they don't really  normally have fat in them. Yeah, yeah Okay, so that's your background knowledge. You are aware  of that. What were you gonna say?\u000a It's like, its not fat or oil, its like its just water \u000a Maybe water   absorbed in it... What prediction would you make, if we were to let this sit  over night, to where like, the water would have time to dry up.  What would you predict this paper towel would look like  tomorrow? Let me go with Tray? It would be all wet and soggy.\u000a So you think it would actually be more wet? \u000a Yeah. \u000a Okay, Emily what do you think? Well I would think that the way it is now, that the paper  towels are gonna end up like that  and the bananas would get all... and more disgusting and... Okay, does anybody think that the banana might-  that the wet, watery part might dry up? Maybe I think it would expand a little bit more and then  start drying until the water is out of the banana and then the banana starts to dry out too. Okay, well alright. We'll actually leave that one  out and see, and we'll check on it tomorrow. And see what it's doing. And we'll kind of answer  our own question there, okay? Okay, wait we're not finished,  what do we say about the banana? You have to talk louder though The banana I guess - the banana, like expands  the wetness.  It expands a couple centimeters, like a half a centimeter. Good use of centimeters. I like how you're using  the actual mathematical term there.  The centimeter is good.  Okay while she is writing that, I'm going to let Tray  go ahead and read that next question,  Well, if you can see it.  Maddie, will you let him read that so we can kinda  be thinking while your finishing up there? Um, what can you conclude from the observ-  observation and recorded data?  What snack has the most most and least amount of fat? Well, um, as my opinion, I would think that, the  banana has more fat than the peanut butter and the least amount of fat would be the fudge. Okay, Josh? Well, I would think that the fudge has the least amount,  'cause it has the least amount of absorbed like, grease and fat. But the banana has like  ... all this oil, water and all that, like, sinking into it. Okay, Maddie? I think that the peanut butter has the most  amount of fat because um  like I said earlier, the bananas are more healthy  than the peanut butter and  it's probably just water and this is like oils and  salt and stuff,  making it more greasy and that's probably more  fat absorbing into the paper and  then the fudge hasn't had very much at all so  I would say it has the least amount of fat. I would agree with like most of y'all because the banana  and the peanut butter is like,  has like, a lot of wetness in it. And the fudge  has like, a little bit of wetness.\u000a Like a centimeter \u000a Yeah, about a centimeter. But also the bananas could have the least amount of fat  because they are healthier and that's probably just water. Compare the results to the original group hypothesis.  Our hypothesis is that the potato chips will  have the most fat. \u000a Talk loud Our Hypothesis is that the potato chips will  have the most fat.  Our group decided this after discussing Cheetos  versus potato chips deep fried and  adding salt and Cheetos are made out of cheese so  cheese is made out of milk from cows, which is healthy. Oh, wow, lots of thought went into that. Okay, so read that question again, how do we compare  our original hypothesis to what we've discovered  now in our research?\u000a We were wrong. \u000a Say that again. \u000a We were wrong. Okay, so according to our data, what did you find?  Why do you say we were wrong?\u000a Because, like the Cheetos, they had like  a bunch of fat, grease and stuff. \u000a  Talk louder And the potato chips, they like barely have any. They had some, but it wasn't quite what you were  thinking, right?\u000a What were you gonna say Josh, we're gonna  come right back to you. \u000a  No\u000a Yes Joseph?\u000a She thought it was the Cheetos,  which we thought it was that and afterwards now since  we found out that it was probably the cheese ... \u000a Talk loud\u000a When it gets stuck on you fingers, it's all wet and  oily and everything.  -  Okay\u000a No, she's the one that said cheese was healthy.\u000a Okay well think about it, some cheeses are healthy,  this is more of a dehydrated powdered cheese  added to the Cheetos, right?  Go ahead, Josh, what were you gonna say?\u000a She said that maybe the salt from the potato chips  could've dried up the grease, maybe. \u000a  Okay, Hailey? Pretty much what Josh said. It's the same. Okay, so you just agree with that?  So Josh, maybe  you could all just write down some of what you all discussed. About the change from what our prediction or our  hypothesis was to what we found now? Okay?  And Hailey if you want to go ahead and start some  of our discussion questions. Okay? Based on our discoveries from today,  what snack has less fat? Joseph?\u000a Um apples\u000a Claire? \u000a  Definitely apples.\u000a Josh?  \u000a Apples\u000a Yeah, apples.  When you go home today, what snack would you choose based on the data collected today and why? Joseph? I'd probably do the apples because it pretty much has  no fat which we learned, and  I'd probably want to eat no more Cheetos  since I found out how many fat was in them now. \u000a Never again? \u000a  Never \u000a Oh, you wouldn't live would you? \u000a Very good Hailey, say that again?\u000a  I wouldn't eat Cheetos very often You wouldn't eat Cheetos as much, but in  limited quantities, right?  Okay, very good. Shemaire which snack would  you choose? I'd probably have to say apples too because  they are healthy either way and  I love Granny Smith apples, they're my favorite. Oh good, good, healthy snack eater! I'm going to have to say now since we found out Cheetos,  how much fat it has.  Then we start thinking about how much fat is actually in there,  we probably don't know how much fat is in there. Right. Well we're going to look at those food labels  closer now that we've investigated these and see  which one really does have more fat,  the potato chips or the Cheetos.\u000a

V  Like, learning is supposed to be a privilege, not a burden. It's like... Supposed to be... Like, that's why we're America. We have the choice, you're not supposed to be forced to... do it.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Um, but like, about them picking a random person, they might, they might not just go pick a random person if they have to vote, because, if they have to vote, then they're gonna go see that candidate, candidate's political beliefs are, and what he or she is gonna do for the country.\u000a  Okay. Trevor?\u000a  But, if um... they're not gonna know which one to pick if they're not educated, or, don't know about the person.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  What if they don't know how to read? In their researching. They don't know how to read.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Do you want me to say my question?\u000a  Yeah, go, ask your question.\u000a  Okay, um... If only, like, when we don't have... the law, only 60 percent vote, so, how is that supposed to show what America really wants? How is that supposed to show what president we want, and what choices we wanna do?\u000a  But, if, we do get the other 40 percent that already don't wanna vote, then they would just pick one, and that still wouldn't be the, the will of the big United States.\u000a  And outta the 60 percent votes, you could just make your, uh, votes outta that.\u000a  What do you mean?\u000a  Like, the people that did vote, just, choose a person who did get the most votes.\u000a  But we wanna see what America as a whole really wants, not what a little over half of America wants.\u000a  Um, our founding fathers vote for the right to vote, for, for freedom, and so, I think we should use that wisely.\u000a  Okay, elaborate on that a little bit. Say that one more time.\u000a  Um, if our founding  fathers vote for the right to, or fought for the right to freedom, then, I think we should use that correctly.\u000a  So, you think, that, if the founding fathers looked at this law, they would say, 'this is not what we meant, when we said, you know, we want people to vote for our leaders', they didn't want us to force people, they still wanted it to be a freedom.\u000a  Didn't we like, like, have the law, for, like, trying to get the opinion of the whole population of America? The other 40 percent, it still, wouldn't be like, their decision, because they would just, pick one, they wouldn't really care. So, they're not really getting any difference, by not having the law.\u000a  But we're not forcing  them to do that, we're forcing them to help America.\u000a  So, you're forcing them...\u000a  Okay. Jackson, can you respond to that point?\u000a  Um. Yes, if you, like, if we don't force people to vote, then, maybe the poor, just can't make it there. And if we say, 'oh, you have to vote', then we, then we could like provide them transporation to get to there. Also, if poor people won't vote, that means rich people will vote, and they'll just... vote for the person who they believe is gonna keep them rich, and that they'd not go against that.\u000a  Do you think that that represents the majority of Americans, if only those, wealthy, or, at least, middle to upper class people are voting?\u000a  No.\u000a  No.\u000a  Because if the poor people don't vote, they're already poor, that's already bad enough, and they don't get to voice their opinion, and in a democracy, too. That's just even worse.\u000a  And that's a big segment of people, right? So, you're saying that, really, a lot of these people, maybe it's that it's not that they don't want to vote, it's that they don't have the opportunity, we need to provide some more... public, um, opportunities, like, opportunities like public transportation to allow them to vote, to make it easier. Okay?\u000a  'Cause it's, not only poor and uneducated people, it's just people that really don't care that much, and like, when making those people vote, like kind of what she said, they could... most, a lot of 'em could try and break the law, if you force them to vote. Because they just don't want to and they really don't care, and like, if there's somebody who has... who doesn't care but, they're being forced to vote, and they have a really busy job, and they have a lot going on, they wouldn't have time to research, or anything, and so they could, they would just have to go out there when they did have to vote, they'd just vote for someone, 'cause they never had any time to do any research or look at something about the... people to vote for.\u000a  Okay, let's come back to that point, 'cause I think we still have some questioners, who haven't... asked their question, who's, who's up next? Jaylen?\u000a  Um... you say there are, different ways to... give them their complete and to vote, but, what are those ways?\u000a  What'd she say? \u000a  Well, if you have, things...\u000a  Hold on. Let me, let me make sure they heard what you're saying. Say it again, but say it louder.\u000a  Okay. Um...  I say, it's different ways, to get them to vote, but what are those ways, that you get them to vote?\u000a  Does anybody have a ready response for that?\u000a  I can't hear her.\u000a  She's saying, you guys are saying there are better ways than compulsory voting laws, there's other and better ways, so, what are those ways?\u000a  Like, just because they're poor, doesn't mean they can't know that like, you can like, hang up posters, or like, get someone to hand out flyers or something. It doesn't have to be all electronic.\u000a  I'm not talking about poor people. \u000a  Well, she's saying...\u000a  It could help anybody, really, but...\u000a  Okay. Respond...\u000a  Well, but there are poor people that wanna vote, they don't have a chance to.\u000a  Excuse me? \u000a  Well, hold on, hold on a second. Hold on, hold on, 'cause I, I'm not sure that y'all are understand what her point is. Say your point again.\u000a  Um...\u000a  With some passion.\u000a  With passion? \u000a  'Cause that'll make your point.\u000a  Just scream at her.\u000a  WHAT are different WAYS that  you can get the American people to vote?\u000a  Besides.\u000a  Besides posters, because a poster's not gonna...\u000a  It's compulsory voting.\u000a  And besides these laws, what are some better ways to make people vote?\u000a  Well y'all keep sayin' go and like, pick up people, and providing transportation, well instead of doing that to make them vote, you might as well just do that so that they might have the opportunity to vote rather than having to vote.\u000a  So you don't necessarily have to have these laws, to still provide some public services to encourage people to vote. Okay.\u000a  And like, we all know that we get those like, very long phone calls that are like, vote for this person because, they're gonna do all this stuff, and like, that then, like, someone who gets that phone call could actually think about it, and then like, 'maybe I should vote for that person', and you see the big... billboard thingies that have the big names on it, and all the signs in the yards, and so, that could make you think, 'well, maybe I should go vote, since... all these people are saying we should vote for that person.\u000a  So you, you think they should have an increase in... in publicizing elections, we should, we should have more advertising when elections come up? Okay. Okay, \u000a  Well, if you were to like, have election...  um... that would like, cost a lot of money, to have like a lot of, um... transportation going around. So, um, and it's like, not a lot of people are gonna use that transportation, then why, just like,  so, why not just make them vote, cause, they already have public transportation out there.\u000a  Okay. Let's top on that one, we'll come back to it, because we've got one more question.\u000a  Uh, if we didn't  require people to vote, what would happen if... what would happen if like, nobody voted... decided to vote?\u000a  Say that one more time.\u000a  If we didn't require people to vote, what would happen if like, nobody decided to vote?\u000a  Or a small majority of people.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Well, people have different opinions, like, some people think that we put a voice out into the government, and say what we want, and then, some people think, like, that, we... that every vote counts. And... basically, there's... like, five... three million people in America, and I don't think every single one of them would not vote.\u000a  Okay. Any other responses?\u000a But we already have 60 percent voting. I mean... and, so... we know every, some--people are going to vote. It's just the people who... don't care about politics, and, just, like, when we had the survey, people, a lot of people didn't vote for the midterm election. But, on the other hand, some people did. We're always gonna have a group that doesn't vote, and a group that is voting, and if you make them vote they're not gonna care. Even, as more, as they did when they weren't voting.\u000a  Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and open up the floor, because we've asked all the questions, so, pretty much anybody can answer or ask, but let's try and keep it on the same topic, so, if you are raising your hand, make sure you're responding to what the last person said. Okay? Uh, let's see. Connor.\u000a  Oh, like you said, every vote counts, but like, we need more people to vote so we know that, like, we know the exact number, of like, who is going to be the president, or, in the House of Representatives, or the Senate. So that theres a better chance that they will get elected.\u000a  Okay, so, we need a more accurate portrayal of what people think. We need more people to vote so we really know what Americans think. Okay.\u000a  Well, I agree with Connor, but, going back to what everybody over there is saying, they're all saying, 'oh, they, they won't care, they wont, they wont care or anything and, they wont pay attention to what happens', but, I mean, if we can... make like... some kind of exception for like, special needs people, for the deaf and blind and... then um... also, we can get people to stand out in front of a booth, and once they'll go, get there, you can do a speech about... both candidates, and their ups and downs.\u000a  Okay, so you're saying actually have, people at the voting polls that are kind of breaking down the two sides. Maybe for those people who didn't take the time to research it. Okay.\u000a  Um, one of y'all keep sayin', we keep sayin' that they might not care, but like, in actuality, if you, if someone doesn't care, and you force them to care, not only is that kinda like, convincing, like, brainwashing them, it's also, if you force someone to do something, they're not going to want to anymore. So that wouldn't be helping anything.\u000a  So you're saying it's, it's gonna actually make them more bitter, toward voting, if you force them to do it. Okay.\u000a  And, someone said that it's gonna be for the good of the country, for making them vote, but, if they could choose a bad, a bad person, 'cause, it wouldn't be for the good of the country then.\u000a  Okay, so if you force them to vote, and then they go and vote for a bad person, that's not gonna be helping the country at all. Okay. Jason.\u000a  Um, like, um, you could, um, for those people that can't vote, or um, you could... put the... they could put the polls, the voting polls near... where those people, uh, live, and um, so that, they could like, if they can't drive there in a car, they could just walk there, because it'd only be like, maybe a block down their way.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  You could like, open a public train, like, so they don't have to pay to go as much.\u000a  And then make it free?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  For that day? Okay. Alexandra, what do you think?\u000a  Alright, um, well like, making people vote is gonna make them more interested in like, the country, and then they'll actually care, 'cause like, they're not gonna wanna like, break a law, and so then they're gonna actually care about the country, and so they won't just be choosing a random person, they're gonna actually start caring and, start thinking about who they should choose.\u000a  You really think if, if we force them to vote, then they, they will become more interested in politics and they'll go out and research it. Okay.\u000a  Like, just like, if you make some, make everyone vote, then it's really not gonna change their opinion, they're still gonna have... like, they're still gonna... not really care as much as the person that would go out and vote without being forced. So you're really not getting an accurate... number of what they think they want, because they still... just because you're making them vote doesn't mean they're gonna... necessarily pick the right person.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Um, they're always saying like that, we still have this 40 percent that haven't voted, well, everyone, like even the poor people and the uneducated, well everyone knows that there's a presidential election, or some kind of election going on, you can't, it's like, impossible to not know about it, and so really, it's their choice... that they didn't vote, most of the people who aren't poor but they're like middle class  like, they won't make the choice to vote, if...\u000a  Okay. So you're,\u000a  A lot of people have made the choice to vote.\u000a  So you're saying, the presidential election, everybody knows about it, everybody probably has an opinion because it's all over the place, so, and 40 percent are not, obviously those 40 percent know that they don't wanna go and vote.\u000a  They've chosen not to vote. Most of them have chosen not to vote.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  You know, I have to disagree with you, when you say that if we just tell people to vote, they'll just pick a random person. What I think is that, if people are being told to vote, they'll just go in there and say, 'well, if I'm being told to vote, I just might as well just pick someone good'. You'd think that they would actually try and think about something before they vote, like the term 'look before you leap'.\u000a  So you think, if they have to go to the effort of voting, they're at least gonna think about it. They're at least gonna form an opinion. Okay.\u000a  Um, like, you put, of, um, you  you could like, make the offices, make the person take the day off, and like, sort of give them the day off.\u000a  And that's...\u000a

V Why do they keep getting colder? Why do they keep getting warmer?\u000a They add water to it.\u000a Maybe they add water to it. Okay, what else?\u000a The thermometer?\u000a What about the thermometer?\u000a They could have lights.\u000a Lights, well did they turn off the lights afterwards? Okay, at this point, at that point?\u000a Maybe after they took their first temperature they took out the thermometer.\u000a Maybe they took out the thermometer and that has something to do with it. The thing is, ultimately are we gonna know what they did? Unless I was video taping you during that whole process. There are a couple things I wanna point out here in a second. I think several of the ideas are possibilities. What happens if you put your thermometer into the water initially. What do you need to do? As soon as you put it in there what do you need to do? Do you immediately start taking readings?\u000a Yes.\u000a Everybody agrees? We immediately start taking readings. As soon as we put it down in there, like the first second we start taking readings? We take a thermometer, put it in hot water and immediately start taking readings? \u000a Like, what's the starting point and the next temperature would be whether it increased or decreased from that point.\u000a Okay, so we need a starting point. What were you going to say?\u000a If you put it in there, like if you had it at a certain temperature and you put it in cold water it would still be reading room temperature. It wouldn't change immediately...\u000a Yes, so it goes 22, 21, 19, 18... It's going down \u000a So, what could have been the issue here?\u000a They took it at the very beginning.\u000a Good, good. They just didn't wait long enough. Look at this one. I saw this in one particular group. Because, by the way, you guys realize you were doing some very, very different things, right? As we were doing, and collecting this data there were some major differences. What could have happened? What was going on here? Just the obvious stuff. Observation, what's the difference in the pattern? Yes, Ma'am?\u000a The hot water is like consistent like it's just gonna stay at the current temp.\u000a Hot water stays hot? Right? Cold water is doing what?\u000a Increasing in temperature.\u000a It's increasing in temperature. The room temperature water is doing what?\u000a It stays the same.\u000a With this same group I just happened to catch this. Cold water. Luke warm water. The person was doing this. This is the warm water.\u000a Oh *laughs* body heat.\u000a Keeping it warm.\u000a Insulating it.\u000a What was happening? \u000aTransfer of heat.\u000a We're gonna be doing a lot of labs over the next several weeks. This doesn't seem like a big deal, right? I mean, would you have noticed somebody just sitting there going like this? You've gotta start thinking like scientists, though.  Because that could be a huge deal if we're doing something with temperature, right?  Okay, good. Well, the obvious - or the observation. What's going on with the cold water?\u000a It's increasing.\u000a It's increasing, okay. Luke warm water?\u000a Staying the same. The hot water?\u000a It's getting cold.\u000a It's getting cold. Okay. What's different from the first slide?\u000a Yes?\u000a The hot water went past the room temperature of the cold water.\u000a Did it actually happen to somebody?\u000a Did it actually happen? Yeah. Let's do this first. Let's go back to here, what word would you use to describe what's going on here? What's all this heading towards?\u000a Room temperature.\u000a It's all headed towards room temperature. There's a fancy word that starts with an E.\u000a We may have talked about this last year.\u000a The fancy word - The idea, there's a word I want you to walk away with. The word is?\u000a  Equilibrium.\u000a Okay, how does this show equilibrium? Rebecca, how does this show equilibrium? With the hot water, how does this show equilibrium?\u000a Rebecca.\u000a It's Sierra. It all goes toward the same, it's kind of like the hot is increasing and it's temperature-\u000a The hot is what?\u000a I'm sorry I meant the cold. The cold is increasing in it's temperature and then it's going towards the room temperature.\u000a It's going towards room temperature. The hot is?\u000a Decreasing in temperature and it's going towards the room temperature also.-\u000a Is this what we would expect? All right, so what happened? Because I don't have any idea. What happened here? Yes?\u000a In some places of the room there are places where there is a lot of air coming out? So maybe that one cup was under a lot of air.\u000a We do have some powerful air vents. What do you guys think? Is that-- that's a huge amount. Any other ideas? Yeah?\u000a I think they accidentally read one of the cold cups and marked the temperature  down for a hot cup.\u000a Is it possible there's human error here? And they just... they looked at the wrong thing?\u000a Maybe when they were pouring the water into the cups maybe they accidentally mixed the cold up with the hot.\u000a So there's mixing the water, thermometers--maybe just read them wrong. So you guys think some kind of human error, then? Yes? Yes?\u000a Let's go back to this and let's go to the next step. Kind of like what we've done in the past. I want you to think of this at an atomic level, a molecular level what's happening here. In order to do that, we're gonna play with BBs. I've got enough sets of BBs here, each group is gonna have a set of BBs. All right. So group up a little closer together. Alright, so you two maybe go around... you guys. Here's what I want you to do. Within your group one half have one set  Actually, the two of you can...  Marcus... Good, here's what I want you to do. The BBs will be what?\u000a  Atoms.\u000a Atoms and molecules. Okay, are atoms and molecules just sitting?\u000a No.\u000a When we add energy are they gonna go faster or slower?\u000a  Faster.\u000a When we take away energy they're going to?\u000a  Go slower.\u000a Or, rather than take away, when they release it. I'm gonna give you a couple minutes. I want you to talk within your groups. I want you to be able to do three things. I'm gonna call people up here in a second. I'm gonna stick you on the overhead so everybody can see your BBs. I want you to be able to simulate the top line, the middle line and the bottom line. So, getting cooler, room temperature, staying the same and getting warmer. I also want... kind of a bonus would be to use both how would you show something going into equilibrium? All right, talk to each other real quick. Some are getting cooler. Some are getting hotter. Some are staying the same temperature, and how would you show equilibrium? I'll give you about a minute or two. \u000a All right everybody. Take a look at your BBs. Hands off BBs.  I got a volunteer. What were the BBs again?\u000a  Atoms.\u000a Atoms. And we're trying to show what?\u000a Movement towards equilibrium.\u000a Movement towards equilibrium. What? Energy-- energy and movement how those go together. Energy transfer is kind of a fancy way of saying it. Okay, everyone take a look at the chart. Here's the graph. Show me the top line.  And tell me what you're doing.\u000a Make it faster, because it's hotter. It decreased because it's going down and getting less heat.\u000a Okay, so it's gonna start-- the BBs are going to start going fast and then...\u000a Slowing down.\u000a Slowing down. Could you show us... Yeah, we're in an awkward spot.  Getting warmer, the bottom part of that chart.\u000a At first it goes slower and as it gets warmer the molecules move faster because it's getting warmer.\u000a Thank you. I'm gonna do room temperature. I think room temperature would be this, and it stays the same. Kenny what? Well, it's gotta be moving, right? Room temperature would just be this and I have to do what? \u000a Oh, I probably should have picked the same group. The two of you working together, how could you show us equilibrium? Of going towards equilibrium.\u000a She's going to do cold.\u000a Okay, and you're going to do hot. Okay good now, time out. What did you do? Or were you not done?\u000a I started out fast and she started out slow.\u000a Why did you start out fast?\u000a Because I was hot.\u000a And you were?\u000a Cold.\u000a Cold. And Lauren, what did you do?\u000a \u000a The same speed, which was getting close to equilibrium.\u000a Show us one more time. Good. Who disagrees? Nobody? Good. Thank you. Here we go, keep going. A couple more things real fast. Most of you guys had this going about six, seven, eight, nine... anywhere from six, seven to 15 minutes of data. If we did this for an hour, what would this look like?\u000a They would eventually all be on the same line for a while.\u000a And it would be pretty boring. So this would keep going-- well, what would be the lowest point?\u000a Room temperature.\u000a This would be the highest point? Then this would still continue the same. What's the word?\u000a  Equilibrium.\u000a Here's how all this started. This whole lab that you guys put together and created. It's a demo. Here's how it all started. I asked you a question yesterday-- a couple days ago. Jar, bag with some water in it, scarf, although I told you gloves, and then aluminum foil. We came up, we felt all four of these things. And you made a predic... Well, the question was, "If we put these outside, left them there overnight, you look outside your window--"\u000a

V Guys ready?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Okay number one, start, give your idea. Read the word, give your idea of the definition.\u000a Okay what's your word? "Soldier," okay and okay you're gonna give your idea? What's your idea of soldier?\u000a I think tax is like when you buy something like, the extra, yeah.\u000a One person at a time, it goes in order, so what's your idea?\u000a Like a government, so\u000a Okay you need help. Have you ever seen a soldier before?\u000a Taxes for me are...\u000a Where?\u000a Money or something, I don't know.\u000a And what does a soldier do, do you know? Okay, he fights for freedom, very good. So it's someone who fights for freedom, that's your definition. What's your definition?  Very good, you guys keep going, you're doing great. Let me see how this group is doing over here. Where are you guys at? Have you already given your definition?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay did you already give yours? Did you already give yours? Did you give yours yet? What do you think it is? What's the word?\u000a Patriot.\u000a Very good, patriot, and did you listen to their ideas?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay and you need thinking time? Okay. And remember, you can build on their ideas too. Louder, a little bit louder.\u000a I think it means to... I think it's\u000a You've heard it in a song, that word?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah? So someone was a patriot in a song? What did it mean, in the song, if they were a patriot? How did they feel?\u000a They feel sad?\u000a Sometimes sad, you can feel sad if you're a patriot. On 9/11, when the planes crashed through the buildings, people were sad because they were patriots, they loved their country, right? And they were sad to see that. Can you be happy if you're a patriot too?\u000a Yeah.\u000a When would you be happy if you were a patriot? You're a patriot for the United States, right? Or even for the country your family originally came from. How do you feel about that country if you're a patriot?\u000a Happy.\u000a Happy, and do you not like them or do you love them, that country?\u000a I love them.\u000a You love them, okay, so a patriot is someone that what?\u000a You could be more excited or happy?\u000a Okay and how do you feel in your heart about the country? Do you dislike it or do you like it a lot?\u000a I like it a lot.\u000a Okay, alright. And I didn't hear your ideas but can you guys get together and agree, or do you want to look it up first? Should we look it up, to make sure we have the right idea? Okay everyone let's get into our books and let me make sure you have your papers too. There are your papers too, goodness Miss Bryant got ahead of herself. Just in case you forget the direction, the page is 493 to check, go all the way to your glossary page 493 to check.  Let me see what you guys have, let's see. Okay and where does that money go to, do you guys know?\u000a The government.\u000a Oh, did you look it up to make sure that it was perfect, your definition? Okay let's look it up real quick and make sure because it looks pretty good but let's just make sure. That's my fault because I got busy with table one and didn't give you this paper so on page 493 there you go, 493 it starts but then you have to go in ABC order, right? And let's look it up and make sure you have the right definition. You guys are looking up tax, that's right.\u000a A "T."\u000a "T, T, T," tax, good, like the way you're using your resource, 'cause that was one of the things we said we're gonna do, is use our resource.  Okay, what did you get? Do you know where to read it?  Good, I like the way that you worked together and helped, so, Les, what did you have?\u000a  Taxes for new money\u000a To where, where does that money go?\u000a  The government.\u000a Okay so let's add that. Who started this?\u000a Her.\u000a Me.\u000a Okay so you wanna add that? You guys all agree?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a You feel good? 'Cause it's not just any money for anybody, it's money to the?\u000a  Government.\u000a Okay, so let's add that, go ahead. Good, I like the way you used your resource and checked it. \u000a A patriot is a person who loves and supports\u000a their country.\u000a And that's kinda what you guys said anyway right, you said they love, is that what you guys said 'cause I wasn't here earlier, did you say stuff like that? Oh great. Are all of you patriots? Do you love your country?\u000a Loves and supports their country. \u000a Okay, now what happens? It goes to person\u000a Number two.\u000a Number two, you get to read it and they're gonna repeat the question, right? Okay there you go and here's the directions just in case you forget.\u000a What is it like? Describe it.\u000a Okay, let's repeat.\u000a  What is it like? Describe it.\u000a You guys, did you repeat? Let's repeat.\u000a  What is it like? Describe it.\u000a Okay so before we write, you get to start, so what is it like? Can you describe a patriot?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Okay what is it like?\u000a  It's like\u000a Or who is he like, 'cause they're a person, right?\u000a  Is like someone who will respect their country.\u000a Who's that? Can you think of a person? Oh I'm sorry honey. Can you think of a person? Who's an example? Let's see, describe it, so when you think a patriot, okay they support their country, what else?\u000a  Respect the government.\u000a Very good, those are good words, so you could put that there, but we're not gonna write yet, right? Because we're gonna give everyone a chance. What would you say? What do you think of when you think of patriot and you would describe it if you had to describe it to someone.\u000a Patriot is soldier.\u000a That's a great example. What about you?\u000a Someone respect every city everywhere and respect to everybody to not be...\u000a Very nice.\u000a Can it be also honoring?\u000a I like that vocabulary word, honor, how do you guys feel about honoring? What do you say about respecting? Okay, alright, you get to write first. You write one then it'll go around and each of you can write one in a box, okay, every one of you write something in the box. If you need help, ask your table for help, right? Okay, good. How's it goin'? \u000a If something costs $7.99, it's plus, like, tax.\u000a Plus like, a dollar.\u000a Yeah, a dollar.\u000a Taxes come in like, a dollar or two dollars.\u000a Just put taxes like, extra money.\u000a Great, okay now you. Alright so we said it protects the country, fights, what did you say when you gave ideas?\u000a Fights for his, risks his life for others.\u000a What do you guys think, risks his life for others? Should we include that?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Yeah? Okay, that's good. Good, okay and then you're gonna write one too, right? \u000a  What else makes that "kuh" sound, a "C" and what else?\u000a "K."\u000a You guys agree? Okay let's put it down, a "K." Risks. I like the way you're helping each other, that's great. Alright. Very nice. Okay and you get to put an idea down too, we wanna make sure everyone gets a chance. So put your idea down, you can put it in any of the boxes because there's room, here, here, or here. No that's fine because we're all gonna keep going, yep, so I want you to put your idea that you said earlier here, here, or here for describing the soldier. Do you remember what you said? What'd you say?  Very good, so put that down. \u000a Tax is more money for the government.\u000a You can just look in the book.\u000a Just put tax is extra money for the government.\u000a We already have that.\u000a Oh I know, tax is extra money for the government. Tax is, I-S for extra money for the government. \u000a Okay so has everyone given an example? Okay so whose turn was it to write, your turn? So you write first and make sure everyone gets to write one in.\u000a Tax is extra money for government. Money, money, money. M-O-N-E-\u000a Yes, did you guys give your examples first?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Before you wrote? Okay good. Do your parents pay taxes?\u000a  Yes.\u000a They do. Everyone pays taxes, that could be an example. I have a question. Do your parents pay taxes? Everyone pays taxes, don't they? Do we have to pay taxes when we get gasoline?\u000a Yes.\u000a Yes, do we have to pay taxes when we buy a video game?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Everything.\u000a Yes, everything except for food. Food they don't tax, isn't that nice of them?  Okay and what does the tax go to support?\u000a The government?\u000a The government and the schools, right? And the firemen, the policemen, good, okay so now you have some more. Great conversation, great conversation. \u000a Was Thomas Jefferson a patriot?\u000a Martin Luther King.\u000a Martin Luther King was a patriot, good. Who else was a patriot?\u000a Abraham LIncoln?\u000a Yes, okay let's take turns though, who's turn is it now? Who's a patriot? Someone who loves their country.  Are you a patriot? Could you say "I am a patriot?"\u000a I'm a patriot.\u000a Very good, there's an example. Can you think of someone who's a patriot?\u000a A soldier.\u000a A soldier. Why's a soldier a patriot? Why do you think they love their country so much? What are they willing to risk?\u000a Their heart?\u000a Their heart and their what? They could, what could happen if they got shot?\u000a They die.\u000a Yeah, they're risking their lives, so they really love their country, they're really patriots aren't they? Very good, so you ready to write? Who's turn is it? No that's okay, so whoever's next, so if it's your turn you go. Oh okay, so it's your turn so you get to write an example of a patriot. Try to write in a complete sentence, I bet you can. \u000a You just draw pictures. \u000a

VOkay. But before you check over what  you need to make sure you do? All of it. Get it completed, right?  Okay, awesome. So your goal would be to... Get homework completed. \u000aWonderful! Okay! Excellent! Okay! Now I brought  some extra markers and stuff here because  I know you're a visual learner, that you do a good job remembering things that you figured out on your... learning styles test. So this is for you to do. You can choose any colors to make  it look however you want. Okay? So you've got your goal and then we need to figure  out why is that goal important. So your goal is to Get all homework done. Excellent. And why is that important? Because when  you're in fourth grade you don't get all  your homework done and you on fence and when you get on the fence, I've been there  a couple of times and is not very fun, and for the good achievement you get to go to Hot Wheels. hmm... So if you don't do your homework, You're on a boring fence. Okay! You have to stand  by the fence at recess. And if you do do your homework, you go to Hotshots. Homework Hotshots. And that is... What do you have to do to  qualify for Homework Hotshots? Do all your homework for all the...  Oh! Wow!! So... All your homework  throughout the nine weeks and then you get to go.. get to be a Homework Hotshot, which means you  go to Hot Wheels and enjoy the day skating. Excellent! Okay! So you just brought  up a good point. umm... So this goal is important because not only do you  not want to stand by the fence, and you want to  be a Homework Hero. What's going to happen  if you do your homework? You go to Hot Wheels. You go to Hot Wheels and what do you think... What effect is that  going to have on your report card here? If you're doing all your homework,  what's going to happen to those grades? You get all the grades go up. like the 100 - 200. That's right. Very good. All right. So, go ahead, write that down. Why  you think homework is important. Excellent So this goal is important because  you can always get good grades. and homework is  a way that teachers help the students  reinforce the things that they are learning in class. So that's an excellent  way to get good grades. Okay! So we know our goal  and we know why it's important. So let's think about what kind of rewards we're  going to get for reaching that goal. You get achievement awards. You go in a limo with the principal. And you go out to eat. and Hot Wheels too, right? So those are some long-term goals over the next nine weeks. You get to complete your  homework the next nine weeks. You get to go to Hot Wheels and might even be on  the principal's honor roll to take the limo ride. Pretty cool, huh? Okay! So that's here.  We've got Don't forget one thing, that you get to drink soda while you're going. You do? I didn't know that. I've never been in there. I've never been in the limo, but I heard. Oh, my goodness! Well, that certainly is a nice incentive, something to motivate, huh? Good! So that's kind of  a long-term motivation. We've got to work  hard all these nine weeks to accomplish that, right? Okay! So we've got here. When I meet my  goal for the quarter, Quarter is another way of saying  the nine week time period. you will what? What do you get to do if you do all your homework  over the nine weeks? I will go in a limo. Well, that's for principal's honor roll, which is definitely an option. What's specific for homework? umm... When I meet my goal, for the quarter,  I will go to Hot Wheels. Go to Hot Wheels.  Awesome! Excellent. So the nine weeks sometimes it can feel like long way away, can't it? Okay! Because nine weeks is not easy. They are not easy  to do your homework Because it's a long  time before you go to Hot Wheels and we only  have eighteen weeks in school. So it's easier sometimes to stay motivated  and work towards a goal if you have some incentives that come on  more of a short-term basis. Meaning that instead  of waiting all nine weeks to go to Hot Wheels,  which you will get to do, if you meet your goal. Let's think of something that  we can do maybe, once a week. That would be  a good incentive for you Study. Okay! Well, studying is  part of your homework plan. Let's say that you study and you turn all your... you do all your homework and at the end of the week  when I check in with you, when I check in with Miss. Butler, and I check in with your granny, and I'd say, So how did Annamarie do? Did she  get all her homework done? mm hmm.. And they say- Yes, she did. What do you think might be something that you're willing to work towards here at school that would be  a reward once a week? I will come to you  and I will help you. You'd like to help me?  All right. So could we agree that let's say, I check in on Fridays with your teacher and your granny and you to find out-  did she do her homework? What are they going  to tell me? -Yes. Yes And then on Fridays you  get to come and help me. mm hmm.. That'd be wonderful. Now I teach a first grade class every day at 12:10. I know you do a really good  job helping out at home with your niece But she... I do not get to see her Monday, Tuesday,  Wednesday, Thursday But on Friday, I do. Because my mom...  My mom watches her. And sometimes when my sister and I and the baby's not here we actually look at photos of her because we really miss her and  we talk to her on phone. Awesome! She's lucky  to have an aunty like you. Awesome! Well I know because you do  such a good job caring for her that you'd be  an excellent helper for me and my first graders. Will that be  a good goal for you? Okay! So our next section here. Can you read this? When I meet my goal  for the week, I will get to go to... go to Hot Wheels, I think. Well, Hot Wheels is  for the whole nine weeks. But each week.. Remember our... What we're working towards on  Friday, that you get to come... Help you. Right. So you get to  come help Miss. Charles.  on Fridays Okay! You have very nice handwriting. Thank you. Okay! \u000aSo do you. Thanks. Okay. So this goal is something that you're in charge of, right? You're in control  of achieving this goal. But you're not in it alone. Because there's of a lot of people  who want to see you reach that goal. and to see you doing an awesome job at school. So who are some of the people the adults in your life  who are on your team who can be helpers for  you as you reach this goal. My grandma, my aunty,  my uncle, my mom and my sister. Wonderful!  You have a lot of people. So these are people at home that can help you  reach your goal, all right? So let's go ahead and put those  down for supporters at home. Awesome! All right. So you've  got a lot of people supporting you at home. I've got five. And how about here at school? Who's on your team? Miss. Butler and Miss Charles. You've got it girl.  I can't wait to support you on this goal. Okay! So the people  who can help me at school is Miss. Charles Is it okay if I put in Miss. Ficker? my assistance teacher,  because she helps too. Definitely. That's a great person to add. And so are you. Thank you. Okay! I just realized something. What's that? All these teachers  name has a "R" in it. Miss. Charles,  Miss. Butler, Miss. Ficker. It's a good attention  to detail you have there. Okay! So we know  that our goal is to get all my homework completed. Okay! And it's important because you can always get good grades. Excellent. Now on the short-term if you're doing a great job getting  your homework done every week. Each week you will get to come help... come help  Miss. Charles on Friday. Excellent. And I will know that  you're doing a great job because... you can ask Miss. Butler, my grandma and me. That's right. Okay. And over the whole nine weeks when you do a good job getting all that homework done what's your reward? I get to go to Hot Wheels. Awesome. And then although you're  the one in charge of this goal, there's a lot of  people on your team. Who are those people  on your team from home? My Mama, my granny, my sister, my Uncle TJ and my aunty  People on you're side. All right! And then when you're  here at school, who's on your team? Miss. Charles, Miss. Butler, Miss. Ficker Awesome. All right. So what do you think? How's the school going to go? It's going to be great,  because I will follow all of these. Good. and I'm here to help, okay? All right.  Well, I think the first step towards achieving this goal is to make sure that we  manage our time really well. And I know we  talked a little bit before about kind of your month. We looked at  the month of February and figured out what big things you have coming up. What portions of  the day you spend here at school or at Church, and what you do, how you help  out taking care of your niece. So that's the month of February. So what we're going to do  today is really focus on this week and make a plan. So what I've done here is based on the information  you told me before, we've got this week starting with today Monday, February 7th and you will notice I've the time of  day all the way from 6 in the morning throughout the day till Yeah, 10 at night. So I have these spaces blocked off So what are you usually doing Monday, Wednesday,  Friday from 7 to 4? Come to school. You're at school, right? So this whole area Is school? Is school. That's right. You're here at school. Will you write school? \u000aSure. Sometimes it's easy for  me if I just draw a line to show that. Like that. Okay. School. Okay! So knowing that you're in school  from 7 to about 4 O'clock, and we also need  to think about some other regular things that  you do during the week. So you told me before that...\u000a

V  Okay. Look at your music. We are doing four parts, obviously. With them, take just a general idea for the whole thing. Raise your hand if you see or have any eighth notes in the whole song. Raise your hand if you ever sing eighth notes. Sopranos, where do you have eighth notes? Shelby, tell me.\u000a  Measure nine.\u000a  Say it really loud so they all hear you.\u000a  Measure nine.\u000a  Measure nine, very good. Audrey, where do you have eighth notes?\u000a  Measure thirteen.\u000a  Thirteen, good. Reese, where do you have eighth notes?\u000a  Measure nine and measure...\u000a  Measure nine and thirteen.  Hey, what do you notice about the soprano part and the bass part, then? Same rhythm. Almost the same rhythm all the way through. Tenors, where do you have eighth notes? Braden.\u000a  Twenty-one and twenty-two.\u000a  Twenty-one and twenty-two.  So, getting toward the very, very end. Altos, tell us something about your part rhythmically. Raise your hand. Give me a summation of what you do. Jamie.\u000a  We don't have any.\u000a  You don't have any at all? You only have quarter notes, half notes and some whole notes. So, how many beats does a half note take up, everybody?\u000a  Two.\u000a  Two, make sure you last long enough through that and then look up at the whole notes. Solfge, what key are we in? Where is Do? Brady.\u000a  F.\u000a  F major. So, the first pitch that the altos have is...\u000a  Do.\u000a  Do. Sopranos, what's your starting pitch?\u000a  Mi.\u000a  Basses, what's your starting pitch?\u000a  Do.\u000a  Tenors?\u000a  Sol.\u000a  Very good. Look at it for a second, there are some jumps in the very beginning. They don't mess around, right away we've got some eighths and some intervals. Chant on solfge, your part. One and two and three and four and... \u266a  \u266a Very good. Go on. \u266a  \u266a Two, three, four. On the second to last measure on the first page, bassists and altos will move. Stepwise, motions, so you'll--  they both go up one step. Be aware of that. Notice that we have some repetition. Do you see some patterns that are coming back? So, if you miss it the first time, you get a second shot. Where if you get it right the first time, remember what it sounds like so you can do it again. Continuing, second page. One, two, three and chant. \u266a  \u266a Freeze. Let's go back and join the basses with us at measure nine. Do, re, mi. Everyone, measure nine, and... \u266a  \u266a Okay. Sopranos, careful, it might screw up your voice. Why did you have an issue there? Why did you miss it?\u000a  It's a skip.\u000a  Because it's a skip in the melody? And why else? A practical reason.\u000a  Here to here.\u000a  Because it's hard for you to look from the edge of the page down to the next one. Top of the next page, measure seventeen. A little faster, and go. Sorry, seventeen. Sopranos, fa; altos, la; tenors, fa; basses, fa. Ready? Hey, everybody has fa, that might be a good place to find the measure.\u000a  La.\u000a  This will help. You're right, sorry, except the altos. Listen right there when you're actually singing, for that, and go. \u266a  \u266a You'll have to hold this for a very long time. Go back to the beginning. The rule is number six. Jesse, repeat the last step. The last step.\u000a  Oh, never quit singing.\u000a  Never quit singing. Look up, find your keys points. Okay. Second key. \u266a Do mi so mi do so do \u266a \u266a  \u266a Sing your starting note. \u266a  \u266a One, two, three, four. \u266a  \u266a Good. Now, I have two minutes to try to fix and try to correct, to do as much as we can to do a little bit better with this. Take a second and look through the piece and hear it go by in your heads. Do a quick run-through, because it's hard to know. I cant remember what I missed, I'm still freaking out about the whole thing. Take a minute, replay it in your head. Find areas where there were problems for you. Overall, you did extremely well. You listened to each other. You could hear that it sounded like music. If you weren't sure about an interval, you would sing it and then you would go, "Oh, this is right yes," and you were affirmed. And I think you got more confident as you went along. Problem areas. Raise your hands if you had one. Chelsea.\u000a  My problem I had was with measure seventeen.\u000a  Seventeen. Sopranos, do to fa, that's a like a little bit of a tricky leap and some of you hesitated a little bit there. So, then you heard it, and you were able to go on, and then I liked when you got it again when you got back to nineteen. Finding fa, that's a strange function in the music. Yes, Patrick.\u000a  Measure nineteen, fa to la.\u000a  Okay. nineteen, fa to la. Just making sure that you know where you're moving. Fa to la? Where? Oh, nineteen. Yes, sorry. My eyes were at seventeen. Good. Bass hands. Excellent, thank you. Grant, where?\u000a  Twenty.\u000a  Twenty? Yes, and what did you do?\u000a  I couldn't figure out the notes, I mean I couldn't figure out the .\u000a  I think it surprises you because you move up by a step. You were fine, so, la, and the ti, you weren't willing to actually sing ti, because it's not very often that you sing it. Stepwise motion, so, la, ti, do. You did an excellent job, basses, throughout, then returning to so and do when you had it. You had some issues with fa and la. Colin.\u000a  Six and seven. Where we were going from la to fa, and then back to do, and then we had an eighth notes. Because of that...\u000a  Okay. So, being aware of when you have eighth notes. And, chances are there isn't ever a point where you have eighth notes that other people don't. So, when you hear it, then you can move with them, and it's always by step when you have eighth notes. And it's always ascending. So, you don't have to worry about going down anywhere, but, yes, fa and la continue to be icky. I didn't time it. We have to sing it again. I'm so sorry. Okay, so we fixed the things that we missed. We're going a little faster, so it sounds like music, and not just this exercise. Listen across the room to each other.  \u266a Do, mi \u266a  You stayed very well in tune. \u266a Do, mi, so, mi, do, so, do \u266a Set your key. \u266a  \u266a Remember, you always sing with the very best tone that you possibly can. If you look up, basses, I'm trying to help you out some with my hand signs every so often. Sing your first note please. \u266a  \u266a One, two, three, four. \u266a  \u266a Have a seat. And now evaluate yourselves comparing the first reading to the second. That means you need to think about how well you did the first time versus how well you did the second time, and if you haven't had any thoughts or wanted to share anything yet, it's time, because this is opinion time, and there's no wrong. The room is going to tip over from the hands on this side. There are four sections. Jamie.\u000a  Well, sometimes they're like a step away from each other, but something, like, I know they're like one long  and sometimes I .\u000a  Okay. So, there are a couple little slips with stepwise motion that time. Okay, Hannah.\u000a  I thought the sopranos the first time did a lot better than the second time.\u000a  I would agree. The first time you did better than the second. There are a couple of reasons for this. Raise your hand if you feel like, when you think back on how well you've done both times you did better the first time. Why? Why? Emily.\u000a  Because you were so focused and trying to get it right, so the second time we've already gone through it, so we relaxed a little and little things slip up.\u000a  Okay. Some of you may have relaxed just a little bit too much. What else possibly? Colin.\u000a  I think some of us got a little too over-confident.\u000a  Ohhh, that's an excellent thing to check. Just making sure some of you don't get a little over-confident. Although, basses, the fa's and la's were much better this time as an overall section. Amanda.\u000a  If the first time usually there's a few problem areas for me then I try to focus on them way too much and then I see the spots where it might have been tricky for me, like that jump from la to do. So, I freak myself out about that even though I got it right both times.\u000a  You get stuck in your head a little bit.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay. So, doubting yourself and then not being sure. What else can happen? Ariella.\u000a  Along with what Emily said about how we sometimes get over-confident because we've already seen it and we just fly by it because we're not really trying to pay attention to it too much.\u000a  Okay. Ryan.\u000a  Measure nine. It's the so, so, mi. I went back to the so because that's what we did on the first page.\u000a  Oh, okay, because you're remembering, now, the patterns that you had. You get the patterns mixed up when you actually start to sing it the second time. That's a good thought, too. Michaella.\u000a  Between the  and  because we to sing notes over and over again. over and over again. I didn't like it. It's kind of hard. I didn't get the first two notes right and finally on like, the third note. I think I just figured out what we were doing.\u000a  Patrick.\u000a  I think that sometimes  because we've already sung the music and now I think that we kind of know what's going on.\u000a

It's in the air in an invisible form. Kyle.\u000a I think it's evaporated into a gas, and you can't see it.\u000a It evaporated into a gas and you can't see it. Okay, other ideas about C?\u000a I just have similar to Kyle's, but water vapor, you can't usually see it.\u000a Okay, so it became water vapor, which you can't see. Alright. How about D, it moved up to the clouds? Lots of Ds. How about Mina? What do you think?\u000a Well, I think it evaporated, and then it went up, so.\u000a It evaporated and went up. And when things evaporate, they form clouds?\u000a Mm, no.\u000a Okay. So who? Can you explain your ideas?\u000a Well, it was like, actually, it did go into the clouds, because the water's still wet, so...\u000a Okay, so when it evaporates, it goes to clouds. Alright. Other ideas about D? Moving to the clouds. Luke.\u000a I do think that it turned into water vapor.\u000a Okay.\u000a But I think that maybe clouds are there and then it gets soaked up by clouds, sort of.\u000a Okay. So, okay. Let's talk about some of these ideas. So, I'm hearing the word 'evaporate' from a couple different people. What does that mean, to evaporate? What are your ideas about that? Emmie.\u000a Doesn't it mean to like, when the water gets at a certain temperature, it turns into a gas.\u000a Okay, so when water gets to a certain temperature, it changes to a gas. Other ideas about evaporate, or what that means? When it changes to a gas, what's happening? Ideas about that? Mitch?\u000a Well, maybe it first comes out of the machine, maybe the sun could make it heat a lot and sort of the bubble question, like maybe it could be a heat bubble under each town. Not be an actual bubble, but go up to the water cycle and then go, come back down .\u000a Okay, so when you say 'go up to the water cycle' what happens to it?\u000a It's evaporated up.\u000a It's evaporated. And where is it when it evaporates?\u000a In the clouds.\u000a In the clouds. Okay, other ideas? Jake.\u000a Well, when it evaporates, the way it works is the heat makes it so the atoms get, go farther apart, and that makes it change into the state of gas.\u000a Okay, the atoms go farther apart. So, is it still water?\u000a Yes, but in a different form.\u000a Okay. Okay. Other ideas about evaporation? And how about clouds? So, some people are saying when it evaporates, it turns into a cloud. What is a cloud? Ethan, share?\u000a I think it's like a gas.\u000a Okay.\u000a But then I think when it evaporates and goes up to the cloud, and then I think it will be turned into rain.\u000a  I agree. Yeah.\u000a So, first it's a gas when it's a cloud and then it turns back to rain.\u000a Uh-huh.\u000a Okay. Jamie, other ideas?\u000a I think a cloud is, like, water turning into mist, and it gathers in the cloud. So, when it gets dark, it builds up with more water, and then when it rains, all the, the cloud gets too heavy with water, and then it rains.\u000a Okay, so it's a mist.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Is it a liquid or a gas?\u000a A liquid slash, a liquid slash gas.\u000a Okay, a little of both? Okay. Okay, alright. Let's move on. How about E? It changed into a new substance. No takers for E, new substance. Okay. How about F, it went to the sun? It went up to the sun. No takers for F either? There's a lot of hands I'm not seeing up. How about G? It broke down into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen. Alex?\u000a I said that because, well, it goes up into the sky, and it must be really humid because it like, I can't remember, is it when the atoms separate, or, and because we're humidity-ing it? Yeah.\u000a Okay, so it becomes more humid, and that makes the atoms separate? Is that what you're saying?\u000a Well, not exactly. It's hard to find the words.\u000a Okay. Can you try? It separates and that's what makes it humid?\u000a Well, I don't know, I guess.\u000a I'll come back to you. Keep thinking about it. How could you explain your ideas? Joey, what are your ideas?\u000a I, can I go off of Alex?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Oh, so when hot air rises, so when the water gets to a certain temperature, I forgot who said that, but it, the atoms spread apart and change into a gas. And it would be more humid because hot air rises and the gas rises into the clouds.\u000a Okay, so as the hot air rises, the gas rises with it? Is that what you're saying?\u000a Mmhm.\u000a Okay. And the water becomes hydrogen and oxygen as it goes up?\u000a Mmhm.\u000a Okay. Other ideas? Dylan?\u000a Well, so, there's oxygen and hydrogen in the atmosphere, and the atmosphere is gas, and gas doesn't sit at the bottom. It's in the air, which means it's obviously floating, I guess. And so if water turns into vapor, which I think most of us know, and vapor can float, and obviously it's turning into a gas, like oxygen and hydrogen. And so how would water be able to float if it's turning into gases, it's breaking down into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen? It's still almost like a liquid gas, but if it wasn't a gas that consists of things like hydrogen and oxygen, how would it be able to float? How would it be able to turn to clouds?\u000a Okay, so it can't be water still if it's going to be floating around in the air.\u000a Well, yeah.\u000a Is that what you're saying?\u000a It's still water, but it's in a different form, that it has components that make up, it's pretty much a liquid gas, almost.\u000a It's a liquid gas.\u000a Yes, yeah.\u000a Which makes it float in the air.\u000a Well, yeah, gas. Gas can float, and hydrogen and oxygen.\u000a Okay.\u000a So, it becomes hydrogen and oxygen in the air?\u000a Well, as it heats up, then it breaks, because as it heats up, then it creates vapor. Water evaporates, and so as it heats up, when it gets to that point, then it breaks down into atoms and everything else.\u000a Okay, when it gets to the air.\u000a Yeah, when it turns into vapor.\u000a Okay, when it turns into vapor, that's when it becomes hydrogen.\u000a Because yeah, that's how it, when the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen break down, I'm guessing that that means that that's when it's turning into vapor.\u000a Okay. Okay, okay, great. Luke, other ideas?\u000a I think it might become the combination of the two, because I think more than just one, because I think it does split into different atoms, which makes it a gas. And then, um, and then also it could go into the clouds, or something like in other parts of the answer.\u000a Okay, so maybe it turns into this hydrogen and oxygen gas, but then goes to the clouds.\u000a Yeah, because I think that that's kind of the only way to go to the clouds, and I think its probable that it would, so...\u000a Okay. Okay, okay. Lots of different ideas. We're going to move on so that we can get to the others. How could we observe this? What could we do to know if some of these options are the right option, or be able to eliminate them as possible options? What could we do? Turn and talk to your partner, quickly. What could we observe?  And see what happens? Okay. Would we be able to eliminate any of these if we agreed with Owen's suggestion?  Eliminate F? How come?\u000a Because the sun's very far away.\u000a Okay.\u000a And it's really, really hot, so.\u000a Okay, if we did it in the classroom, would it be able to get to the sun? No, it'd be stuck in the classroom, right? Okay. Are there others that we might be able to eliminate if we did that?  Good. Okay, let's hear your ideas. What could we do? How could we observe this scenario?\u000a Trenton, I haven't heard from you today.\u000a Okay, so to eliminate some of them, if soaked into the ground, you could check if the ground was wet or anything, and it moved up to the clouds. You could check if there's any clouds.\u000a Okay. See if a cloud forms. Okay, Miley, other ideas?\u000a I agree with Trenton, but I think I've seen them where the area's curved over, like our roof, and the sun is out, you can see mist kind of stuff coming out. And I think if we did that, then maybe we could observe something that could be useful.\u000a Okay, what would we have to do, though, to set this up? What do we need? Owen.\u000a You can wet a paper towel and then hang it from somewhere and then heat it by a light, and then, or you could have a fan.\u000a Okay, heat it with a light or a fan. So, perfect. I like your idea. So, we have a cloth. It's wet. Is it wet?\u000a Kind of.\u000a Kind of? It's not wet enough? Should we make it a little more wet?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, let me make it a little more wet. That better?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. And in this scenario, this is hanging outside, right? Well, we're going to hang it in our classroom. And since we don't have a lot of sun today, we're going to make our own light energy with this lamp. So, don't look at the lightbulb because it's real bright. There we go. And we're going to set it up here. So as we watch this, which one of these, or which ones, might we be able to eliminate? So as we observe, what can we, how will we know which ones are true or not true? Let me give you a minute to think. I want to hear from someone new I haven't heard from yet. Who haven't I heard from yet? Augustine.\u000a A, because I wasn't sure if the ground was wet or dry.\u000a Perfect, yeah. It can't soak into the ground, right? So, we'll see if the counter is wet, if there's a puddle there, then we'll know that A is the correct answer. Excellent. Others that we might be able to eliminate just by observing? Jake.\u000a B, it disappears and no longer exists, because nothing can't disappear. Something can't disappear unless it goes into a black hole.\u000a Okay, will we be able to observe that, though?\u000a No.\u000a Not really, yeah. So, that one might be tricky, but that's good prior knowledge. Jamie, others that we might be able to eliminate?\u000a We can tell if it moved up to the clouds, because there's no way it can move up to the clouds because there's a ceiling.\u000a Yeah, there's a ceiling. Well, so if we saw a cloud forming in our classroom, right, then we'd know that it makes a cloud. But if we don't see a cloud, then we'll know that we can eliminate that one. That one's wrong. Good. Others that we can eliminate? Miley?\u000a F, it went up to the sun, because it can't, we don't have a sun in the classroom.\u000a If we saw it, right, gathering up the light, right, that might tell us that maybe F is true. But it can't get to the sun because it's stuck in our classroom. Good. Any others that we might be able to eliminate? Emmie?\u000a We might be able to, well, C, because if the cloud isn't wet anymore, and you can't see anything or feel anything, we would know that that's true.\u000a Okay, okay. So, if it disappears, we can't see it or feel it in the cloth, but we can't see it anywhere else, maybe we'll know that C is more likely. Okay, good. Very good. Excellent. So, we're going to keep observing for these things. Those are the things that we want to keep an eye out, look for a cloud forming, look for water puddling at the bottom, look for water gathering at the light. See if it chemically changed into a new substance, we might be able to see it, right, in our classroom somewhere. So, we'll be observing for that. Is it going to happen immediately?\u000a No.\u000a No, so we'll have to come back to this one. Keep looking back as we go. In the meantime, uh-oh. No, here we go. We'll go to the next one, next scenario. What's in the bubbles? So, turn to that scenario in your notebook if you're not there right now. What's in the bubbles? So, Hannah is boiling water in a glass teakettle. She notices bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle that rise to the top, and wonders, "What is in the bubbles?" She asks her family what they think. This is what they say. So, who agrees with Dad? Who may agree with Dad? Owen.\u000a Well, since it's being heated, and being heated from the bottom, the bubbles will form on the bottom as heat, and then the heat would make it rise to the top.\u000a Okay, the heat makes it rise to the top. Good. Other ideas? Other people who agree with Dad? Mitch?\u000a Well, I agree with Dad and Calvin.\u000a Okay.\u000a And for Dad, if the bubbles are heat, maybe the heat forms the bubbles and then the oxygen in the bubbles makes it float to the top.\u000a Okay, okay. So, let's move on to Calvin then. Other thoughts about Calvin. Who agrees, the bubbles are filled with air? Reed?\u000a I forgot.\u000a Okay, we'll come back to you.\u000a Anybody else agree with Calvin? Anyone I haven't heard from yet today? No? Trenton, anything for you to contribute?\u000a Well, I didn't at first, and I don't really know if I do still, but like I kind of do, because with the water, all water has oxygen in it, which is kind of like air, and then the air could be in the bubbles because the bubbles would probably heat up and be at the bottom, and then the air would fill up from the water and go into the bubbles, and then .\u000a Okay, so there's air in the water, and as it heats up, it comes out of the water. Okay, other ideas? Miley?\u000a I agree with Trenton and Mitch, because they could be both filled with air, but they could be hot, because it's where the source of heat is.\u000a Okay, alright. Reed, did you remember?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay, go ahead.\u000a Well, the heat can take the air out of the water.\u000a The heat would take the air out of the water, like Trenton was saying.\u000a And since air's lighter than water, it would rise to the top.\u000a It goes to the top. Okay, good. How about Grandma? The bubbles are an invisible form of water. Anyone agree with Grandma? Rupo.\u000a I said I believe with Grandma because I thought that they'd go up to the top. I thought it was just invisible because I thought it was just going up, and the cloud's just evaporating higher and higher.\u000a Okay, so there are, the bubbles are evaporated water.  And then go away. Okay. Matthew?\u000a Well, it had to be a form of water, because it came from water, I guess, and they're invisible, so yeah.\u000a Okay, so it had to be water because it's coming from water, and you can't see it, so it's invisible.\u000a Uh-huh.\u000a Great. How about Mom? The bubbles are empty, there's nothing inside them. Who agrees with Mom? Who agrees with Mom? Jonathan?\u000a I think that there's nothing inside the bubbles because how could anything get in the bubbles in the first place? How could that turn into bubbles?\u000a Okay, how could anything be in there? Where would it have come from?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. Anybody else agree with Mom? Anybody else agree with Mom? Okay, how about Lucy? The bubbles contain oxygen and hydrogen that separated from the water. Lots of hands. Who haven't I heard from today? Jodie.\u000a Well, I don't really know why, because it just sounded more scientific. \u000a Sounds more scientific. Okay. Any other reasons?\u000a No.\u000a No? Alright. Kyle, can you add on to that?\u000a I think in the water, when it's not hot, that there's oxygen and hydrogen and other things in it, and then when it heats up, it forms into, I don't know. It rises up.\u000a Okay, so where did the oxygen and hydrogen come from?\u000a I think it's part of the water.\u000a It's part of the water. Okay. Good. Emmie?\u000a Well, I know that, I'm pretty sure water is made of two oxygen molecules and one hydrogen molecule.\u000a Opposite.\u000a Oh, other way around.\u000a Yup, two hydrogens and one oxygen. You're right.\u000a Okay, and I'm with Lucy because bubbles usually kind of probably form by the water, and inside, and since the water's  the molecules, that that's what's happening.\u000a Okay, so water--\u000a

V Ah, okay. Okay.\u000a Suri does this only happens in vinegar or can it happen in water?\u000a Try it tomorrow. We're going to experiment more with this, okay? This is, can I have your attention up here again? I'm just trying to help you by sharing observations I hear when I go around the room. Somebody had a question and I love questions. They said, does this happen when you put it in water the same way that it happens if you put it in vinegar because I have told you all it's vinegar. If you have questions like that could you please write them on the side so that I know what investigations you'd like to do in the future? So we can, because we're going to be continuing this. Now, once you've made all of your observations, you still have that column like we've had from every little activity today that says, what could be happening. So, let me be more specific. I want you to tell me, again, the title of the lab is, where's the matter? I want you to tell me where that tablet went. I want you to look at your observations. I want you to be specific. And I want you to tell me where's the matter. What happened to the tablet? Okay, in that last column you should only have one box to fill in. Please discuss it with your lab group and write down where it went. What happened to it. And then we'll all discuss it together. \u000a It can do both, can't it? So, you think it turned into a gas. You think it dissolved and turned into a gas okay, so you can absolutely write both. Next thing we're going to talk about is how we prove that. So, if any of you guys have a really quick idea think about how you can do an experiment. Okay, so keep thinking along those lines because you're going to design your experiment for it, okay. I have balloons. I see the word dissolves. I saw the word fizzy and escape. Okay. Alright, I'm going to write down some of these words that I'm seeing. I saw dissolved. I know. I saw escaped. Fizzy was in the same sentence as escaped, but thank you for reminding me. Did you have fizzy separately?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Oh, okay. On your observation sight or what could happen?\u000a Yeah, what could happen.\u000a What could happen, okay.\u000a Blended, okay.\u000a I had gas.\u000a You had chemical reaction?\u000a Bubbles.\u000a Did I pretty much get the kinds of things you think may have happened? Any, any totally different ideas that you think happened? You think it was still...\u000a It became carbon dioxide.\u000a Okay, alright. Alright, focus up here then. Good. I see the same mixture. When I did the first demonstration first thing you said was magic. Then someone said chemical reaction. Dissolved, disappeared, changed, neutralized. I see the same combination of words. Dissolved, escaped, fizzy, blended, vanished, chemical reaction, magic. I just see a little different priority, okay. Now I'm a scientist. I can't really test magic. Can't really test if something was magic. What I can test are the science type words. I can test chemical reaction. I can test blended. I can sort of test fizzy. Escaped, dissolved. These I can test. I can try to figure out a way to determine whether the tablet dissolved or escaped. Or a combination of both. I can figure out if it being fizzy had something to do with it. I can figure out if it was blended in. I can figure out if it was a chemical reaction or I can let you do this. And that's what I'm going to do. On your other half sheet, you should have another half sheet on your table. First thing I need you to do is, in your group, I need you to come to a consensus. That means you guys have got to agree. The first question on there says, okay, where's the disappearing matter? But I asked you to think about it in terms of everything you've seen today. I magically changed clear liquid into pink liquid and then pink liquid back into clear liquid again. You saw a candle magically get shorter and the wick magically disappearing and some black stuff come out of nowhere and you saw an alka-seltzer tablet vanish. Okay. So, your group needs to agree on an overall theory. Where's the disappearing matter? I want you to discuss it and I want you all to write the exact same sentence for where's the disappearing matter at the top of your paper. Okay, so you have to agree.\u000a There was a small piece that I put in right now and the alka-seltzer went up.\u000a So, you know that it goes to the bottom not to the top. Okay. That's a great observation because its very specific. I like it. So, you all need to talk about... Okay so, in every single experiment it turned into a gas? So, the pink liquid turned into a gas? And the white liquid turned into a gas? And when the clear liquid went pink liquid, the wax turned into a gas? I didn't even see it disappear. Oh, when you blew it out you saw smoke, so when you blew it out, the amount of smoke that went off, do you think it was equal to the amount of candle that's missing?\u000a Oh, the liquid was a solid, this is a gas, so...\u000a Tell me about the liquid again. Because I only saw liquid so I keep... \u000a If the pink was less dense than the white. \u000a If the density explained it, have you ever seen liquids that have different densities combined? Have you ever seen oil in water? Okay, so what does it look like when you have two different density liquids? Did you see layers with the... \u000a Where'd the pink stuff go? Disappeared by itself? Okay. So, these are the things you guys have to talk about. You can't just take one person's, you guys gotta make sure you all agree and it has to be an explanation that explains all three events that we saw today. So, when I say where's the disappearing matter, you tell me it turned into a gas. I'm going to say, okay then the pink liquid turned into a gas? I didn't see bubbles. Okay. So, it has to be a sentence that explains it all. You guys aren't talking here. Okay. The disappearing matter is in the liquid. So, you still think the alka-seltzer tablet is in there?  Okay, so you think it's in there, but it's now bubbles? Okay. It's in there, but it's now bubbles so it changed in to bubbles and then what about the pink liquid and the clear liquid? You think it's all still in there? Okay, but that time no bubbles, but it's still in there. Okay, so candle. Where did the rest of the wick go? Is it still there? Okay, so you were good for two out of three, but you can't say it's still in there for the candle, so change your sentence. Talk about it. Change your sentence just a little bit. I get that you're saying that. Right. But change your sentence a little bit so it applies to all three events. Okay. What's your sentence that everyone has agreed on?\u000a That matter turns into...\u000a So, you had bubbles in your candle?\u000a No.\u000a Oh, this is supposed to be, to explain all three events we saw today. Okay. This is a good start, but it has to be more general. Where is the disappearing matter in general today? Dissolved is good for this one? Is this one dissolved?\u000a Nope.\u000a Okay, so can you think of something dissolved and melted have in common so you can make it one sentence to explain everything. \u000a Okay, doesn't show up anymore does that mean it's gone?\u000a Okay, that's where you have to agree. You have to agree whether it is gone or not. Okay? Okay, stop for just one second. I talked to a couple of really good groups, but a couple of groups are very stuck because they disagree. I told you you all had to agree and you had to explain all three things. It's like the most difficult thing you can possibly do. He won't listen to you. I hear you. Okay, I'm listening. Here's the thing. In the disagreements I've seen, the disagreement is is it gone or is it not gone? Does that make sense? Okay. Did it go away? Did it disappear or is it still in there? That's the disagreement. Now, I have an idea. What if we, let's pick one experiment, okay. I think for this class, the easiest experiment to deal with would be the tablet. The alka-seltzer and the vinegar, okay. Write that down on that half sheet as the experiment we chose. The experiment, we chose the alka-seltzer. We're going to choose that as a class. What are the materials we put in? \u000a The tablet and the vinegar. Write those down on that left side. It says materials we put in. Do we put in anything else? I didn't trick you, I swear. Okay, so we had vinegar and we had a tablet. What did you see come out?\u000a Bubbles.\u000a We've got bubbles so write those on the right hand side. We've got bubbles. Fizz. He thinks, he's saying he thinks the fizz is carbon dioxide. That's fine. We can call it whatever you want and what some kind of guess and what else? Are you left with anything else? You're still left with some liquid, right? Okay, so write that down. You're left with, you've got bubbles and you're left with bubbly liquid. Here's what I think we need to prove. We need to prove if what we put in is the same as what we got out. How we can tell if something's there if we can't see it in science? Okay, you've got bubbles. What do you think, Nick? We weigh the vinegar and the alka-seltzer tablet   we add the numbers up and then weigh it afterwards and see of the number's the same.\u000a

V Okay, alright. Okay, okay. So, that's his position. He's going to stick with it for a minute, but then he might have to go around, he might change his mind, alright? Okay. This group agreed with Fernando, okay? That it's because the Earth orbits closer to the sun in the summer than in the winter. Who would like to share they're thinking? I'll call on you if you don't . So, what do you think?\u000a Well, I think it's because since the Earth like orbits around the sun, like in an oval, when it gets here it would be warmer because it's closer to the sun.\u000a Okay.\u000a And it's winter when it's away from the sun .\u000a Okay. So, can you go and draw that on the board, what you mean? Because I heard you say that the Earth orbits around the sun in the shape of an oval. Raise your hand if you agree with that. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, that's the Earth and it's orbiting around the sun and he said that the shape of the path that it travels as it orbits is an oval, okay? Anybody else in this group has something to add to help him defend Fernando? Okay, I see. Can I read what you wrote?\u000a Sure.\u000a He said that the orbit is not a perfect circle. So, that's sort of what he's saying there. Is that right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a And how would it not being a perfect circle affect the difference in summer, winter temperature or heat?\u000a Well, we know that the Earth, if it was a perfect circle the seasons wouldn't change.\u000a Okay.\u000a It would be the same.\u000a Alright. Okay.\u000a Depending where the Earth is--\u000a Alright, okay. Anybody else have something they want to add in this group? Okay. Now anybody based on these two groups? Anybody want to move from their group to these two groups? Not yet. Okay, that's alright. Okay. Now let's go to Raul, okay. This group agrees with Raul and he says it's because the Earth's tilt changes the angle of the sunlight hitting the Earth. Defend yourselves.\u000a So, I remember learning that the tilt of the axis is the reason for the seasons. But I read the question again, it says the Earth still changes and if it doesn't change it stays the same.\u000a Okay. Let's read it again. Read it really simple.\u000a It says it's because the Earth's tilt changes the angle of sunlight hitting Earth.\u000a Okay. So, it says the Earth's tilt changes the angle of sunlight.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Does it say it changes the tilt of the Earth?\u000a No.\u000a Okay. So you going to stick with what you said or you want to change? Can you show me? If I give you something can you show me what you mean?\u000a Alright.\u000a Okay. So, I'm going to give you an apple and I want you to pretend it's the Earth, okay? And I'm going to stick this bamboo skewer through it, well it didn't go exactly right, but just pretend. So, what does this represent based on what you just said?\u000a This is the axis of the Earth.\u000a So, this is the axis and what does the axis do?\u000a .\u000a Okay. So, the Earth rotates around the axis which is what Ryan said, right? Okay. And be careful because I just poked myself. I want you to be careful . Okay. So, can you stand up and show me what you mean and let's have someone else in your group that agrees with you be the sun and stand kind of in the middle of the room right here, okay? Alright. So she's the sun, you're the Earth, show us what you mean, okay?\u000a Okay. Well, the Earth orbits the sun--\u000a Alright. What's the word you were just about to say though? Revolves? I think that might be okay, too. What do you guys think? Do you think revolve and orbit might be the same?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, alright.\u000a It doesn't matter.\u000a Okay, so you're going to have to make the-- Go around the outside of the desk for your orbit, okay?\u000a Well, it orbits the sun in a tilt.\u000a Okay. Which one is tilt?\u000a I forgot how many degrees.\u000a Okay. Alright, okay. So keep going.\u000a It orbits in an angle.\u000a Alright. Hold it the way you think it's supposed to be. Okay.\u000a I think it's this one. I'm pretty sure.\u000a Alright. So she's tilting it, but now, and it's tilted. Right now it's away from the sun, is that right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. Now keep coming around . Of course does it make a little job to play that?\u000a No.\u000a But we're just imagining those who were in this room . Okay. Now stop there for a minute. Is your axis pointing where you want it to?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay, alright. Keep going. You guys need to make space for her to come through on her orbit. Okay, alright. So, does that help some of you? How many people think that she's right? That the Earth tilts as it's going around its orbit? It's actually kind of spinning on its axis while it's going around, right? Is that right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a It's spinning the whole time, right? What does that spinning give us? What does that spinning give us?\u000a Day and night.\u000a The spinning gives us day and night, okay? Right? Okay. Because one side of the Earth is facing the sun it's what?\u000a Day.\u000a And the other side is in?\u000a Night.\u000a Okay, alright. Okay, alright. This group over here. You guys agree with--\u000a Susan.\u000a Susan, okay? And Susan said that she thinks it's because the northern hemisphere is closer to the sun in summer than in winter. So, what do you think?\u000a So, like she said that its axis is tilting, but as it moves around the sun the northern and southern hemisphere are closer and farther away.\u000a Okay.\u000a But on this side the southern hemisphere is closer. \u000a Alright.\u000a And when it comes over here, the northern hemisphere is closer in the sun and--\u000a Alright. Anybody else in this big room have something to add?\u000a Well, I agree with her, Natalie. Because as it is tilted, I believe, that, and so when it goes around the sun shines bright and as it's turning and so as it goes around it will change where the light is hitting it.\u000a Okay. Can someone add to that or give us more detail?\u000a I'm also pretty sure that like the state of Texas it's more closer towards the equator and so it doesn't have all of the seasons.\u000a Okay. So, you think that places on the equator, right here, they don't have four seasons? Summer, fall, winter, right?\u000a I think they do have seasons, they're just not as different as like --\u000a Okay. So, there's not much, that difference in the heat from the sun and the winter versus the summer?\u000a Yeah.\u000a I think they're always getting the same amount depending on--\u000a The same amount of what?\u000a The same amount of sunlight and heat. Because they're getting it directly almost.\u000a Okay. Alright.\u000a \u000a Why do you think that? What makes you say that? So, you think the orbit is elliptical like this group, Fernando's group agreed. But it's not enough to change the difference in temperature.\u000a I don't think heat really varies depending on, I mean it varies, but not in that small of a scale, depending on where it is. And so just that little, teeny movement, ellipse or something, will not change--\u000a Okay, alright. Okay. I think we have another group over here. How about the Shakira agree-ers. Do you want to move now? Okay. Okay. Everybody if you want to move to a different table go for it now, okay? Nobody agreed with Warner, huh? Okay. So Eva's out, alright? People don't think that it gives off more heat, right, in the summer than the winter in Warner's group, right? So we're down to-- And Shakira's out, right? Alright. Who said to me that they didn't agree with any of them?\u000a I changed my mind.\u000a You changed your mind? Okay. Alright. So, here's what I want you to do now, okay? I want to do another little demonstration, okay? Would you be the sun? Okay. And would you be the Earth? Now here's what I want you to do for me. I want you to orbit around the sun. I want you to pick a spot. Like let's say that yellow bucket, okay? And as you're going around I want you to keep the axis pointed at that yellow bucket no matter where you are. Can you do that?\u000a Yes.\u000a Alright. Give it a try. Alright. Alright. Now stop for a second right there. Okay. He's still pointed at that yellow bucket, right? Keep going. Alright, stop right there. He's still pointed pretty much at the yellow bucket and you're tilted over a little bit, right? Like she said. Because we all kind of agree pretty much. These two groups agreed with that. What season is it right now? In the northern hemisphere? What season is it right now in the northern hemisphere?\u000a Winter.\u000a Winter. Why is it winter in the northern hemisphere?\u000a Because it's farther away from the sun--\u000a Okay. So, it's pointing away from the sun, right? Do you think it's because the northern hemisphere is farther away?\u000a No, because it's tilted away.\u000a Tilted away?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. Alright, keep coming around here now. Keep pointing at the yellow bucket. It's a little bit hard to do, huh? Okay, stop right there. What season is it right now?\u000a Would it be spring? Perhaps.\u000a It would be spring in the northern hemisphere. What is it in the southern hemisphere?\u000a Fall.\u000a Okay. So it's the opposite, right? Okay, keep coming around here. Alright, keep pointing at the yellow bucket. Now what season is it in the northern hemisphere? What season is it in the northern hemisphere now? This group over here? Somebody in this group.  the table. What is it?\u000a Summer.\u000a Summer. Why is it summer in the northern hemisphere?\u000a Because it's closer to the sun.\u000a Closer to the sun?\u000a And it's like, kind of like--\u000a Are we like a few hundred or thousand miles away from the sun? A few hundred or a few thousand? Or like a few million?\u000a Yeah. Okay. So, in the scope of that, it's hard to picture, do you think that the distance between this spot and this spot is that much compared to the sunlight coming over?\u000a Yeah.\u000a To make it that different? Okay. So, you think it's more the tilt.\u000a Exactly.\u000a Okay. I'm not sure in your past science classes, what is it about heat energy and light energy pointed on something that makes something warmer or colder? Anybody have an idea?\u000a Depending on how direct it is because what I was thinking is like if this is the sun and, can I come up?\u000a Come show us.\u000a So, if my pencil's the heat and the light it would be coming from here and it would be coming and it would hit with him, this one more.\u000a Right.\u000a And this one will be direct.\u000a Okay.\u000a So, I think what he's saying is that both the northern and southern hemisphere are still getting sun, aren't they?\u000a Yes.\u000a Because we're so far away that the only, which side of the Earth is not getting sun right this minute?\u000a This side.\u000a When it's rotating it's night time. But during the day is it still pretty much light in the northern and southern hemisphere?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah. So, what he's saying is that it's more direct to the hemisphere that's tilted, right, toward the sun. It's still getting sun and somebody over here said something about the equator, the places on the equator.\u000a Those over there.\u000a Who said that? Say that again.\u000a Like states or, I'm not sure--\u000a Any locations, right?\u000a So like for Texas, as an example, I'm not sure if it's exactly on the equator, but I know it's really close to the equator.\u000a Okay. Closer than we are.\u000a Yeah. \u000a Okay.\u000a I just read somewhere that it doesn't have all of the seasons.\u000a Okay.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Somebody else said I think as much difference or variation.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. So, this is summer in the northern hemisphere. Now we're going to cut across our orbit and save time, go back over to that side and what season was that again?\u000a Winter.\u000a What season was that again? What season is it now in the northern hemisphere? Winter, okay. So, which hemisphere is getting more direct sunlight now? The southern hemisphere. And what season is it now in the southern hemisphere?\u000a Summer.\u000a Summer, okay. Alright.\u000a Because the heat's having to go around--\u000a Okay. So, let's go back for a second. Raul's group said it's because the tilt doesn't change, but the tilt, as you're going around, changes the angle of the sunlight that's hitting the Earth, okay? That's Raul's group. You guys still agree with that?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. And Susan's group said it's because the northern hemisphere is closer to the sun in the summer than it is in the winter. Anybody want to move groups now?\u000a Wait. Does that mean more direct or--\u000a Well--\u000a Or literally closer?\u000a Literally closer. Okay. Anybody want to move groups?  Okay. That's okay.  You don't have to change, alright? And this group  with Fernando that is because the Earth orbits closer to the sun in the summer than in the winter. Alright. I'm going to show you something and I'm going to see if it changes your mind, okay?\u000a Do we get to eat the apples afterwards? \u000a Well, we'll see, okay? Alright. Okay. So, take a look up here. Alright. This is a simulation. What do I mean by a simulation? You can come back and sit down with your group. What do I mean by a simulation?\u000a It's a photo or a video of what actually--\u000a Right. It's not out in the universe looking back at our Earth. It's not from the space station or anything like that, okay? So take a look. Alright. And look at what's happening with the axis. It's a little bit hard to see on the screen. Okay. Did you notice how like what we tried to do, It stayed pointing the same direction, right? Let's do it one more time. Okay, alright. Okay. Now does this look kind of like what he drew on the board at the beginning? Does it look like an ellipse?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Or an oval?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. So, I wish I had a glass, a clear glass.\u000a We do right over there.\u000a We have a clear glass?\u000a That's alright. We can use this. Okay.\u000a There is one over there.\u000a We can use this. Okay. I want you, and you're looking at this, kind of from the side. Does it look like that? When you're looking at the rim of this cup or the rim of this glass from the, sort of the side does it look like an oval?\u000a Yes.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. Let me make sure you can see that. It does, doesn't it? When you're looking at it from that angle. But look at it straight down now. What does it look like?\u000a A circle.\u000a It looks like a perfect circle. Let's let a couple people experience that. Look at it from the side, now look at it straight down.\u000a With this one you're almost looking, you're looking like right here.\u000a Okay.\u000a So, the glass it was right there--\u000a I want you guys to try it too, okay? Alright. It might. But what I want you to think about here is this is sort of what you guys probably saw in your fifth grade science books, maybe even in your middle school science books. We'll have to take a look at the pictures in our books. You know, publishers, the people who print the books, they don't always do things the right way for us to work. And do you know that there are many, hundreds and thousands of adults, maybe millions of adults, who think that the orbit of the Earth looks like this because this is what they saw in their science books when they were kids growing up. But just like the glass, what happens? I'm going to do it again, but I'm going to flip it over. We're looking at it from up above. So, look what's happening now.\u000a It's a circle.\u000a Yeah. And did you know that the Earth's orbit, it is slightly an oval, but so slightly that it's really close to a perfect--\u000a

V  ... tilted towards the Sun, you're closer to the sun, which is heat, which means you're going to be warmer. When you're tilted away from the Sun, then there's less heat, because you're farther away from it, it's going to be colder. That's what changes the seasons.\u000a  Once again, it goes in orbit. Like you said, the closer we are to the Sun, or the father away, once again it goes back to being an elliptical orbit.\u000a  I think that tilt causes the seasons, and the closer we are tilted to the Sun, that means it's like Summer or Spring, then if we're tilted back, it's Winter or Fall.\u000a  I'm kind of understanding what you guys are saying. Because I'm thinking of it as like, say, like the globe that's sitting right there, say that Ben was the sun...\u000a  You can use that if you'd like.\u000a Say that Ben was the Sun, the Sun would be shining at the bottom of the globe, because the globe's tilted. So, there wouldn't be much Sun at the top of the sphere because that's the most tilted away from the Sun. So, it would cause Summer lower and on the other side it would cause Winter.\u000a  Why are you shaking your head?\u000a  I disagree. I think the Sun would hit more on top than it does on the bottom, because like Antarctica and stuff, always cold, and it's at the bottom. So, I think it hits more in the top and in between, like by the equator. Because as you go down South, it's more warmer, but still, if you go down, way down to Antarctica, it's totally freezing, they don't get no sun.\u000a  That's not right. Because... there is like sunlight in Antarctica and stuff. It's just 'cause like, the latitude and longitude, and like, because... Because, Antarctica's at zero degrees. So, it's cold down there.\u000a  I want to know, when the Sun is going in its orbit, if it just goes from this to this, like boom, or if its turning and its like facing the Sun like that, like, I don't understand that.\u000a  Okay. So, our question is what?\u000a Like, when you're going around the Sun, and its on its axis like this, tilted, and it goes around, eventu... Does it just, like, go like that? Like real quick? And then it's like shifted so the bottom is getting more light, and that would put us in Winter?\u000a  What do you think, Kaylie? You haven't said anything. Do you think that our, our tilt's going to just change?\u000a  No. I think it's like, whenever we're rotating, like it goes around the Sun in the orbit?\u000a  Can I show... She's saying that as it's rotating, it's staying the same, it's just that it's changing because you're changing position from which way the Sun is.\u000a  Can I show an example with the globe?\u000a  Yeah, please.\u000a  Say the Sun was in the middle. Say, like the globe, is right here. Say we're right here, it's Summertime, really close, and the Sun's right here. And as we go around, like maybe, like we're right here and this is Fall, and then we go to Winter. And as we turn this way for the Spring, and then we're back to Summer again because we're going around the sun, so...\u000a  But , the only problem with that is we're still going to be tilted away when it, when we go over towards the Sun. We're still going to be tilted away, won't we?\u000a  Well the Earth's always tilted.\u000a  Yeah, but we'll be tilted away. In the Summer you're tilted towards the Sun.\u000a  Let's go back to, does the tilt change? Okay, so we're definitely talking about this tilt, and I'm guessing there's a lot of kids that are a little unsure about the tilt? Yes? So, if you think you understand the tilt, help everybody else understand. We're not getting this tilt in what you're talking about. So, explain it the best way you can, and help each other, okay so... "I don't get this tilt." Does it just flip flop? What do you think, Anna?\u000a  I think it stays the same?\u000a  What about you, Shana? You haven't said anything yet.\u000a  Well, as the Earth goes around in its orbit, it shifts, just like a little bit that way, you're like closer to the Sun. And then during the Winter, we're father away.\u000a  Is that how it is? We're closer towards the Sun in the Summer and we're father away in the Winter?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Who doesn't think that?\u000a  Could I try something with the globe real quick?\u000a  Yes!\u000a  Could I borrow Nick, to be my Sun? \u000a  Yeah. Be his Sun, Nick.\u000a Come on, Sun. Go out there and stand in the middle.\u000a  Pretty dark Sun.\u000a  Yeah, you are.\u000a Okay, we're gonna say that this little pin here is where the Sun is hitting today. All right? And we're spinning, woah, spinning that way.  It's spinning, it's spinning, it's spinning, it's spinning, but it never, it never tilts back towards the Sun. That's what I don't understand, does it just go like this? \u000a  This is a really good question. This is a really good question. Now I want, wait, don't move yet. I want, go ahead, be the Sun still. And I want you to walk around and explain to people what you're talking about. Number one, show us the tilt.\u000a Okay, that's the tilt.\u000a  Show everybody the tilt.\u000a Okay, everyone, this, Nick move, you're in the way of people.\u000a  Just duck down, just crouch.\u000a And this is the way of the tilt, the way it's tilted that way. But as we go around it's still tilted that way. And this side here is still far away, so what? It's going to stay Winter all the time? Or is it just going to like flip? And be like, "Hey guys, look! Now we're Summer, but we're upside-down." That's what I don't understand.\u000a  He has a very good question, okay? His question is, why is, what hemisphere are you talking about?\u000a The Northern Hemisphere.\u000a  Okay.  So, why is the Northern Hemisphere always tilted towards the Sun, how he's walking away? Because his argument is, that...\u000a  Oh, I have it right here.\u000a  Go ahead.\u000a  It says, "Because the Earth's axis is slightly tilted, when the North Pole is laying towards the Sun and South Pole is laying away from the Sun. And when the South Pole is leading towards the Sun, the North Pole is leading away from the Sun." It says, "As a result, the number of daylight hours in the Northern and Southern hemisphere are not constantly recalled because the Earth is divided in two halves of the hemisphere by the equator, the hemisphere that leads towards the Sun has a long day and short nights." Does that have to do with anything?\u000a  See, I...\u000a  Wait! Does that have to do with anything? That's Sabrina's question. Does that have to do with anything? So summarize, what you just read to us.\u000a  Does the tilt have, like also have to do with like, the days, and like the short days and short nights?\u000a  Does the tilt have to do with the short days and long nights, and long days and short nights? Shawn, you're shaking your head yes. You think it does have to do with it?\u000a  Say yes?\u000a  Yes?\u000a  You think it does have to do with it? Why? Who could help him explain, why would a tilt change the length of day? Move over, Lucas.\u000a  Because, like it's if, like it'll be indirect Sun if it's tilted away from it? And instead of like... I don't know.\u000a \u000a I think it is because I think another thing in the direct rays because, the way we're tilted, it's the number of daylight hours because of the less Sun, as much of the Sun because of the tilt, and how the Sun hits it when its on its tilt? I think, like, see how it tilted that way?\u000a  No, why don't you use it? Why don't you boys sit down and let... Pass that globe over to Byers, and let him explain.\u000a What I think is... You know how it's tilted this way? Maybe it'll tilt the opposite direction for the Summer. Like instead of it being tilted towards this, it'll tilt the other way for the South. Instead of the North be showing, the South would be showing. That's what I think.\u000a  Where is the Sun? That's what I'm not understanding.\u000a The Sun would usually be in the middle.\u000a  You need a hand?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay, go ahead, be the Sun again.\u000a The Sun's in the middle. And that's why if it's tilted this way, we're getting our Sun, but I thought if it would tilt the opposite way, like instead of being tilted this way, it'd tilt that way, then the South would get more Sun?\u000a  Okay? So, how... But what you're asking is the same question as Lucas.\u000a Yeah.\u000a  How does that other hemisphere become tilted towards the Sun? That's what you're trying to figure out. Whenever Lucas walked it around, the whole time, what hemisphere was pointing towards the Sun?\u000a  The Southern Hemisphere was pointing towards the Sun. And the Northern Hemisphere was pointing away from the Sun.\u000a  Ben?\u000a  No, I thought it was the Northern was pointing to the Sun, and the Southern was pointing  the other way.\u000a  But, it remained constant the whole orbit.\u000a  Yes. That's what I couldn't figure out, like how did it just like, did it like flip around and all of the sudden...\u000a  Maybe the Sun?\u000a  ... it changed?\u000a  What do you guys think? Does the Sun move? JJ, you haven't been in here yet.\u000a  I think like every day, it moves a little to the other side.\u000a  Wait, what does?\u000a  The Earth.\u000a  The Earth moves everyday?\u000a  Yeah, it might.  Like it tilts every day.\u000a  It tilts, the tilt is changing? Is that what you're saying? So, the tilt changes? What were you gonna say?\u000a I think the... It... The... Earth, like doesn't move, like when it stays in one spot, I think it might like flip. Like kind of like, just go around, like...\u000a  Can you show us? Do you wanna show us?\u000a Sure, I'll try.\u000a   ...I was gonna say maybe like, as it's, as like the Earth turns around, maybe it like, tilts forward every so often and backward.\u000a  So you're telling me the tilt is changing though and it flips?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Okay, so what are you saying?\u000a It just goes around like this, and eventually it just like, spins around.\u000a  So, it spins on top of its rotation?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  What do you think, Brad?\u000a  I think, yeah, I kind of agree with him.\u000a  Wait, with who?\u000a  with David. While it's like going around its orbit, it just like tilts.\u000a  So the tilt is changing?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  What do you think, Alec? You haven't said anything yet.\u000a  I don't agree with him. I think that it spins while its moving around?\u000a  Don't raise your hand, you don't have to raise your hand.\u000a  Only this, like what Nick just did, or maybe every day it goes a little bit, and tilts like this. And the Sun hits more of the Southern.\u000a \u000a  It's like, everyday, goes a little bit, little bit, little bit, so where the South starts to get more Sun. Because like when we're in Summer and Australia has Winter. So, when we're in Winter, Australia has Summer. So... And it's in the Southern half and we're in the Northern half.\u000a  Wait! \u000a  Tiffany, you were shaking your head. Do you agree with what he's saying?\u000a  Sort of, yeah. Because, if... one spot on the hemisphere gets more sunlight, the most likely it's gonna be warmer than the other. Like he was saying, when we get more sunlight, and the temperature's warm up here, the temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere get a little colder if they don't have as much sunlight, and not as much warmth.\u000a You see what I mean? Like say I'm right here, the Sun is tilted, so you see how the Sun's right here? And then it tilts  a little bit like this. We're still getting Summer sunlight, but Australia's getting more sunlight.\u000a  I have to agree with what JJ said earlier. It tilts everyday.\u000a  So the tilt is changing? You think that the tilt is changing? Morgan, you think the tilt is changing?\u000a  No, I don't think it's changing. I think it's staying the same, because even, I think the rotation helps, because if it goes around the orbit, even though its rotating it helps. Like... Nick, you're the Sun like, and the axis stays, and when it rotates, the Earth rotates, and it's like kind of, it like helps us. I don't know, like indirect sunlight? I don't know. Something like that.\u000a  I can show what she means, I think.\u000a  Go ahead.\u000a  I think it's also about the gravitational pull. Like, when it goes around farther there's less gravitational pull.\u000a  As it goes around farther, there's less gravitational pull. Okay, when you do this, Grace, please explain to me what it is. So, that everybody here that's watching can try and make sense of what we're talking about.\u000a  I think what she's saying is like, say Nick's the Sun again. Since the Northern is that way, I think she's saying is, it doesn't rotate but this is, but we're kind of going around kind of like this? So, then it changes. So now the Southern is towards the Sun and the Northern is that way. So, now it's changed.\u000a  She did something very different in her orbit. Did anybody catch that?\u000a  Yeah, yeah.\u000a  Like she, it didn't move, it just went around like, around the Sun?\u000a  What do you mean it didn't move?\u000a  The Earth stayed still and just moved at one point.\u000a  It didn't do that.\u000a \u000a  Okay, let's do it again, okay? And I want you to make sure that, number one, everybody sees where you start, and everybody sees what happens to the Earth as she's showing you how it's going around. So, explain to us. What is this? Where are we starting?\u000a Okay, we're starting out this way with the Northern towards the Sun, and the Southern away from the Sun. And as we are rotating? I don't know  if all of you guys can see this. But as we're going around?\u000a  Stop there.\u000a  It's not moving?  So, since it's not moving, now the Northern is  kind of like facing away, and the Southern is facing towards the Sun now?\u000a  Keep going. And then just make sure that the camera can see what you're talking about as you go around. Okay. So, did everybody see that? Who doesn't understand that? Who didn't understand what she did right there? Okay. So...\u000a  Now, I don't understand, actually, wouldn't it actually have to stop rotating and then it would have to rotate on its axis, and then start rotating again?\u000a  I'm not sure what you mean by that.\u000a Like... you spun it like this,\u000a  All right?\u000a  But the Earth is going like this the whole time. Would that end up stopping, and then it go like this? Or is that still happening?\u000a  It's not turning like that. It's just rotating around the Sun.\u000a  Wait, Sabrina, you had something to say. Okay. So, here's what's happening. Lucas is a little confused about your explanation, okay? So, we just have to go through it again. What did you have to say, Sabrina?\u000a  The earth doesn't change its tilt. It stays like an exact same position, but when it goes around the Sun, it gets like different ways, like the Sun hits it in different directions which causes different weathers.\u000a  Okay, wait, why don't you try to show him? Maybe it's just a different person. Maybe it will help explain it, okay? So, the more people we can get information out of, remember, the more we're gonna understand. So, start and tell us what's happening. And just make sure the camera can see what you're doing.\u000a  The Northern Hemisphere is towards the Sun, and the Southern is facing away. So, this causes colder weather, and up here where it's facing the Sun causes warmer weather. So, when it goes around the weathers start to change and then when you get it around here, the Southern is facing towards.\u000a  Wait, is the Southern facing towards?\u000a  The Southern's facing towards the Sun. And the winter is facing away. Which causes it to be warmer down here and Winter up here.\u000a  Who can help her out, because...\u000a  What I don't understand, is...\u000a  Go ahead, go ahead.\u000a  I don't understand it because it's still changing from day to night, but then it's shifting so wouldn't it have to stop spinning and then shift?\u000a If it stops spinning we're gonna die.\u000a \u000a  Not necessarily.\u000a  Okay, wait, Ben, start from the beginning and explain what's going on. Nick is our Sun still. Put your legs in so he doesn't trip. Northern Hemisphere is towards the Sun, Southern's away. And it's still spinning,  it doesn't change...\u000a  Okay. And so stop there and what's happening?\u000a  The Southern Hemisphere's towards the Sun and the Northern's away from it.\u000a  And what happened to the tilt the whole time?\u000a  It didn't change.\u000a  It what?\u000a  It didn't change.\u000a  It didn't change, it stayed the same.\u000a  But that made more sense. Like, I couldn't figure out why it wasn't spinning, but now I do.\u000a  And then it keeps going. And then it just goes back.\u000a  Now I understand.\u000a  Okay. Let's use this model, and try to figure out, where are the seasons happening? So, where do we live, Anna?\u000a  We live... Yeah, where he's pointing.\u000a  What's that called, somebody?\u000a  America.\u000a \u000a  North America.\u000a  North America, let's get bigger.\u000a  Northern Hemisphere?\u000a  What Byers?\u000a  The Northern Hemisphere.\u000a  Okay, so we live in the Northern Hemisphere. Right now, what's happening?\u000a  It's Summer.\u000a  It's Summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Does everyone see that?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Yes. Anybody not see it's Summer in the Northern Hemisphere, see it?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay, so...\u000a

V \u000a  So how would you describe that?\u000a\u000a  Can you find the exact  spot where that is in the text where you can find those? So you basically have found two character traits to describe to me, right? You guys have discovered that he can be what? What was one of them again?\u000a  Jealous. Sad.\u000a  Jealous. Or sad. So I want you to find that evidence. If you want to make those claims, any of those are great ideas. But now you have to dig a little bit deeper into the text and see if you can find this. Can you find examples and see? OK. Keep sharing. You're doing a great job!\u000a  Toby wanted to play...\u000a  Because Toby was kinda jealous because Bouncer was outside by himself. Didn't want to . Nobody didn't... and a little kid wanted to go outside the house. Well, I think he's thinking this himself. Because he was thinking about what the other .\u000a  That's Toby.\u000a  So, he's kinda jealous because he's talking to the other little dog, and every single time, he wants to play ball with him. But he doesn't want to .\u000a  And the thing is, the lady said it, in the story, it made it sadder than it usually would be sad. That sometimes the stories make it seem so sad, so good that that can feel. So, here where it says, "Why does Andy need a new dog?" Oh, wait. "'Why does Andy need a new dog?' wondered Toby. "He already has me. "Toby sighed and laid down "Beside the dog. "Maybe Andy doesn't love me anymore." They had to make it so that what happened, and actually it's sad what happened. It's not that it's sad, but it's not so so sad, but they make it like sad.\u000a  Toby wanted... \u000a  Toby wanted to play ball and he got a new dog and forgot, I was about to... \u000a  Well, he didn't really forget about Toby, because he still bought Toby his food. I know! Toby wanted to play ball, but when Andy came, he got a new dog. And then, for the rest of the day, Andy was playing with his new dog. And Toby felt left out. I say we put 'left out' somewhere.\u000a  He's so sad, jealous, and left out.\u000a  So, Toby wanted to play ball with Andy, but when Andy...\u000a  How do you spell Andy?\u000a  A-N-D-Y\u000a  Andy.\u000a  Andy.\u000a  Where do you see?\u000a  Oh, yeah.\u000a  When Andy told him he wanted to play ball,\u000a  Where are you?\u000a  Andy.\u000a  Andy.\u000a  Toby wanted to play ball, but when Andy came, he had a new dog. And you spelled with a silent \u000a  I think with the Andy...\u000a  Another dog?\u000a  A new... Like this one.\u000a  Another dog.\u000a  No, it's not. Well, whatever. Who wants to...  \u000a  Just write. Just write!\u000a  I put 'Toby was jealous because of Bouncer.' Maybe we can put, because he wanted more attention.\u000a  That's how my sister is. She wants more attention.\u000a  We're not talking about your sister. We're talking about Toby.\u000a  So, Toby was jealous...\u000a  Toby was jealous because a dog's there.\u000a  Because Toby was a dog and Bouncer just came along and he didn't like him. He's jealous.\u000a  No. We have to write a reason why he's jealous.\u000a  I know! Then we have to do part of the test. Part of the test!\u000a  Did you guys agree on a character trait that he was at the beginning?\u000a  Jealous.\u000a  Jealous.\u000a  Jealous? Do you have at least one example, and maybe two? Do you have an example, Joaquin?\u000a  I'm going to put Toby wanted more attention, but Bouncer got more attention.\u000a  Do you have an example  of why he wanted more attention?\u000a  I have one.\u000a  Can you find it, Oscar?\u000a  When he was, like, maybe Bouncer doesn't love him anymore.\u000a  I only said that. Can you find that? So when you write it, when you explain it, can you find that part and maybe quote it?\u000a  There's another reason... When they came through the driveway, he got all . And then when he came back, he lay... \u000a  So that's like too many things.\u000a  Toby was jealous, cuz\u000a  Toby was jealous, cuz Bouncer got more attention, instead of Toby.\u000a  No.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Oh, right here.\u000a  In the middle.\u000a  Toby, since nobody...\u000a  What paragraph is that?\u000a  Paragraph nine. He wondered if Andy had forgotten all about him.\u000a  Do you know why he paid more attention to Bouncer? Because he's a little puppy. And little puppies need more attention than big puppies.\u000a  Because little puppies don't know what to do.\u000a  I know. And they're not even trained. They have to train them more.\u000a  For like three months.\u000a  Yes. That's why he needs more attention than Bouncer, yeah.\u000a  Toby needed... Because Toby really knows how to...\u000a  And he knows, that's an old dog. And you can see all the wrinkles.\u000a  That's how the dogs are. Yeah, those dogs have wrinkles when they're big already. But they're still young.\u000a  OK.\u000a  Toby was jealous because Bouncer...\u000a  What did you write?\u000a  So. I have, 'In the beginning was Toby..." \u000a  When Andy had a puppy, he liked Bouncer more than Toby.\u000a  Maybe.\u000a  And in the beginning, Andy was showing the puppy opening. Opening the puppy, and showing it to Toby.\u000a  Yes.\u000a  That's how he was like nervous.\u000a  Jealous.\u000a  Yeah, jealous.\u000a  And selfish.\u000a  Yeah. That's what I put in the beginning. And then Toby... Remember the part when he got the little ball?\u000a  Right\u000a  Yeah, and he was being jealous.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  ...Bouncer. Because he was a new one. And the old one was Toby.\u000a  And the part when Andy closed the door in Toby's face, and he let him outside. Then he felt loner.\u000a  I believe that, Toby was getting  Bouncer. Because they would stay together, and they slept the whole night together.\u000a  So they were being friendly.\u000a  Yeah, like starting to.\u000a  Yeah.  Another thing that Bouncer was new. And another thing, Toby was old. So, Andy was used to Bouncer...\u000a  And Bouncer and Toby... \u000a  And that's I think what Toby about. It's Bouncer. You know how the fence went to  Bouncer. They get a kinda middle-something.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  That's what I think.\u000a  When they started to get  , Toby showed Bouncer how to catch the ball, that's when they started to become friends.\u000a,  And the climax is when  Andy he throw the rubber ball and told Bouncer to go and fetch it but he just sit there  and then yeah, Then Andy called Toby to go and show him how  to pitch the ball\u000a  Okay\u000a   \u000a  Oh, almost part of the end is when the puppy that is Bouncer becomes crying and then Andy took the puppy to Toby\u000a  Yeah, in the beginning I was getting like selfish. \u000a  May I interrupt for a second, so you guys it looks like you've developed the beginning pretty well and you found examples, right? Have you talked about the ending yet?, and how he was at the end? I see you're on the back page. How does Toby change at the end? Have you guys talked about that part yet? What's his character trait at the end of the story?\u000a  We talked about the--\u000a  Okay, so who was working on that part? Was somebody working on that part? Yeah, was there a trait that you picked for him, at the end?\u000a  When... the little puppy Bouncer started crying and Andy took the little puppy Bouncer when Toby \u000a  How did Toby change then? How do we describe Toby then?\u000a  Happy\u000a  Happy?, yeah can you give an example of now that he's happy? He's happy why?\u000a  Because he just  thinks anymore that \u000a  Ohhh. Can you come up with another reason, maybe together if you guys can look for another example as to why at the end of the story Toby is happy? Can you look and see if you can find one?\u000a  I think that Toby,  in the ending is kind\u000a  Is kind? Okay, can you come up with an example and share it with them in the scene? And then maybe you guys can come up with a consensus on one that you agree? Or you can write two different things, right? You don't all have to write the same thing. One of you can write he's kind and one of you can write he's happy as long as you have what?  as long as you have what?\u000a  Your reason.\u000a  Your reason, absolutely. So share that other example. Share that other example, too.\u000a  I think I've got he's kind. Maybe because he's going to be kind to Bouncer because he's still like a little puppy and he doesn't know how to do stuff. I think.\u000a  Yeah, in the end when he said   for me at the end he was getting kind of happy because... Andy told Bouncer to-- Andy told Toby to to get the yellow ball. You know the yellow ball.\u000a  Yeah\u000a  And Bouncer was  kind of tired and everything. because he's-- he's small and Toby, he catched it and they were playing, yeah, and they were getting happy and Toby in the end at that part he was used to liking Bouncer now.\u000a  Mm-hm\u000a  At the climax--\u000a  At the climax, it was when   It was when Toby... When Andy told Toby to show Bouncer how to fetch the ball and then started fetching the ball   and then he started to play and Bouncer and Bouncer danced on his bed Bouncer tried\u000a  Okay \u000a

V Get out your journal, I'll read it aloud and I'll put the time on the timer. Get our your journal. We're looking at journal entry number 14. And you're not allowed to write I don't know, take a guess if you're not sure, but don't write I don't know. So question 14 is very simple. Why do you think an earthquake happens? You can write it, you can draw a picture. So I'm asking you why do you think an earthquake happens. You have three minutes right now to write what you think. Why do you think an earthquake happens?  Why do you think an earthquake happens, and why do you think...  Remember there's no right or wrong, it's what you think is the answer. Remember you can draw a picture if that helps you. Okay if you want to draw  alright you've got like a minute left so you can draw a picture. Write down what you think.  I'm gonna give you about 30 more seconds. Many of you are still writing and that's fine, but I thought before we talk about this let's take a look at a little clip because I realize maybe not everybody has experience with an earthquake. So this one's kinda cool. It was shot obviously on somebody's iPhone so it's not the best quality, but many of you know that Japan has lots of earthquakes all the time, they're very used to earthquakes. So this person lives in Japan, and so again they're used to earthquakes, right? So they weren't like panicking so he actually took his iPhone and filmed the ground. So I want you to take a look. We're only gonna look at about a minute of it, but I want you to notice how the ground is moving, okay? And we're gonna use that idea to talk about why earthquakes happen. So this is pretty cool. So this was back in March 2011. So notice.  Now they're gonna go to another part. Notice the ground in the back, watch the back. You'll see something happen.  Watch what's happening.  Alright so that's real, it's not like there was a machine underneath there doing that. So you guys, we can solve what's happening, so let's take that and let's talk about this through. Why do you think an earthquake happens? Why do you guys think an earthquake happens? And remember, when we talk we're gonna let one person go at a time and we're gonna make sure we talk loudly so that we can hear. Alright so let's just start on this side. We're gonna work this way, Tony, what did you write? Why do you think an earthquake happens?\u000a Well, I think there's something wrong with the mantle that's coming out through the crust and makes it vibrate the earth and causing an earthquake?\u000a Okay, something to do with the mantle causes the earth to vibrate? Also I liked how you used a complete sentence. So remember, if you're not sure, there's some sentence starters up there. Jheyline, what did you write?\u000a I think earthquakes happen because two plate boundaries overlap each other.\u000a Excellent, because plate boundaries overlap each other. Jose.\u000a  I think that earthquakes happen when plates crash.\u000a When plates crash.\u000a  Together.\u000a Anybody else? Adrian, and then Dajana.\u000a I think that earthquakes happen because plates slide.\u000a Because plates slide, excellent. Dajana?\u000a I think an earthquake happens from too much stress?  Also, I think the plate boundaries overlap.\u000a Ooh, I like what you said, and that's exactly where I'm going next. So in that video clip you guys saw the ground move. I'm gonna give you 10 seconds. And that 10 seconds you're gonna share with the person next to you how did the ground move? What direction was that ground moving? So you have 10 seconds, share with your partner next to you or share with the people across from you. Go, 10 seconds.  Alright, finishing up in five, four, three, two, one, zero. Okay, so I heard lots of people talking so I'm gonna pull a name, this time, remember you can say what you said or what the person next to you said. So what kind of movement did you notice in that video clip? Let's see... . Now Neferly, what kind of movement did you see?\u000a  They were moving  apart?\u000a Good, moving apart, what else did you notice, Angel?\u000a  They were moving apart.\u000a Moving apart, what else did you notice, Dajana?\u000a Well, it was crashing everywhere, but I saw the... \u000a Ooh, kind of like water coming out of the sky? Josh, what else did you notice?  Oh, so a little bit of up and down movement? Alright so, up and down movement. Anybody else notice any other type of movement? So you guys said up and down, you said moving apart.  Oh, did you see how that piece literally slid?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Alright, so that's movement. You guys know some words for this. What are some words that we've learned to describe movement, and Dajana said a couple. What words, Jina?\u000a  Shearing.\u000a Yes, so there was some shearing happening. What else was happening? Rodolfo.\u000a  Tension?\u000a Yes, some tension pulling apart. And what else did you notice, Daniel?\u000a Compression?\u000a Yeah, compression, squeezing together. Okay, so we're getting this idea that, didn't Dajana, you said it was stress, or you said stress, Dajana right? So something about stress being kind of important. So we're gonna take that idea. Give us a moment, okay, thanks. Alright, so sorry about the interruption. So stress, Dajana was saying stress. So let me give you an example. So let's imagine that this rubber band is not a rubber band. Let's imagine that it's a rock. And let's imagine it's a rock, I know, it's a rubber band, but let's imagine it's a rock. So I'm gonna take, I'm gonna go like this, it's a rock, remember? So I'm doing this to the rock, and then I'm gonna stand here for an entire year, and then a year from now I'm gonna put my hands further apart. And then another year, I'm gonna put my hands further apart. What's happening to this rock, or this rubber band? What's happening to this rock over time? What's happening, Lupita, to this rock?\u000a  It's stretching.\u000a It's stretching, what else? Add to that, Tucker.\u000a   and stretching it out, stretch is added to it?\u000a Stress is added too, nice, Victor?\u000a  So maybe it's getting a little compression.\u000a Okay, maybe a little compression too. My hands are getting tired, Tony?\u000a Continental drift?\u000a Ooh, like okay, so if there were other pieces like my hands were Africa and South America, they'd be moving apart. Ernesto?\u000a  Thinner in the middle?\u000a Thinner in the middle. Sakura?\u000a  Tension.\u000a So tension, now I'm gonna stop because my hands starting to hurt, but what would happen if I kept doing that? I'm gonna have you take 10 seconds to talk to the person next to you. What might happen if I kept doing that, and I kept doing that, and I kept doing that? What might happen to this rubber band, or this rock? So 10 seconds, to the person next to you, ten seconds.  Alright, finishing up in five, four, three, two, one, zero. Okay, I heard lots of good discussion. So if I kept doing this, I kept doing it, I kept doing it, Moses, what might happen?\u000a  It might crack and break.\u000a It might crack and break. Everyone, what else maybe might happen? Victor?\u000a  It will scrape the mountain and it will create an earthquake and it'll break.\u000a Ooh, oh I like, 'cause you remember this a lot right? Little earthquake, excellent Tucker?\u000a It's just like when you shove your fingers, go all the way back it will break.\u000a Oh yeah, that would be painful. Jheyline?\u000a It'd probably explode from so much tension and stretch everything.\u000a Did everybody hear that word she just said? Which word did you say, it would?\u000a Explode.\u000a Explode, wow. That's a big, powerful word, but that's pretty equal to what happened, right? Big amount of power.\u000a Or like when you were doing that with the rock, like when you were moving it, like it would get more thinner and get more, it would kinda get wider when after all while it's still going it's gonna like .\u000a Good, so let's step back a little bit. So who was it, someone had said earthquake, right? You had said earthquake. So it's sounding like, what if that happens first? So before the earth actually moves, before what we saw in the video, what did you guys think was happening? And Moses had used the word for it too. What was happening to the rocks over time? So over time what was happening in that rock that would eventually lead to an earthquake? What's happening over time? Ernesto, what's happening over time?\u000a It's stretching?\u000a It's stretching, keep going with that, Diego?\u000a  It was standing.\u000a It was standing, Tony?\u000a  It's spreading apart?\u000a Spreading apart, Jheyline?\u000a  Widening?\u000a Widening, Tiger?\u000a Breaking?\u000a Breaking, so wait before the breaking though, you guys were saying it was stretching, it was pulling, so what word can you describe it building up in here, building up, Stephanie?\u000a  Through stress?\u000a Ah, okay, so it sounds like if we're gonna make an earthquake we need to have stress first. We have said stress that builds, right? Stress builds, and then what's gonna happen when the stress builds, and it builds, and it builds and it builds and it can't take it anymore? What's going to happen, Manuel?\u000a Collide?\u000a This is stress, keep going. Not collide, what's another word that's kind of, same idea? So you said it when I was over here. It's gonna keep stressing, and stressing, and what's gonna happen to the rock?\u000a Rip?\u000a It'll what?\u000a Rip?\u000a Rip, what's another word you can say.\u000a It'll explode.\u000a Explode, Adrian?\u000a Break?\u000a Break, great, so there's going to be a rupture. Or a break. And then is that it? End of the story? Nice day, that's it? Where does all this energy go, right? There's all this energy building up, where does it go? Yeah it ruptures, it breaks, and then is it over?\u000a No.\u000a No, what, where, what happened? Where did the energy go? Where did that energy go? Irma, where'd it go?\u000a  Plate tectonics?\u000a Yeah, it has to do with plate tectonics, absolutely. Where did that energy go? Where did it go, Rodolfo?\u000a  Plate boundaries?\u000a  Yeah, plate boundaries. So okay we got stress builds, ruptures, it breaks, and then is that it?\u000a No.\u000a That's the earthquake? What action? Yeah, Anna.\u000a It becomes an earthquake?\u000a Yeah, it becomes an earthquake and so what do we experience? Jheyline?\u000a Shaking?\u000a Shaking, oh! So it sounds like there's a rupture or a break, and then that's gonna lead to shaking and that shaking is actually what being released?\u000a An earthquake.\u000a It's an earthquake, yes and what is that shaking actually being released? So the shaking is released, what? Victor?\u000a All the stress?\u000a Yes, it's releasing all the stress. What's another word you could say? Releasing all of its...?\u000a Power.\u000a Power is a good word, or, Diego?\u000a  Energy.\u000a Energy, right? So it seems like all an earthquake is, is stress building up, building up, building up, breaks, and then we feel that. What do we experience the energy as? So what do we experience, think of the energy as? What do we experience it, as an energy? \u000a That?\u000a That, what's that? \u000a Shaking.\u000a Shaking, right? Alright awesome. So now we're gonna, you guys did that perfectly. So we're gonna write that down in our notes.\u000a  Woah.\u000a I know, that, earthquakes release energy, right? So that's what happens as a result. So we are not in any way done with this, because we are gonna talk all about different . You guys have made a good start on what's happening. So we are gonna take two notes today. They're pretty short. I'm sorry, the first one's a little long. The other one's super short. But this is what you guys were just telling me except now we're gonna add the word elastic strain, which is what you guys were telling me. You were telling me that energy was building up, you were telling me stress was building up, and that's gonna cause elastic strain. Yes, Dajana?\u000a The pictures that you showed us .\u000a What?\u000a It only cut through the .\u000a Kind of, yeah.\u000a Yes.\u000a So like maybe 'cause on the bottom that came out of the ground .\u000a Yeah.\u000a And then it just spilled it over, then it came out of the ground.\u000a Yeah, so thank you for those of you who got started. Rodolfo, let me just read this off for people. So our first topic today is earthquake energy. And this is what we just talked about. But now we're getting a chance to write it down and we're adding in a bigger word. And that word is elastic strain. So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape. So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape. Okay, so that's step one in an earthquake. Step two. Energy is released when the rock ruptures or breaks. So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape and energy is released when the rock ruptures or it breaks and released energy travels in seismic waves, and we will learn all about those next week. But you can still write down, you just think released energy travels and it's felt as shaking.\u000a

V The corners.\u000a  The corners, that's fine. How do you get exactly one painted face? Which one of these have just one color on them?\u000a The middle.\u000a  Yeah just the ones in the middle on each face. And how many of them are there?\u000a Six.\u000a  So that's 6 out of 27. So that's fine. And realize that if you did it right, those are all your options. Each of these cubes has either zero colors, up to three colors. Nothing has four colors. So that means all your probabilities should add up to what?\u000a  27.\u000a 27 out of 27. Does it?\u000a  No.\u000a No, so what's the issue? One of these numbers at least has to be off. So figure out which one that is. See if you could figure what one. So keep in mind, these look right. But realize, these are all probabilities because you're picking them out of that hat. So, these should all be out of...\u000a  27.\u000a Right, because there's 27 cubes you're picking from.\u000a  Right.\u000a And if you did it right and these are all the cubes, then they should add up to what?\u000a  27.\u000a Right, does it?\u000a  Yeah it does.\u000a 27, okay so fine. Good. So when you do the next one it should all be out of...\u000a We can figure that out.\u000a You can figure that out.\u000a  Isn't it 16 times 4 so 64?\u000a So where are you getting these numbers from?\u000a  My mind.\u000a Okay, so I get no painted faces. There's just the one cube that's right in the middle. So that's one out of... Because you're picking them out. 1 out of 27. You gotta do a probability, right. But then how many have one painted face? How'd you get six? Which six?\u000a The middle ones.\u000a Sure, the middle ones. And there's six faces so it makes sense, 6 out of 27. How do you get three painted faces?\u000a  I didn't do that one.\u000a Okay. The corners. So that should be eight. And then realize if you did this right, it should all at up to what?\u000a  27.\u000a 27 out of 27. So how do you figure out how many have two painted faces?\u000a Just add these together and subtract them.\u000a Yeah you could do that. Now, there is a pattern to the two, just like the other ones. But you can also subtract and figure that out. So, yeah, good. Oh that brings up a good point. Everybody, for your first cube... For your very first cube everything should be out of what number?\u000a  27.\u000a 27. All your probabilities should be out of 27. Is it possible you can reduce the fractions, when you figure it out?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Yes, I'm gonna tell you, don't reduce them. Leave it out of 27. Even if it's 3 out of 27, don't reduce it to one ninth. Just leave it at 3 out of 27, it'll help you down the line. So those look good. And you know-- One of the ways you could check if you did this right, is all four of these should add up to what?\u000a  27.\u000a 27. And does it?\u000a Yeah.\u000a It adds up to 27 out of 27. So you got all your bases covered. So that's good. Okay, good keep going. How many have no painted faces?\u000a Four.\u000a Why four, which four?\u000a The four is right over here inside, and then there's four.\u000a Okay but let me ask you this, there's these four. But you said go inside a layer. And then you're right there's four underneath. But then there's another layer underneath that.\u000a So there's eight.\u000a So there should be eight. And one of the ways you know you're right about this, besides just hoping that you're thinking about it the right way. How do you know there's three painted faces? Which eight are you talking about?\u000a  The corners.\u000a The corners. So you know you're right with the eight, but these should all add up to what? And they do, so you're okay. Okay, good. So keep going and you're good, it's all out of 64. So that's a good start.\u000a  Will this still have one painted face?\u000a Well there is a pattern to it, just like the other ones. But it's fine if you can't figure that out yet. Just keep going, you've got the right number. So see if you can figure it out now for the 4x4x4. How are we doing on the front side? Everything good? So let me ask you this about this stuff. I assume you all have the same answers.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a So, you said one painted face, there's six of them. Which six? Just one color painted. Sure the center of each of the six faces. And there's six faces, so six times one is six. That's fine. No, we got 8 out of 27 for three. Because which ones are you looking at? The corners. No painted faces, there's just one in the middle. If you added all these up, what should they equal?  But what does it equal up to? Not 27. So, what's the issue? What's the deal there?\u000a  No idea.\u000a Where is there something going wrong? Because you know that one has to be eight. You know there's exactly one because it's the center one in each of the six sides. So, you know that has to be six. The issue is with the two painted faces. It's not eight. Now, you can figure it out by subtracting, and just figuring out what adds up to 27. Or you could go back and just look at those, how many of those have the two painted faces. Where are you getting eight from? Which cubes here have two painted faces?\u000a These ones.\u000a So that's four on this front side.\u000a There's four on the back side.\u000a That's eight.\u000a Two on this side, 10, 12.\u000a 12. Does that make sense? And that adds up to 27 then, when you add all those up. So now do the same thing for the one out of 64. Okay. Good. How we doing?\u000a These should add up to 64 shouldn't they?\u000a They should add up to 64. How do you get no painted faces? How do you get the four with no painted faces?\u000a  The center pieces.\u000a So, over here, let's say these four in the middle. But you're not looking at those. Those have one painted face, but you look a layer below that. And that's four right there. But you can go a layer below that. So that should be eight. So does that mess up something else? I don't know how you got the other numbers.\u000a So the equation for this, it'd be distance... divided by two to get three.\u000a Does that work up here? You're on the right track. You're thinking the right way.\u000a Minus two.\u000a Does that work? I mean, once you get this, I would try to do a 5x5x5 cube. Even though, I didn't write it down there. See if it holds up.\u000a Yeah, because there'd be 27 in the middle.\u000a That seems to make sense. And that'll help you on the back side when you get there. So these look fine. Let's talk about this one for a second. If you add these up, you have 24, 24, 18, 4. If you add all those up what do you get?  Do you?\u000a 60.\u000a  60. Right now you have 60 out of 64. So there's four squares you haven't counted yet. Where did they go? And you kinda know you're right with the three colored cubes because you know which ones they are. Which ones are those?\u000a So would we add it to the non painted faces?\u000a Why? You can't randomly-- What's the pattern? Which ones have no painted faces?\u000a The ones on the top.\u000a So basically, you have these four right here, but a layer below, right? But there's also another layer below that.\u000a Oh so it's eight.\u000a So that's where there's eight. Does that make sense?\u000a Oh yeah, I see that.\u000a So that's where that's coming from. So now it adds up to 64. It looks like you're probably good. Why don't you try doing it for a 5x5x5 cube before you go to the back side, so at least you have some patterns you can detect. It'll make the back side easier. But it should be a breeze now to get the 5x5x5 cube. Wow, Chris. You're on a roll. Smart idea, making a graph. And that should be eight over what?  Over here how many squares do we have?\u000a We have 27.\u000a And you got that because it's...\u000a Three cubed.\u000a  Three cubed. And the other one is four cubed. If you do the 5x5x5, it would be five cubed. So if you have an nxnxn, what is that? n cubed. So everything should be out of n cubed on the back. And you're right that it's eight out of n cube for the three painted. Why don't you try the no painted? That's probably the next one to get.\u000a  But what, there's the one middle.\u000a How do you figure that out? And this is where you gotta go back and look at the pattern you got for no painted faces. How did you figure that out? And maybe the numbers help, but maybe just look at the picture and figure out, how did we know how many had no painted faces?\u000a  Right.\u000a What do those numbers have in common?\u000a  Okay.\u000a How we doing? Well you're definitely right with eight over n cubed. That makes sense, right? Because always the corners in the cube. It's always the same. How did you get 6n here? And you got it over here. You guys have 6n in different places.\u000a Well see, I thought I got a brain blast.\u000a What?\u000a But it didn't work out. I mean, I felt really smart for two seconds. But I was thinking that, since there's six sides, it has to be six times something.\u000a Okay. Okay, that's not a bad way to think. You know the answer here was 12.\u000a Yeah.\u000a That was with the 3x3x3 cube. Does that work? If n is three, you would get 18. But that's not what you got on the front side. So there's some discrepancy.\u000a Okay.\u000a But that's not a bad way to think. Some of these things have to do with six faces. Like, there's some multiplying by six involved. You know the corner ones are gonna be eight no matter what. That has nothing to do with six faces.\u000a Right.\u000a Right, that's just the corners.\u000a  How do you do this?\u000a Go back a second. Sorry, a lot of flipping. You feel confident about these two sets of numbers?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a So why don't you try doing it 5x5x5 cube, even though I didn't ask for it. But see what numbers you get for that because it'll make the back page a little better. Because now you'll have more numbers to use and try to find a pattern. You guys have different numbers. Why is that?\u000a  What do you mean?\u000a On the front side.\u000a  What do you mean?\u000a Sarah has 8 out of 64 here. You have 4 out of 64 here.\u000a  Oh blood.\u000a Oh my god. Do you need to go? Go, go. Go to the bathroom.\u000a  I don't care.\u000a I care, go.\u000a  Do you have band-aids now?\u000a I don't know. I don't think I do. Go to the bathroom. Things still happen. So you have eight out of eight cubed. That's fine... We know the three painted faces are going to be which ones? The corners.\u000a The corners. And there's always gonna be eight. So that's fine. Eight out of n cubed. How do you figure out how many have zero painted faces?\u000a It's always the ones in the middle.\u000a Yes, always the ones in the middle. So when you had a 3x3x3 cube, what was in the middle?\u000a One.\u000a And what's the dimensions of that cube? 1x1x1. When it was a 4x4x4 cube, what were the dimensions of the middle? That you couldn't see.\u000a 4x4x4.\u000a Well 4x4x4 is the whole cube.\u000a 2x2x2.\u000a  2x2x2. If it was a 5x5x5 cube what would be the middle?\u000a 3x3x3.\u000a  3x3x3. If its an nxnxn cube, what's the middle? You kinda have it. If it's 6x6x6, what's the middle?\u000a  I don't know. I'm kinda lost.\u000a Okay go back for a second. You lost me at the 5x5x5 one.\u000a Okay, you know its 3x3x3. And the center was 1x1x1. That's the ones you couldn't see any color. 4x4x4 cube, what's the center?\u000a  2x2x2.\u000a If it's a 5x5x5 cube, let's say. What would the center be?\u000a  3x3x3.\u000a 3x3x3. If it's a 6x6x6 cube?\u000a  4x4x4.\u000a If it's an nxnxn cube?\u000a  n minus two.\u000a Times n minus two times n minus two. So what's the pattern for no painted faces?\u000a  n minus two cubed.\u000a Exactly. That's the sort of pattern you need to find for those first two now. How are you figuring these out when you actually have a concrete 5x5x5 cube?\u000a Is this what you're supposed to do? Because it's saying that n is the number of small cubes, so you can't just say it's a 4x4x4. n is representing the whole 125 cubes right?\u000a Right.\u000a So is this the correct equation for one painted sides?\u000a For one painted side?\u000a Yeah.\u000a For one painted side. Well, how are you finding the one painted face? Or how many painted cubes did you have here?\u000a I had six.\u000a Six, which six? It's basically the one in the center, but there's six faces so we multiplied by six. So, I get where this is coming from. The multiply by six.\u000a So n represents the 125.\u000a n represents how many across you have.\u000a Oh. I thought n represented the whole--\u000a No, I mean.\u000a

V What I'm going to do is we are going to use these projects to help students at our school. Mrs. Ess's class is not the only class that has had problems with students accidentally plagiarizing. And that was the original reason that you guys came here today: because somebody in another class had plagiarized something accidentally in Mrs. Ess's class. Your projects today are going to be used in other classrooms. So we're going to have a contest. We're going to pick the 5 best Powerpoints, and we're going to send them out to other classrooms to help students learn why they shouldn't plagiarize. Now some of you are already experts at Powerpoint. We're not learning how to do Powerpoint right now. A lot of you already know how to summarize because you learned to summarize in Mrs. Ess's class. So you have that experience. There was a disconnect where you didn't put the two together. So what we're doing right now is we're saying, okay, I know how to summarize; now I know how to avoid plagiarism. So let's start working right now. You have your rubric. Look at your rubric. If you have a question, raise your hand and I'll come and explain it. And we're going to start right this very second. So go ahead and get into Powerpoint, and do your powerpoint. If you're going to be doing something different, like making a newspaper, a brochure, or maybe a podcast then you're going to start working on that. And I am just going to walk around you guys. Our focus is plagiarism, and the way we avoid plagiarism is through focusing on summarizing. So you can refer back to your notes. Remember you used your Cornell notes the other day when you were here and we went online, and you took a summarization quiz and tutoring session? I'll be right there in a second. Yes? I'm sorry?  Okay, David? Yes, yes absolutely.  I'm sorry, I'll be back to you in a moment. Yes?\u000a \u000a I think that would be a great idea. We're focusing on plagiarism and we've learned about how summarization is one of the ways to avoid it. Right? Okay. I'm sorry. Sure. Very good. Oh, great, you're back up. Okay, tissues are behind the globe. Can you go get one for me? Okay, have you been helped? You have to know how to spell it. Right over there on the board.  How's it going Cathy?\u000a Pretty much.\u000a Take off the S. I like that though. It was good. You need some help Mr. Phillip?\u000a No thank you.\u000a You're fine? What you're doing is looking through here at all the requirements. So when you use your creativity to put this together, And I, yes?\u000a what does this word mean?\u000a Okay. So, multimedia basically means that it could be either Powerpoint or a podcast. So you need all of these to get the highest grade. So if you come up with something additional, you're going to get a higher grade. This part you did here is basically your method of memorization which would be number 3. How is it going?\u000a Pretty good.\u000a Now remember if you're taking a definition of plagiarism from a website, then you really need to say where you got that. There's a way of doing that. You're going to state where you got that, and when it was, yes?\u000a \u000a That's okay. You're going to use your own words. It's interesting how different all of these look. Yes, you can. You definitely can. I also have some books available. They're hiding. You could, Eric, use this book too. I've got you marked right here. Would anyone else like a dictionary? You can get an online definition too. Okay I've got them marked. You can find it easily that way.\u000a Can we use our paper to take notes?\u000a Yes, of course you can. If that would help you, Cathy. Have you gotten to Powerpoint yet? No? Do you know how to do that? Oh, good. Okay, David. I'm sorry. I've got it in this book too.  Is that your second slide or your first slide?\u000a My first.\u000a Okay. Okay, like I said before, the purpose of doing this is to try to help other students in our school. And a lot of you already know ways of avoiding plagiarism. Maybe you were even aware that you were plagiarizing. And we've been focusing on summarizing. Of course, there's another way you can do it. Paraphrasing is a little bit harder, but we're focusing on summarizing. And besides summarizing, another thing that you can do, with summarizing, is still giving credit to where it came from. Yes? Hang on.\u000a,  Okay. What was this Animoto video telling us? Can someone raise their hand and... Yes, Brandy.\u000a  Telling you not to plagiarize.\u000a  Telling you not to plagiarize. Very good. So, if that's what you were thinking, you are thinking about what we're going to talk about today, which is plagiarism. Now, I'm going to go on the internet right now and we're going to look at the definition of plagiarism. Well, actually, we're going to look at the definition for plagiarize, which is "to steal and pass-off as your own." So, you can think of internet plagiarism as equal to...\u000a  Cheating.\u000a  Cheating, and that is considered...\u000a  Academic misconduct.\u000a  Academic misconduct, and that's when you get in big trouble sometimes. Now, we're going to watch a TeacherTube video about plagiarism. So, you will be using your worksheet, and we're going to hear a story about this kid named Billy, and you've got some bubbles here. So, right here in the central box is what you're going to write down-- you're going to write in this box, and you can't write anything yet because nothing's happened so far, but you're going to write about what Billy did. And in the little circles right here you're going to write the causes, why it probably happened, and you're going to predict what happens to Billy. So, we're going to start right now so I want everybody to listen carefully. Here we go.\u000a  Mrs. Calstad\u000a  Hey Mr. Harris.\u000a I have to show you this research report by Billy. He did it on horses. It sounds really good. The pictures are good, too.\u000a Oh, I love horses, let me see it. Wow, Mr. Harris, this is really good.\u000a I told you it was.\u000a But you know what, it kind of sounds familiar. I've seen a lot of students looking at this website called allhorses.info, and I think it's some of this exact same information. I think we should check it out.\u000a Let's pull it up.\u000a Sure.\u000a Here's the website, Mr. Harris, and it says right here, "The horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries." What does Billy's report say?\u000a "The horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries."\u000a So, it's the exact same sentence? That's not good.\u000a That's not good. That's cheating.\u000a And look at that picture, too. It's the exact same photo.\u000a That is the exact same photo.\u000a Did Billy give credit to his sources anywhere on that page?\u000a No. I don't see it anywhere.\u000a No. Well, that's a pretty serious thing.\u000a I've heard of students in college being expelled for that.\u000a Really?\u000a Yes.\u000a I think they call it plagiarism when you copy someone else's work and don't give them credit, and that's a shame, because all Billy had to do was write down where he got his facts, and give some credit to that photo, too.\u000a How could he have written his report differently?\u000a Well, if you look at his first sentence, when it says "The horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries, " he just could've changed the words a little bit. Maybe he could have explained what domesticated means. I don't think that's a word that he would use a lot.\u000a I see what you mean.\u000a What could he have done with this picture though?\u000a Well, he could use this picture. If he took the picture himself, he wouldn't have to do anything, but if he did take it from this website, which it looks like he did, he'd just need to copy the web address down at the top, and that would be it. That way, he could give the photographer credit for that person's work.\u000a So, what you're saying is, it's okay to use facts from other sources, just put them in your own words.\u000a Correct.\u000a And, be sure to include, in your report, who wrote these facts.\u000a Exactly, and as far as the photos go, you can use a photo as long as you include the web address that's on your screen, and I think in library and psychology class you and I will work on that with students so everyone will know how they can properly give credit to their sources.\u000a We definitely will. That sounds good. Now we just need to talk to Billy about this.\u000a Sounds like a plan.\u000a Where is that Billy?\u000a  Okay, you have your work sheets. Let's start filling them out right now. Make sure your name's on your paper, and we won't take too long, we've got some extra time  as well. So, when you start writing, if you have a question, raise your hand. You're going to do the predicted cause and the predicted effects. Now, while you're filling these out, I'm also going to ask a question. I want to do a quick question. What do you think happened to Billy? Can somebody raise their hand and tell me? What do you think might happen to Billy?\u000a  He got in trouble with the teacher.\u000a  He probably got in trouble with the teacher. Anybody else?\u000a  Detention.\u000a  And possibly detention, yes.\u000a  Suspension.\u000a  Say it one more time.\u000a  A suspension.\u000a  Very good. Okay. Now, let's do a quick think pair share. Okay, what is the message of this video? So, talk to you neighbor. Let's think in a pair. Talk to your neighbor. The person sitting right next to you. Cassie, you work with Brandy. Brandy, you work with Santiago. Talk to your neighbor real quick. Your question is, what is the message of this video?  Okay, we're going to stop right now. Raise your hand if you can share, if you can share out right now. Yes.\u000a  He could use facts and research .\u000a  Very good. So, if he used facts and research information in his own words this wouldn't have happened. Yes.\u000a  He has to give credit to the original site, or the place he got it.\u000a  Very good. Thank you, Cassie, that was great. Okay. So, now we've done our video, and I just wanted to say that, as a sixth grader, I made a big mistake. Before they had the internet, I used an encyclopedia set and I copied stuff into my report, and I thought "Here's the information, " I didn't realize I was actually plagiarizing it because I didn't put it in my own words. So, now what we're going to do is, we're going to move over to our renaissance responders. So, right now, you're all logged in, and I am going to go over to that right now, and we have a survey. So, it's all re-programmed, and we're ready to go, and what we're going to do is, we're going to flip our paper to the back side, and you've got your questions right here. We're doing an anonymous survey to find out how you feel about plagiarism. So, I don't want you to feel that it's going to be something that I'm going to know your response to, because it really is going to be anonymous, and I want you to circle the answer that is the most popular response to the group. So, when you look up here, you're going to see a graph, and you're going to circle the answer that is the most popular and you're going to star the answer that is the second most popular. Okay. What is the level of plagiarism at our school? You have three choices, "students do not plagiarize very often," that's letter A; B, "about half of the students plagiarize;" C, "almost everyone plagiarizes." Go ahead and respond. Now, we're going to look at the graph, and we're waiting for everybody to respond right now, and I'm looking and I can see some people have responded and some people have not responded. On your paper, you will be circling the most popular response, and you're starring the second most popular response. Can somebody tell me what the most popular response is right now?\u000a  A.\u000a  A. Okay, and that was, "students don't plagiarize very often." That's good to know. So, go ahead and mark on your paper right now. A has a circle around it for number one, and our second most popular response actually is C and E, so both of those will get starred. I'm so sorry, did I say E? I meant C. I think that what happened is, somebody made a response in a column that they shouldn't have made a response in that column. So, they answered the wrong question. So, you did it the proper way. We're going to move on to our question number two.\u000a

V And I'm going to look at what number that is and I see that that is Now, your information that you get, we're going to be writing in our chart here. So do you see at the bottom of your page, it has ramp with one book, you're going to write the distance that your car moved. Now don't write 20 inches, 'cause yours is going to be different, okay? You write how far your car went for ramp number one. Okay? Hold on just a second Isabelle. Now, I gave you guys numbers. And the numbers are so that we all get a chance to do every part of this experiment. The number one person is going to set up the ramp. So they're going to put the dictionary and the ramp, get it all set up for the group. The number two person is going to get to hold the car, and let it go, okay? And then the number three person, is going to measure the distance that it went, okay? Close attention . Okay, so you're going to all have a job to do. Now this is with the one dictionary. When we do the experiment next, we're going to try it with two dictionaries and see how it changes, okay? But for right now, we're going to try just one dictionary. Are there any questions before we get started? Miguel.\u000a Like, the first one goes first, and then on the second thing, like you try to set the number one does the second job, and the second person does the number three and the number three does the number one job?\u000a Yes, so everyone is going to get a chance to do every single part of the experiment, okay? So we don't need to fight over who gets to do the car, and who can get that, okay? Isabelle, question?\u000a But what if we do the same, each of us what we do?\u000a Oh, if that's what you get, if you get 20 inches on yours, then you write that down, okay? Yes. Angie.\u000a When you took... \u000a No, we're all going to talk to each other in nice, friendly voices, that's right. Okay, Max, last question, and then we need to get started.\u000a Are we going to use the rulers?\u000a Yes, you're going to use the rulers. And I know I didn't give those to the groups, but I'm going to pass those out right now, okay? Can I have you guys please quietly walk with your papers and your pencil to your group? \u000a Who's going to set up the ramp?\u000a Me. \u000a Okay, you're number two. \u000a Start it in the corner? \u000a It's a meter. \u000a Come on over here. Okay, get your paper.\u000a No, but watch out!\u000a Don't do it!\u000a Awesome! \u000a Okay boys and girls, once you get to your group, you can go ahead and get started.\u000a It looks farther.\u000a And this group, you may use this ruler.\u000a Okay, measure it. One right here, and then here.\u000a Are you okay? \u000a No, from here.\u000a From there, there. No, Ms. Sprano said from here. Nine inches. No, 11,11, 11 inches.\u000a It looks like eight. Wait is, oh no it's eight. Remember what Ms. Sprano said?\u000a No, she said from the front.\u000a Actually, I said from the back. Good listening Miguel. So how far did the car go?\u000a Eight inches.\u000a Eight inches, okay, excellent. So write down your information. You've got a pencil right here. Okay so the next step, Isabelle, Miguel and Angie. Is you're going to try it with two dictionaries. Okay?\u000a But number three is going to set it up?\u000a Look up at the chart to see who's going to set it up.\u000a So, who's setting it up?\u000a Um, number two. \u000a Okay, let's figure it out. Okay, now go to your group for a second. Okay now, is this how far going to?\u000a Yea, 'till we go.\u000a Well wait a second, are we measuring from the top of the ramp, or are we measuring from the bottom? So, you're going to put the ruler right up next to the edge of the ramp, and then measure to the end of the car. So how far did that car go?\u000a Five.\u000a No, it's to the end of the car. So how far did the car go?\u000a Two.\u000a Two inches. Now, do you guys think that because you're on a thicker carpet, that's going to change your results?\u000a It should go up like that.\u000a Do you think that the thicker carpet is going to slow the car down and make it not go so far?\u000a Yes.\u000a Yeah? Would you guys like to move to that part of the carpet?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, you can move to that carpet, and see what the difference is. And you guys will have to share that with the class, okay? So try it again with just one dictionary, okay?\u000a So then one. \u000a Have to let the car go guys! \u000a We're going to try it with two dictionaries.\u000a Okay, so look at the chart to see who's going to set it up next.\u000a Oh my God, this is going to be loud.\u000a We're good Ms. Sprano!\u000a She said from the very back!\u000a You set it up. No, I mean, you let go.\u000a Who's turn is it? You're doing the first one. Who's number three? We all have jobs to do. Who's number one? Okay, so your job is to set up the ramp, which you did a good job on. Number two person, who's the number two person? So Giselle.\u000a I'm number three.\u000a No, she was two.\u000a It's fine, she's number three. So Giselle, you're going to let the car go, and look, Esmeralda is going to measure. Okay, so...  Excellent. Okay, now put that down. Now which side do we need to start with? Very good. And then we can spin it around there. So now you want to move it over so that you can measure at the end of the carpet. Can you scoot it over some? Very good, so how far did the car go? Seven inches, good. Okay, so let's write that down on our chart. Finish yours. Change this so it's seven inches. Okay, now what's our next step, what are we going to do next?\u000a I don't know.\u000a Are we going to try it with two dictionaries? Okay, so now, who's going to set that up? Looks like the number two person, so Giselle is going to go ahead and set up the dictionary, so put one more dictionary on top. Okay, good. Well, number three is going to let the car go. So now it's Esmeralda's turn. So you guys, what do you think is going to happen? Do you think it's going to go farther, or do you think it's going to be closer? When you let go of the car right now, what do you think is going to happen? You think it'll fall down? Okay, well let's see what happens. Woah, did you see how far that went? Okay, don't pick it. Now, wait a second, it's Edgar's turn to measure. So let's see, how far did it go Edgar? So we measure to the, 14. Wow, that went farther, didn't it? So your next step is going to be to do it with three dictionaries. Please go sit down in your group and raise your hand. Let's go sit down at our group. \u000a The car's there.\u000a 15 and a half!\u000a 15 and a half. \u000a 15 and a half. Who knows how to write 15 and a half? \u000a So number two would get to measure the distance on this one, okay?  Okay, so let me see how you're doing here. Okay, well can we try it again? Can we try it again? So, you're on the second experiment. So number three, who's the number three person?\u000a He is.\u000a Jose's the number three person? Okay, so Jose get's to let it go. Should we move this out of the way, or should we keep it here? So, are you number three?\u000a No, I'm number one, but number one set it up. But then see. Oh.\u000a Okay so, it looks like it's Jose's turn to let the car go. So hand the car--\u000a No, he sets up ramp.\u000a Can you go sit down please, and I'll be right with you.\u000a Got it.\u000a Okay Jose, try it. It's my car, put it right here and let's see what happens. Okay, let go. Excellent, okay who's measuring?\u000a Me.\u000a Okay, so let's measure. Now do we want it, are we measuring with inches or centimeters? No, it's right, we're doing it the right way. Don't worry.  Did it go farther, or was it closer?  Okay, so then I have a question for you guys, listen. If we put three dictionaries here, do you think it's going to go farther, or it's going to go closer?\u000a Farther.\u000a You think it's going to be farther? What do you think Jose?\u000a Farther.\u000a What do you think?\u000a Farther.\u000a Well okay, we better check it out. Did you write down your numbers? So for the second one it was 15 inches. Okay? Now, we're on the last part, that means the number three person sets up the ramp. Are you the number three person? So set up the ramp, where's your other dictionary? Okay, so then we have to use the dictionary, okay? Can you let go? Okay it's, oh wow that might be pretty cool, huh? Okay, so Devon it's your turn to let the car go.  And I like how you're moving all the stuff out of the way. Selena, you want to stay there, or do you want to move? Oh, okay. So who's turn is it to measure? Again?\u000a No, number one gets to.\u000a You know what, I think we mixed it up. Now, Selena lets go of the car. And Devon measures this time, okay?  Did you, okay, so maybe it's Jose's turn. Okay, go ahead.  Ooh, look how much it turned! Okay, so measure how far it went.  Okay, so measure how far it went, let's see what happened.\u000a Do we move the... \u000a 17.  Try it again, let's try it again. \u000a Okay, let's see, how are you guys doing? You got all yours finished? Okay, good. Okay, well I haven't gone over that.   Okay, boys and girls, raise your hand if your group had a chance to do all three experiments. All three. Okay.\u000a

V 5.03. \u000a 5.03. All right let's talk for a minute before you continue with your little test. First of all, let's talk about motion. What do you know about motion?\u000a Motion is the way that you get from one place to another. It's changing position.\u000a Changing position, so just now, Bailey was running, was he changing position?\u000a Yes.\u000a Yes, all right so how do we know that he was in motion? Like, when he is running toward me how do I know he's in motion? \u000a That stays there and you can see him coming up.\u000a Nobody else was moving around.\u000a So that's our frame of reference. He came over there so we know he's coming toward us. All right so you guys did a trial. How many times did you run, Bailey?\u000a Three.\u000a All right so what are we gonna do now?\u000a We're gonna have to add them all up and divide them by three.\u000a Why are we dividing by three?\u000a Because we did it three times.\u000a Okay, you did it three times. You're finding your average. What's another word for average?\u000a Mean.\u000a Mean, good. All right so let's find his mean or his average. And then we'll record that and double check to make sure the whole group has the same amount or the same number. Okay, what did you get?\u000a 5.21.\u000a 5.21, is that what everybody has? Nathan maybe you redo yours and just check since three people have that. Let's name some things that are in motion. What do you know that's in motion?\u000a The earth.\u000a The earth is in motion, yup. But I don't feel the earth move so how do I know it's in motion?\u000a 'Cause sun is the frame of reference.\u000a Okay, so if I was thinking of the sun which is what they do, and the earth we know we could see the earth is moving and the sun would be your frame of reference. What else do you know that moves?\u000a Animals.\u000a Animals.\u000a Insects.\u000a Cars.\u000a Insects, cars.\u000a Boats.\u000a People.\u000a People, books.\u000a Boats.\u000a Boats . All right so how are we gonna find our speed because now we know how many seconds it took him but what's something else that I need to know besides how long it took him?\u000a The distance.  The distance traveled which is a hundred feet.\u000a So what difference did we do?\u000a Hundred feet.\u000a A hundred feet. Okay, so what's the first thing you have to do is measure out your hundred feet?\u000a Yes.\u000a You did that and chalk-marked it? Good, all right so let's--\u000a We're talking about the average time taken.\u000a All right, so let's do that now.\u000a 19.\u000a So let's talk about what that means, 19.19.\u000a Feet per second.\u000a What's that mean? Feet per second.\u000a 19 feet per second.\u000a So if I say "feet per second" can you explain that to me? What does that mean "19 feet per second"?\u000a Every second I would go 19.19 feet.\u000a Good okay, so if I'm driving in my car and my car's going 70 miles per hour and I'm on the interstate do I say my car's going 75?\u000a No.\u000a No you'd say miles per hour, bleh, 70 miles per hour.\u000a Can you tell me, Nathan, why? What does that mean "70 miles per hour"?\u000a 70 miles per hour means you're going 70 miles per each hour.\u000a For every hour, so that's good to know for vacations, right? Especially when you have little kids who are saying, "Are we there yet?"  You gotta figure out how long it's gonna take you.\u000a Are we there yet?\u000a Right, okay. All right you're going to go into your next part and I'll be right back to check on you. Who's the next person?\u000a Jordan\u000a It's gonna be Jordan. All right, Miss Jordan.\u000a Hold the longest tape and put it down right here so it will stay up.\u000a He thinks he needs one more piece of tape.\u000a Ready? Ready. Set, go.  1.76.\u000a 1.89.\u000a Okay, so why don't you write them both. Do you have two spots?\u000a Only have one.\u000a You have two spots; write one there and one there. That's what you do there, just like that.\u000a What did you get?\u000a 1.89.\u000a 1.89.\u000a All right let's come talk about what you're doing. So let's get the three kinds of balloons that you're testing. Just gonna bring over here. Dan, why don't you get the, um, come slide that over here so we can get that tape off and get ready for the next one. We might try that one here. So we have...\u000a A big round one.\u000a A big round one, a green one, okay.\u000a A long one.\u000a Okay.\u000a And a birthday one.\u000a Did you all predict the same one would be the fastest or do you have different predictions?\u000a Different.\u000a Different predictions, what do you think?\u000a The Happy Birthday one.\u000a You think the Happy Birthday one.\u000a Long.\u000a Long.\u000a Long.\u000a Long.\u000a Can you tell me why you think Happy Birthday and then you'll tell me why you think long.\u000a At first my prediction was the long one because it was not as much wind blowing against it. But now there's wind blowing. It blew it to the sides and putting more force against it which slowed it down and made the long go faster.\u000a It'd be like this wind.\u000a Yes.\u000a You had this big. That is a pretty good prediction.  Why do you guys think it's gonna be the long one?\u000a I think it's the long one because it's more smaller and the air can come off faster and it's more stretchier.\u000a Stretchier.\u000a Tight, it's more tight.\u000a All right, all right we had some \u000a ...wasn't going all the way so we changed it to 20.\u000a It would stop about maybe three feet away from the end.\u000a It would stop, so what did you decide to do?\u000a We changed it to 20.\u000a You moved it to 20. Okay so... What else could you have done besides move it to 20?\u000a Blow up the balloon more.\u000a Maybe blow up the balloon more. Maybe the little one wouldn't have worked though, huh? It's not that much in there.\u000a We tried the big red one putting more air but it still stopped.\u000a The little one--\u000a I think the wind kind of changed how fast it would go and how far.\u000a All right, so... All right... So let's come back this way.\u000a Watch out behind you, Megan.\u000a Dan you can go over to... There's motion in the wind, huh?\u000a 176 and 108.\u000a All right, so here we go. What are you gonna do first? Let's do the round balloon first. That was nobody's prediction, right?\u000a Nope.\u000a So let's do that one first. What are we gonna do?\u000a 20...\u000a Add both up. And then what are you gonna do?\u000a Divide by two.\u000a Why are we dividing by two?\u000a To get the average.\u000a To get the average. Why did you do it twice? Why didn't you just--\u000a And there's two, the two trials.\u000a Why you did two trials? Why wouldn't you just do one? Why do you think that would've been better to do two?\u000a Divided by \u000a Then we wouldn't have to divide it, we wouldn't have to find the average at all. But I guess we'd get a better result. What'd you get there?\u000a 2.35.\u000a 3.73.\u000a That's what I got, 2.35.\u000a You add these two together and you divide them. Remember this is the average. Can you have four?\u000a I divided by two but I got 3.73.\u000a Let's try again. On the calculator I always do things twice to double check.\u000a 2.35.\u000a 2.35. Everybody's good? Okay so let's go down to the bottom of our sheet and we are going to figure out our average speed. So what's our formula for that? How do we figure out average speed?\u000a You do 20 because of the...\u000a Okay, so that's when we took 20 because, you see, we had 30 on our sheet because originally we were doing 30. So let's cross out you changed it to 20. And I think it was Dan that said, if we were to probably, no Hannah said we could probably could put more air in that balloon. But changing the feet, that'll work. Now how fast did the first balloon go?\u000a 19.35 by 20.\u000a Look at your formula again.\u000a 8.52.\u000a Your distance is 20 so you're gonna do your distance divided by your average time. Good?\u000a 8.51.\u000a Okay and I'll come back to check on you you. All right, let's see how these guys are doing. This one's a runner. The line's over here right, Jordan?\u000a 16.\u000a 16.\u000a We're at the end of Nathan's so let's go ahead and figure out Nathan together. I'll come sit in your spot.\u000a They're in here.\u000a So to figure out Nathan, let's talk about it together while we're doing it. We need some more calculators over here.\u000a Wait, what's this?\u000a 641.\u000a Everybody please do catch up. Got your pencils?\u000a Wait, wait.\u000a 641, 575\u000a Tell me again what we're doing?\u000a ...average time.\u000a 6.08.\u000a Does everybody have six? Read it back correctly.\u000a Six point O eight.\u000a Is that how you read it correctly in math?\u000a Six decimal.\u000a Do we say decimal?\u000a Six--\u000a Six point zero eight.\u000a Do we say point?\u000a Six and--\u000a And--\u000a Eight hundredths.\u000a Six and eight hundredths. Ohhhh.\u000a Gotta get it.\u000a So let's look just at our average time for just a second. Stop for a minute and let's look at the top at our average time. How do we know who is going the fastest when we're look at just the top part, just the time?\u000a Average time.\u000a The lowest.\u000a The lowest number, right, 'cause he's getting in the fastest time. So now when we go to the bottom and we're figuring out the speed, how do we do speed? Whoever's the lowest number?\u000a The highest number.\u000a The highest number it's going to be. Let's go ahead and do Nathan and then we'll compare then we'll let Demi do hers.\u000a 16 point...\u000a 16 point...\u000a 16.44, right?\u000a Yep.\u000a So let's look so far at the bottom. Bailey, Jordan and Nathan. Who is the fastest?\u000a So far Bailey.\u000a So far Bailey, okay, so how can we, instead of looking at this, this looks like a whole bunch of numbers to me. What can I do visually just to make it a little bit clearer?\u000a Make a bar graph.\u000a Okay, we can make a bar graph with this. Anything else we can do?\u000a Line graph.\u000a Maybe get each person to make a line graph.\u000a Take your own three times and make a line graph with your own three times.\u000a Because that would be you, right, over time? That would be a great idea. So we can do the straight line graphs. That's a good idea with the line graph, Bailey. So when we make a line graph we'll do that at the end using this information and then we'll do a bar graph using this information. Does that sound good? All right, Demi's turn's up. Let's go.\u000a Let's see how we are doing here. Okay, we're at the very end. So which one ended up being the fastest?\u000a The long one.\u000a The long one. But I think that Devon had a very good prediction. I think his reasoning was good. See that wind blowing? In a race, when you're in a race, and you're running, or when you're in a foot ball team, what side do you want to be on if you have the ball and you're trying to get that ball to the other side? You want the wind to be with you, right? Because if you're against the wind, the wind is pushing on you, so I think Devon had an excellent... Good job, Devon, next time. All right, we're at the bottom. Why do you think that balloon was the fastest?\u000a I put, "The shape of it, the wind went right past it."\u000a All right, remember there was unbalanced force. So the force inside the balloon, where was the force?\u000a The wind, the air.\u000a The air that Devon blew inside that balloon, the air inside pushed the balloon and that's what made it travel and it was an unbalanced force so when you let go--\u000a It probably was the fastest because even though the wind was blowing it's on a round part to where it would spin and the wind would just roll off of the balloon and it would just make the balloon roll but it would still go as fast as it usually goes.\u000a That's a pretty good idea too. It's kind of like when you're driving a car if you're on vacation sometimes your parents, you may see them driving behind a 18 wheeler. Why do you think they would do that?\u000a Because the wind blocks the--\u000a Because the wind is blocking.\u000a 18 wheel blocks it. The 18 wheeler's blocking the wind so you can get more miles per hour, I mean you can get better gas mileage doing that. If you ever see your parents doing that...\u000a Some people don't like to do that though because of rocks.\u000a Rocks, yeah it could be dangerous\u000a Yeah it could be dangerous becuase of rocks. Good job.\u000a

V  And then with Carl's example was down to MSB, marginal social benefit. So how can we put that into words? Marginal social benefit. Andrew?\u000a  Isn't it something that can't really be measured?\u000a Okay. Yes, and it's harder to measure, but how would you explain it? What is it? Think about what we did in the example and say like, everybody is benefiting from washing cars. Right?\u000a  So, what is... It is a social benefit and it's what he gets from the society.\u000a It's what society gets from you.\u000a Yeah, you're on the track, but it's what we get from his interaction. Right? Okay. So, it's the benefit to society for whatever market that is. Okay? So, social benefit, this is going to be the additional benefit, okay? The additional benefit that society... those that are not involved in the transaction, but from society get from one more unit. Okay? Now, I'm going to put next to this slash costs. Oh, just kidding. That's... that's the other document. So, down here is just something is a negative thing. So what this leads to... Do you think these two definitions lead to positive externality or negative externality?\u000a  Positive Positive, they're things that market itself does   not take care of. Okay? Market, obviously, in this example, does not take Carl and offer YTB for all of our benefits, considering it doesn't pay him at all. Right? There are things in society that, when you look at the actual amount someone is paid, they're maybe not paid to the extent of the benefit they get. Okay? So, right now if you flip over to the back, we'll come back to definitions later, flip over to the back. Oh, I'm sorry, on the other sheet, because I didn't put it on the back, on the other sheet you have two columns. I want you first, by yourselves, without talking to someone else, think of, try to think of at least two examples where there are things in society where there are markets for these and it makes everyone better off because they're there, and we all benefit from them. Okay? Go ahead, write them down. Think about it. You really think, you're going to have to defend it. So, think about, on your own, what markets are out there, things that happen, that benefit everybody, not just the people participating in the market. So, benefits more people than are just paying for the service, not just the buyers or the sellers of that service, but outside of it, people are benefiting from it. Write and think and then we'll talk about them. Write and think, write and think.\u000a  Wait, do we need negative ones, too?\u000a Just positive right now, we're going to go back to the negative ones. So, just think of the positive ones right now. Okay, benefit people, again, let's cover the definition again. Benefit people outside of the buyers and sellers in that transaction. Okay? So, we're not talking about just the buyer of someone who goes to a store and buys something and the benefit they get from it, that's marginal benefit, but that person buying this gives other people benefit outside of that person.\u000a  But, like if they built a hospital in the neighborhood, and it has a reputation of being not like, they don't have a lot of equipment, it's not very good. Then, could you like, the property values of the of the town go down.\u000a So, you could talk about... Okay. So, you're on absolutely the right track, so then that would be a negative.\u000a  Like, so what could always be a positive benefit?\u000a Okay. Well, let's talk about some of the negatives. Some of you wrote some stuff down. I saw Matt right away think of something, what'd you write down?\u000a  I said flu shots.\u000a Okay. Why?\u000a Because the more healthy people there are around the less you'll... I don't know. The less sick people there are, the more healthy people there are.\u000a Overall, right? Because, if one of you... Think about this. If one of us... If half of the class gets flu shots and the other half doesn't that mentality shows us that now that other half is more likely to get the flu, right? So, that is an absolutely... Flu shots. What could you make that into a broader explanation.\u000a  Vaccinations.\u000a Vaccinations. Okay? Vaccinations. So, go ahead and write those two down because those two are textbook examples.\u000a  Is medicine good?\u000a Medicine... It depends if it's contagious, but go ahead and be more specific, so you want to put flu vaccine or any kind of vaccine. It's a perfect example because that is a big issue right now. A lot of parents are talking about not vaccinating their children because they're worried about issues of autism that have been indirectly, slightly connected to it, but, for the most part, that has not been proven yet, so now we're seeing other ramifications of that decision. Over here, go ahead\u000a Pro sports.\u000a Pro sports, tell me why.\u000a People who play get paid for doing it and the fans enjoy watching them.\u000a Okay, good. So, pro sports, and we're not even talking about people that necessarily pay for the ticket to go. You might just get to watch on TV. A lot of times on the main stations, you don't even have to pay cable lines. So, you would go ahead and benefit from those.\u000a  If you pay, aren't you technically then part of that?\u000a If you paid for it then you're part of that market.\u000a  So, like vaccinations. You pay for vaccine.\u000a Okay. But that person that pays for the vaccination doesn't get it, but all of us benefit because that one student got the vaccine. Okay? So, that's the key. It benefits people outside of the one paying for it. So, that's why it's social. Okay? Sam?\u000a  YouTube.\u000a Okay. Tell me why.\u000a Because people can freely put up any type of videos they want. That uses creativity and people that want to hear music from anywhere can do it wherever they want.\u000a Absolutely. So, YouTube is a great modern example, because we all benefit from that kind of laughter, that enjoyment. It doesn't cost us anything. People do it for their own interest and we all benefit. Cody.\u000a  Education.\u000a Education. Tell me why.\u000a Students learn and they get to do well in the world and then the world gets some technology.\u000a Okay. Good. Like, you brought up tax payers. So, your parents pay for your education in school. Right? But, by the fact that you're becoming educated, even if they pay for your college tuition. Now, you don't give back just to your parents with that education, you give back to society overall. Right? To everyone, hopefully, in the world, one way or another, you end up giving back to society. For more people than are paying for your education. Okay. Yeah?\u000a  Clean energy, like electric cars or something, because even if you yourself don't drive one, that makes like, it improves.\u000a Okay. Anything green. Absolutely. Anything green like that. You can put green technologies benefit the world, which kind of brings us to one that we're going to talk about with a negative. Okay. Yeah.\u000a  I just had a question. Could you put stock, like since if someone buys a stock it raises the price for everyone else?\u000a Yeah, I've never heard that example, but you could argue that. It's still benefiting a select group, though. I guess in some stocks though, that's millions and millions of people, so, I mean, you might be able to argue.\u000a  I didn't know, because they're still involved in the transaction.\u000a They're only involved if it's their initial one. So, that's why I think it's worth some argument there. You might be able to prove that. I think some of the other ones across the board are a little bit more general but that's definitely something to think about. Andrew?\u000a  Well see, I agree with him, because when the stock prices go up people see that as "Oh, the public is spending more," so that would bring the economy up, which would bring--\u000a That's a really good point because that's an indicator of the health of the economy.\u000a Right.\u000a So, by the stock market being high, it makes everyone employ people. Yeah, that's a good extra point to add in. Yeah.\u000a  What about something like... sorry \u000a  You were thinking of the same thing at the same time? Alright, go ahead.\u000a  So, like, taxpayers, and the government pays them and even if you don't pay taxes you still benefit from it.\u000a You could actually put public works down in your column, because now that we've kind of opened that can, we can think about parks, right? And I get the example all the time. There's a really nice park I live right by Glenn Ellen, and I am not technically in Glenn Ellen but right by there, then I go down there, I run by the park, I take advantage of that public area, and I add to my benefit. So, just by having that park, it kind of benefits more people than just the people that pay for it. So, any public works. Police, you could talk about firemen, they benefit many more people than the people that pay for them.\u000a  The people that clear the snow off the roads. Delightful.\u000a  Can I get some negative externalities then? Flip it back over. Let's go right on. Flip it to the other sheet and let's go to the other thing here and then we'll start graphing it. Marginal costs. Let's put that in our own words here. What is the marginal cost of these? Everyone think about it for a second. Think about it, write down your own definition. This is something you should know like the back of your hand at this point. In your own words, write down the definition of marginal costs.  Write it down,  you already did? ...Marginal cost... You got it Andrew? What is marginal cost? What is marginal cost?\u000a  The extra cost of hiring one additional worker.\u000a Okay. One more whatever it is. It doesn't have to be a worker. We're all thinking about workers because we just got out of inputs, we just got out of inputs and factor markets and resource markets, but, remember those units one, two and three, they had marginal cost, too. If you picture a monopoly graph, what does marginal cost look like on a monopoly graph?\u000a  Upward sloping.\u000a Upward sloping, right? So, we can think of the system in every unit. So, what does it need? One, the additional cost of what?\u000a  One more unit.\u000a One more unit. Let's just keep it like that, because input is just factors. One more unit, because in a monopoly, it's marginal cost of making one more unit. In a labor market, it's the additional cost of one more worker. Keep in mind again, these are both people that are participating in that market. So, I'm going to put... This is the same thing, except for it's the cost. So, you wrote it ready in your own words but make sure you've got that basic idea. Additional cost of one more unit. So, now we're applying it to this new idea. What's the marginal social cost of something? The marginal social cost. Andrew?\u000a  How much society loses for one more unit.\u000a Okay. How much society loses for one more unit or how much it takes away, or cost us when we make one more unit. So, we're going to think, and I'm going to add thoughts here. It's for all of society. So, flip it over, what are some examples, or go to the other sheet. What are some examples of negative externalities now that we've got this down in your mind. What are some negatives? Zach.\u000a  Breathing in pollution.\u000a Pollution. That again, he is on it, this is the textbook definition. Pollution is the most common example. So, what has government implemented to try to curtail pollution? What kind of things have they done?\u000a  Smoking ban laws.\u000a Okay, good, smoking bans. So, you could say pollution, you could also say cigarette smoke is a negative externality. So, government stepped in, which is the type of pollution. The government stepped in and said "No, you cannot smoke in places of employment, you cannot smoke in any public area in Illinois, " it's obviously done by state, but the state has stepped in to curtail this type of externality. Betty?\u000a  Don't they have pollution rights that they can buy in the market?\u000a Okay. Very good. Who do they buy them from?\u000a The government.\u000a Good. So, federal government actually sells pollution rights. So, that's another way that they deal with it. What agency was created to deal with pollution?\u000a  The EPA.\u000a EPA. So, the EPA is out there trying to make sure that only so much pollution happens. Yeah.\u000a  This is kind of more local, but like banks in Elmhurst, like they make a lot of banks, a ton of banks, but every single time they make a new one it seems like less use of all the banks like there's no point to them and it's like a lot of--\u000a So, you're saying that's a negative externality because there's too much?\u000a  Not just that there's just like... Say you replace a store that maybe some people use and make a bank and then there's less to do in Elmhurst.\u000a Okay. Try to think of the best way... I mean, I see what you're saying because that transaction takes away from your enjoyment of living in a town.\u000a  You could put something else there like a new house or a restaurant or something, just don't put a bank. \u000a Okay. So, how would the government fix that?\u000a  ...They could be like "We're not going to let you buy it." The bank buy that lot, they could have said no.\u000a So, they might limit, they might say how many of these business could be. That's a new one. I've never heard of that, but obviously there's something there to that because you're saying it's taking away from the enjoyment of people in the community. It is maybe adding to the wealth of the community with the employment and the income that's being raised, but overall... True, no. I think you've got something there but it's a different lens. Andrew?\u000a I think that a better example for that would be parking lots because then it's just there and not doing anything, whereas for a bank it increases the competition and it increases the rate of... .\u000a  The parking garage closer to the Y encourages people to go down to the retail area of Elmhurst and it kind of does encourage people to... \u000a All right. I like what you guys are going with this, either one of you could make an argument with it. That kind of brings up another point, though. This is somewhat of, Alex, are you with me? This is somewhat of a, this is somewhat of an opinion, right? Because, now you're saying that there's certain things, that there's definite, and those are going to be our perfect examples like pollution. No one in their right mind can argue that pollution gives a benefit to society. They can argue that what they produce that produces pollution is helping industrialize, I mean, talk to China. One example. Their massive pollution, few regulations at all because they're trying to compete with other countries and step up, but they're not, they definitely would say it's worth it. But pollution itself, no one can say that it's good. Andrew mentioned something about the beauty of something. What are some things that people buy or do--\u000a

V Okay, so put these where they need to go on the board. And Liz, your job is graphing. So, Harper tell me about your data. You, your plant is...\u000a 20 centimeters.\u000a  Okay, and it's grown...\u000a 11 centimeters.\u000a  Wow, that's a lot of growth, isn't it? Good job. And, Emma, what's your job? You were the recorder. And so, some of the observations...\u000a  The leaves are bigger. It has grown bigger. In the middle of the leaves there are tiny leaves.\u000a  Cool, in the middle of the leaves, there's tiny leaves. That is interesting. And your cotyledon has come off. Okay, so that's good. Excellent. Okay, so Coby, you're going to be using the board and putting your data up there. So, tell me how high, how tall is your plant now?\u000a  20 centimeters. Okay, let's go check your graph.\u000a  We're out of room.\u000a  I have more. So next time, you'll have a graph that will be, take two of this, and it will be 40 centimeters. Because 20 plus 20 is 40. So, here's your 20 centimeter line, what needs to go down here? Okay, now remember to help Parker with observations. \u000a Natalie does the board. Oh, Natalie, go up there. \u000a  Okay, girls, let's talk about what your findings are, because, just a second. Talk to me about what happened with your plant. \u000a Let's take a look. So, what do you think has, is the reason for it not changing? It was 10 centimeters when you started. It was 10 centimeters again on Monday.  Okay, but that's okay because we know the cotyledon was for germination. It's done with that now, and it can grow without it. \u000a  Is it a growing plant? Looking at your graph. Is it growing? So, maybe the leaves will get bigger and then,\u000a The roots will get bigger, too.\u000a  the roots will get bigger. The water and the nutrients. Okay, let's take a look at your observations. Roots longer, white root, cotyledon fell off, leaves are pointy, bigger leaves. Now, what did we observe about the growth? About the growth of the plant? What did we observe about it? I think we should include that in your observations. Okay, so observer should record that. Okay, boys and girls, I need all board job people to come on up here. Okay, now you guys, one at a time, are going to fill in your data. Make sure that you're choosing a new color. And I'm going to make sure that these have seen all of your, I don't think I've heard about your growth here. Okay, tell me about what happened . Joshua, you need to go sit down, work on the math. You're not ready for that yet? Okay, so talk to your group and see what you need to do next. Okay, so tell me about what has.. .  How about the growth? Right now it is, okay, so Alex... Yes, go get some. Now, your plant has, it's 12 centimeters now, it started at... So, how much total growth has...   Okay, so it started at the 10 and now it's a 12. So, can we make that, who's the recorder? So, we want to make that, because this is how much is it growing. Okay, so it's growing, and let's look at our graph. You've got your day, and now... Oh, so you went up a little bit too high here.   Let's take a pencil, Alex, and just do a small X right there, so that we know that we really wanted our bar to stop at 12. Maybe more so that we can see it. Keep erasing it, that's good.  Don't play with your plant please. If you're all finished, you should be working on the math problems.  Okay, now, let's talk about your plant. Okay, let me come around here. Tell me about your plant.\u000a It started to get bigger. The shell was growing out and we, it's\u000a And how much has it grown total?\u000a 50. Oh, five.\u000a Five, that's right. You started at seven, and now you're at 12, so the difference between That's exactly the same as my plant, too. What I noticed about yours, is over the week, it came out of, like you said, the seed cover came off, and the leaves...\u000a Started to peel and it started to break.\u000a Yeah. Okay, so the stem is really long. Let's put this up here. The leaves are bigger. Who is the observer? You are, okay. And, can we see something about the seed cover? Okay, so while he's doing that, we need to do some important things here. What about the date?  One 30 goes here, because that was Monday. One slash 30.  Okay, and today's date is... Okay, and that's it, because today's the third and this bar shows... Natalie go sit down. This bar shows that... Good job you guys, and you've got that added. And let's make sure that we're gentle with that measuring. You can work on it together. Molly, stay with your group.  You guys work on that together. You guys can work on it together.  So, you guys have had, what's the most common number of seeds they found?\u000a  Five.\u000a Five, good. How about the total number of seeds? Now do we know, is each dot worth one? Okay, so what's the total number of seeds?  So how many seeds in all? Okay, boys and girls, Sophia's finishing up. If you have math extension problems in your table group, please put those to the side. And I'm going to ask Chloe's group and Angel's group, and Derek's group to come and have a seat here on the carpet so we're close to our graph. You do not need to bring anything with you because we have it all up here already. Chloe come join us, please. Alright, Ashton, and Josiah you can move closer, so you can see, or you can stay there. Coby and Isaiah please come join us. Alright. Now one last person needs to fill in her data. Let's see, that would be me, and my height was 16. Okay, so while I'm doing that, take a look at the graph we just built. And think about what are some things that you notice about the graph? What do you see? What are some things in common? What are some things that are different? Turn to your neighbor and tell them one thing that you noticed about the graph.  Okay, eyes on me. Now you tell me, what are some things that you noticed about the graph, Alex?\u000a  That six and three has the same height as us. Okay, so group six and three, and you are group?\u000a  Five.\u000a Five, all have the height of, all the way across, and it's...\u000a  10, 12. Centimeters. That's right, so we have three groups that have the same height. Ashton, what did you notice?\u000a  So, group one, four, and your group, eight, they're all not matching. But all the other ones have a match. So group eight, and one and four are separate. They don't have someone who's kind of similar. So, that leads me to ask about groups two and seven, tell me about them, Blake.\u000a  Seven and two are the same.\u000a Seven and two are the same, they both are the same, why Keith?\u000a  Because they both have 20.\u000a 20?\u000a  Centimeters. So, what group on there has the smallest plant? Alfredo, what group on there has the smallest plant? Group four. Toby, and how tall is group four's plant?\u000a  Ten centimeters. Ten centimeters, that's right. Now, group four, Molly, tell us a little bit about what happened with your plant.\u000a

V  Do not put any button caps in the center of the ridge. Put them right on the bottom edge on each side of that felt. \u000a  Do I get a lot now?\u000a  You get what? You can't do anything down here. You need to help him roll that out. He's going to need help right there. You can put one in one side and then pull it down through there. One right there. When in doubt, put a button. If you're wondering if it should be in there, it should be. We're a little far apart, right here. You definitely need to put one, right here.\u000a  So it's under.\u000a  Reach down right here and put one in.\u000a  This back end going to um... Wrinkle? Before you put a nail there.\u000a  Can I nail the top part of this?\u000a  Yes, absolutely.\u000a  Because if I--\u000a  Your feet need to be on a button, regardless on which side you're on, you need to be on the button.\u000a  Please, nail that one right behind you.\u000a  This sun, coming out like this, makes this felt?\u000a  Hot.\u000a Hot and soft, and it'll tear easily. Now this is 30 pound felt, it's not 15 pound felt. So it's a lot thicker than what, you got two common kinds you're going to be putting on. Okay. Okay how are we doing over here?\u000a  If you lay it up there, the top won't fly down.\u000a  That's right. That's good. Communicate. Communicate with each other, right there.  Did that work out, work for you?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Stand this way.\u000a How many rinds do we need?\u000a  You got your left rind. Now, we need our interval going up to the roof. Tell us what it is. What you need to do on a three tab. How far, what is our interval here? Remember? Can you remember? What is it? Speak up.\u000a  Five.\u000a  Five.\u000a  Five inches, okay? Don't be scared. You know it. You shout it right out. Five inches. Five inches up. Every five inches. Be sure to measure from the top of the seam. Don't measure from here. It's got to be from right here. Measure up five, 10, 15, 20. Just go ahead and mark it up you're roof. Get your layout there and your layout there. Double check each other. Check behind each other. If the layout's not right, and we have to tear shingles back off, are those shingles any good?\u000a  No.\u000a What?\u000a  No, sir.\u000a They're not any good. Let's make sure we double check behind each other and get the layout correct. Remember. Team work, just like on the job.  Anybody can make a mistake. You have a couple of eyes on it. Checking behind, that's a lot better.  You can mark on this side. It's not going to hurt a thing. You can put a bigger mark on there, so you can see it.\u000a  Alright. \u000a Something like that.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  You can see that. That's not small and tiny. That's big. Look at the difference right here, Enrique. My marks, and your marks right here. You can, especially, I mean, this is relatively new felt. This felt gets marked up and scratched up. If you put a large crow foot mark, on here, you're going to know exactly where to hold that thing. Make sure that you get it where you can see it. We're going to cover this stuff right back up...\u000a, Now, watch this felt as I pull this up and down. See those bubbles in it? Right here, I got the bubbles at the top that means I gotta pull it down to get those out. You want this stuff laying flat. If it doesn't it'll probably show up underneath the machinery. If I pull it down too far, it pulls a wrinkle in the bottom. So you want to make sure you get it straight and get all the wrinkles out of it. I've got them out and I'm just a little bit below my line right here, but that's okay. It's more important that this is out right here, that it's on. Does that make sense?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So just make sure. Now you want to come out here at this point and get you one right here. Don't forget our nailing pattern that we discussed. Here, here, here, here, and here. You can feel right here where the plywood is. You want to put a button right here, and your nail line is going to be right in here on this. You don't want to nail into the fascia board. You want to come right across in here and put them every six inches. And about every two feet right here, and one occasionally. Be careful not to step on the felt. Step on the buttons so you don't end up sliding. Just be careful anytime that you're stepping on felt. You never want to step on loose felt. Okay? All right. Go ahead and nail that off. This one right here. See how you're doing this shingle?\u000a Yeah.\u000a We're gonna come back with a starter right here, turned upside down. This right here is gonna have to be cut off. So go ahead and just cut this off even, that'll be fine right now. This one over here, don't nail that yet. Hold on just a second. Come here a minute. You can do it that way. That's one way that you can run it down and cut it, or right here I can just take this soldier, just like this, and I can cut it off right here. Or I can just lap it up there and nail it like it is. The other soldier is coming down to right here. So just come up here and cut this off. Got your hook weight on you?\u000a Yeah\u000a Take and cut one tab off of the shingle, flush it up and nail it on and then go ahead and start your starter tabs up there.\u000a It doesn't have to be straight right? I just cut it?\u000a Pardon?\u000a Does it have to be straight? Just eyeball it?\u000a No, it doesn't have to be perfectly straight, just go ahead and hook your hook blade right here and pull it straight back. That'll be fine. Hold it down. There you go. Never cut back on your handle. These right here we'll be able to use for the caps on top so don't throw these away. Tabs always go in on these. So make sure your tab's in, flush it up, and nail it off. Once you've done this you need to pull a layout, and in the classroom we talked about layout on three tab shingles. If we're gonna go off the end of the building what are we gonna pull?\u000a Thirty, 36.\u000a We're gonna pull 36 inches, and we're gonna pull 30 inches. Top and bottom, topping your lines.\u000a All right.\u000a Does that make sense?\u000a Yeah\u000a Okay so do that. Once you nail this off do that, and then run your starters. You can go ahead and cut that off. The inches right here you can go ahead and cut them, come right here and cut it off right here on the edge of the plywood and then that will have you ready to put your shingles on in a minute. You got a hook blade? Y'all have it? You go ahead and do that, then you can do the other side right here.\u000a\u000a Go ahead and get your lines snapped, put them on there and mark it and pop your lines. Either way. You can do it either way, it doesn't matter, but since we're gonna go ahead and start these they need to be on the 30x36 way out anyway. Flush it up and hang it. \u000a Don't pull that down. If you do that's just gonna take and break that shingle off. This right here is establishing the overhang that we wanted, that inch and a quarter off the edge of the building; so we want our finished shingles to come right here also. When you pull your 30x36 for your layout on your three tab you want to go all the way to the edge of the soldier joist. Go ahead and mark that at the top. You need to keep them moving, you gotta have it marked up there. Go ahead and mark it up there, and mark it right here. Get these popped and then you can go ahead and get Darius to get you a shingle and have it ready to go and y'all will be ready to put these things on. Put your starter on it...\u000a Here? Thirty and 36.\u000a It's raining buttons. See that button landed right there? Y'all make sure that you pick these things up when you're done. You should be able to reach right here and nail this plywood on without any problem. Once they get right here, you can't nail it move down the line.  *Hammering*\u000a Talk to him, what do you want him to do?\u000a Put a nail right there.\u000a There you go. Brandon is telling you right. Y'all hold on a minute. What does putting a nail right there do? I mean you're about to put it right there--\u000a It holds it center, because that way no bubbles or nothing comes up.\u000a It's gonna hold it right.\u000a Keeps it straight.\u000a So really you can start putting buttons from down there to here, it's not going to affect anything. Because he's got that button in. From this point on we can't put any more buttons in it until he gets it where he wants it down here.\u000a He nails it off.\u000a Right, but you could nail this. Go ahead and start doing that. Working together as a group to get the job done is what it's all about. This is not a one man job, you can't roll this stuff out and do it by yourself. It's not a one person job.\u000a If you want to mark that and pull that up to where you can get to it there's nothing wrong with doing that. What you don't want to do is put your foot on that felt right in there. Watch about cutting back towards your hand like that. Just be real careful. There ya go. Mike, put your hand on that roll for him. I got it. That may not be enough to cap that ridge off. So we can roll it as far down as it will go and piece it if we need to. You need a button in it now. He needs help. Help him right here. Yes, sir?\u000a Where at?\u000a Hold on, come on the line right there?\u000a Yeah, come on right here.\u000a Is that on right?\u000a Yeah, next put the felt right here. As far as starting this next row, you got a line on...\u000a Thirty-six inches.\u000a You got a line on 36 inches, and you've got a line on 30 inches. We want to make sure that when you start this next run that you're not breaking. Let me see a shingle, right here, I want you to watch.  I've worked on several houses, the whole boxing  fascia boards and all this is rotten on the house. The reason for that was this right here. They put their starter on like you're supposed to, to allow for the throats of the shingles. We have no water penetration down here. But once you start this starter tabs up, over to your 36 inch line, if I laid this 36 inch shingle down and nail it off I have a straight avenue of water to get down to this felt. This felt will only hold for so long. It's going to get down here, it will rot it out and there you're gonna be. So you wanna make sure that you start this on your 30 inch line and then, give me one more shingle. Then when you butt this shingle up to this one, now what I have is I got my break right here in the center of the full tab and I'm six inches away from it. That's why our nailing pattern here is important. You want to nail above every throat, in the far line, slightly above, in a three tab shingle. Four nails, 1,2,3,4. Just like we discussed on the PowerPoint--\u000a Above the tar line?\u000a Pardon?\u000a Above the tar line?\u000a I can't hear you.\u000a Above the tar line?\u000a It can be in or slightly above. Most people are gonna put them in them or slightly above them. Your video PowerPoint was slightly above, but the main important thing here is that you have it to where... If you put them in random, if I put one right here, or in the middle of these two. I could possibly have a nail where I got a shingle breaking. Or I could possibly have a nail in line with a throat that's gonna line up on top of the next one. It's important to go here, here, here and here. The purpose of this tar line is when this sun heats it, and it heats up you have the next shingle on top of here it helps secure it down so wind don't take and blow it up and rip the shingle off.\u000a So it melts down?\u000a It'll actually seal and melt down to it. All right, you're doing good, but go ahead and make sure that you do this with this hot sun out here today you will wanna keep these cut. So use a shingle to square it up or your speed square. Mark your line and cut it straight down right here. You can nail it on first, that will be fine. Or you can go ahead and cut it before you nail it. You see this shingle right here, that's got the little slit in it? That is exactly six inches is what that is. So you can take this shingle, right here. Put your speed square up here, take your hook blade and follow along it and cut that off. Then you can nail it on if you wanted to do that. Either way, there's multiple different ways to do it. The main thing is don't just take this, put it on the 30 inch line, nail it down, and don't do anything else to it until you get up there. Y'all do it as you go. These hot days like this cool that down and it won't get it's form back. It'll look bad. So we want to keep it looking good. All right, how we doing?\u000a Good\u000a Good. What about right here? \u000a You need to put it along the edge, if you don't follow along the edge...\u000a There's three buttons if you started, one at the top one at the bottom. What's missing? One in between so let's get them in there. Jake you mind getting that one?\u000a Is that going to be enough to roll all this?\u000a If not, we'll get another roll and finish it out. Just go ahead and run with what you got. That'll be okay that will lay down beneath. Be careful about the top edge of that felt. Run that, y'all can stand on this. Get a couple more buttons in between here, we're a little far apart right here. I like to see two foot. Go ahead and hop up here and stand on a button. Get you a couple more in the middle, and then cap that off. Lay it right down the center...\u000a

V  How do you know?\u000a Because my dad works .\u000a  Oh, okay. See, I want us to think about that, because that was something that came up yesterday. Sometimes we think, "Oh that's only stuff men do," or, "That's only stuff women do." But, especially mechanics working on engines and stuff like that, we think, "That's a man's job." But you said your dad works with a lot of women, and Kyle, your dad's a kind of a mechanic, too, and he works with a lot of women, too. So girls, think about that kind of thing. Okay, thank you, very good. All right, now Carter come up, please, Carter? All right, Carter. Tell us about the job.\u000a  works on people when they are injured, firefighters work on burning equipment and carrying test hydrants, and inspect businesses.\u000a  Okay, so your job is... ? \u000a \u000a Say it real loud so they can hear you.\u000a A firefighter and a paramedic.\u000a  Okay, and what are the skills that that job uses?\u000a Math, reading, writing, computer technology.\u000a  There it is.\u000a Be proactive, begin with the end in mind, first thing's first, think win-win, synergize, .\u000a  Great, okay. So all of the seven habits, right? Okay, interesting, who's next? And are there women firefighters \u000a Yes\u000a  and paramedics? Absolutely. Good job, Carter. Okay, Taylor, Taylor Green. All right, Taylor, tell us the job.\u000a A machinist.\u000a  And tell us a little bit about what they do.\u000a Repair and  turbine engines for helicopters and tanks.\u000a  Helicopters and tanks, and they use what?\u000a Math, technology, be proactive.\u000a  Okay, very good. Do you think women can do that kind of job? \u000a Yes\u000a  Absolutely. Okay, so we said math, technology are big ones there working on the helicopters, tanks, things like that. Okay, next let's have Lexi, Lexi Wilson. All right, Lexi. All right, tell us about your job.\u000a Furniture showroom manager. I assist customers with furniture, purchases, inventory, the furniture we have on hand, update customers' orders.\u000a  All right, and we use what skills?\u000a Math, science. Oh, I wasn't watching you.\u000a  That's okay, not so much science.\u000a Reading, writing, computer technology. Be proactive, put first things first, think win-win and synergize.\u000a  Okay, now I'm gonna ask you a hard question. Science, the person with that job indicated they use science in a furniture showroom management position. How do you think they use science?\u000a Maybe they make the furniture.\u000a  The materials maybe they use, and stuff like that. Good, good job, all right, thank you. Okay, so we can see that all of the skills that we're learning in school right now, especially technology skills, computer skills, reading, math, even science, our parents are using those jobs, uh, skills in their jobs right now in real life. So someday, you're gonna be using exactly what you're doing right now in a job, as well as our personal skills, our seven habit skills, being in charge of ourselves, thinking about things ahead of time, planning ahead, putting first things first, good job. All right, now we're gonna take our group cards, and on the cards you have a job listed, one of the jobs that you're looking at in your group, and a skill that goes along with that job. What I want you to do is, as a group discuss, how can we show the use of that skill in our job that we have, okay? So look at your cards, figure out how you're gonna use the skill listed on the skill card, and then we're gonna role-model to the rest of the class the use of our skill and show how we use that skill in the job that's on that card, okay? So start discussing, and then in a few minutes, I'm gonna call you back and we're gonna start showing the rest of the class our skills.\u000a We're the paralegal. We could do, well for reading skills, we could do filing or we could prepare bills for clients. But to prepare bills for clients, we'd have to read you know, who they are, and then for filing we'd have to read whose bill it was.\u000a  Class, when your children get ready for heading where they go down to gym for the program this morning, we are right now in the process of calling kindergarten, we're gonna get them to head down the hallway to the gym first, and then we're going to have second grade come on down, third grade, fourth grade and fifth grade .\u000a Okay, so Payton is gonna lay on the floor, and then I'm gonna get to do a knee surgery on him. First I'll like get a pencil, pretend I'm cutting the knee open and pulling it, and then cutting the muscle, and replacing the broken parts of the knee bone with--\u000a Like using our skills, we can measure the wire right here.\u000a And we could measure how long it could be for the house electricity circuits, and we can measure how long the wire is, and somebody could be in the house and we could measure how long the wire is.\u000a So, let's do the thing we did yesterday. When you're laying on the floor and I'm trying to put the breath back in you, and then I ask Carly what happened, okay. \u000a So you two are doing it. Do you think maybe a table and chairs, and maybe a couch, \u000a Yeah, a sofa.\u000a and then you'll get over behind the table and everything, and then I can say what day and what time.\u000a  And that's writing down what? Writing skills. \u000a Writing skills.\u000a Very good, very good.\u000a We're gonna show like you, you would be like typing on the computer and you would be, and I would come up and ask what you're doing, and so the other people would know what you're doing on the computer, I would come up and ask what you're doing and you would say, "I'm making a blueprint."\u000a Like, 'cause if we did use set up machines for production, and we use synergize, we'd have to work together to do it, and how do we do that? Miss Kimberly?\u000a  Yes ma'am.\u000a How do we act out setting up for productions, setting up machines?\u000a  Well, since you're act, you want to show synergizing, now what does synergizing mean?\u000a Working together.\u000a  Okay, so you need to involve... ?\u000a Working together.\u000a  Yeah, okay. And certainly with being a mechanic, you're working on, what?\u000a  Machines.\u000a  Machines, and so what you wanna try to demonstrate, is everybody working together.\u000a To build a machine?\u000a  Possibly, that would be a good one, I think. All right, we're going to go ahead and start our demonstrations. So I'm gonna ask Morgan, Landon and Abby's group to show us their skill. And tell us what your job is, tell us what's your job?\u000a A paralegal.\u000a  A paralegal and your skill is?\u000a  Reading.\u000a  Okay. Let's see how they're using reading.\u000a  Second grade and third grade, please come on down to the gym, thank you.\u000a  Okay great, that's good. Now what were they doing?\u000a  Filing, reading...\u000a  Filing, exactly, very good, good job. Okay, let's have Luke, Destiny, Payton, and where do you guys wanna go?\u000a Up here.\u000a  All right. Tell us your job.\u000a Certified surgical tech.\u000a  Wonderful, and your skill?\u000a Put first things first.\u000a  First things first, okay.\u000a Clear!\u000a  Okay, great. So what were some, Luke, what was the first thing you did? The first thing first.\u000a I had to gently cut his knee open and pull it apart.\u000a  And then...\u000a Cut his muscle and pull it open, and then get a mini saw and cut the pieces of the knee bone and replace it.\u000a  Okay and then what would be the last thing that a surgeon does?\u000a Stitch the knee back together.\u000a  Okay, all right, good job.\u000a Clear!\u000a  Good job, first thing's first. Okay, all right, now we wanna see Reagan, Mackenzie, and Logan, let's see y'all. And where do you wanna go? In the middle? Okay, that's fine. And tell us your job.\u000a Electrician that uses math skills.\u000a  Okay, electrician.\u000a Come in.\u000a It's over here.\u000a He's measuring how long the wire is.\u000a 3 feet.\u000a  Okay, okay. Now what were they doing?\u000a  Measuring the wire.\u000a  Electrician, and you were, say it again. Say what you were...\u000a We were measuring the wires.\u000a  Measuring. Measuring, okay so, and measuring is part of... ?\u000a  Math.\u000a  Math, very good. All right, good job, good job. Okay, all right, let's have... let's see, it'll be Josh, Alyssa and Taylor G.\u000a Our job is maintenance mechanic--\u000a

V  Well I can start. I just kind of wanted to follow with Lina's going back to the very beginning of the book, and sort of I guess a response to Mariana's comment. I think that a big focus of the book is sort of that beginning story with the starfish, like at the very very beginning when she talks about how one girl tosses back a starfish and then she brings all the other people that toss back starfish, so it's not about making this huge change in one moment, cause that's never going to happen. It's about that one step where you inspire somebody else to take the next step. And since we are young adults, you know if we take that step now and we continue taking those little steps throughout our entire lives, before you know it things are gonna change. So even though it seems discouraging like "oh it's really hard and upsetting", and speaking from personal experience it can be upsetting, it's about continuing on and taking those little steps.\u000a  Yeah you know, at the same time I think there's something hard about it, but it's not something that is beyond our control. It's just--we don't want to appear confrontational. Because I thought we were having this discussion on Friday, I was listening in my science and physiology class to what people were saying, and was listening if there were any instances, although it doesn't count as racism, you count it as prejudice by definition, I was listening for instances and actually something does kind of fit. Because there was this one girl who was talking about how her stepfather was or her mom's boyfriend was really mean and was always cheating on her mom and yelling at her, and he said "Oh I wish you were white, he wouldn't do that stuff if you were white." This was a black girl. There was this other, in my physiology class--\u000a  Isn't that not racism?\u000a  Well, that's not--\u000a  Do you think she was serious or don't you?\u000a  I don't know, but you know even if it's joking, it's still a pretty serious thing to say. And besides, there was a Mexican boy in my third block class who was making fun of one of his friends, some relative saying get a bean or a shnean . But you know, even as jokes these still have effects and these are instances where I could have said "Well no, that's not an appropriate thing to say. "That could be offensive to people." But you know I didn't, just because I didn't want to be confrontational. So obviously that's some fault of my own for not getting involved there.\u000a  Going off of what Tomas said about the ethnic jokes or whatever, I'm wondering if you're considered actively racist if those jokes don't bother you. Like I hear that all the time in my third block class, and it doesn't bother me. It's kind of funny sometimes. Because a lot of the time it's not interracial, it's the same race. You know what I'm trying to say? There's no Armenians, but I can't roast another Armenian. Should I throw this? This is not gonna work.\u000a  Laser it, bro.\u000a  Maybe you should just call on somebody and then throw it. \u000a  I think while racist jokes can show racism they can also show an amount of... show how comfortable we all are with other races and I make fun of my parents, I make fun of my teachers because I'm comfortable with them. \u000a  Maybe we should talk about that.\u000a  And I mean, I can  do it because we love each other and  it's okay,  it's unconditional. So even if they may get annoyed at me we become stronger from making fun of each other. I'm scared.\u000a  So going back to  what Lina was saying at the beginning and what Tomas was saying a little later is with the escalator thing, I felt that was a good metaphor for the system but it also struck me as a bit of a false dilemma. She makes it out that racism is the biggest problem facing us today, and not to say that it's not a giant problem but I feel like one can be passively anti-racist whilst working actively towards anti-poverty, anti-hunger, anti-war, and making a difference in the world whether it's in the field of racism or not. And then going back to what Tomas said about the... and I lost my point, what was it? It'll come back to me. Who wants to go?\u000a  I think Tatum would agree with you and she would even I think say that while you're actively combating say poverty, you are having a positive impact for, say poor African American families. And she points out the correlation, statistically speaking between ethnicity and class. But one thing I want to say in relation to some comments from over there is that I think that one thing that it means to become an adult, and I'm thinking what Holly said, is to suddenly be forced to think of global concerns and think beyond our own individual needs and wants. And I think it's really as simple as that what Tatum is asking of people. That she's asking them now you consider your duties to the people around you. I want to hear from other people.\u000a  I got my point for Tomas, it's coming back. It came back to me. I had two points when I asked for the yarn then I forgot one of them, and I just remembered it.\u000a  I want to encourage other people to speak up too. And we've got 10 minutes left. There's a lot of voices that haven't been heard yet today. What I'm gonna do is something that I'm gonna encourage other people to do too. I'm gonna toss it to somebody who's not wanting to speak and make them make their voice heard.\u000a  I'll keep it short and then I'll throw it to someone.\u000a  Okay. Toss it to somebody who doesn't have their hand raised though.\u000a  So back to what Tomas said about the confrontational thing, is it's really hard to strike that medium between either being confrontational or being patronizing. And it's the fear of the reaction of either one of those that I think stops most people from speaking up. Like either confrontation or you're appearing patronizing and therefore destroying racial relations even more. So, Samuel?\u000a  Yeah, sure. Well I was gonna say out of what Chris was saying sometimes racial humor can actually-- I think while sometimes it contributes to racism, and I have a problem with telling too many off-color jokes and gender-related jokes. But I think sometimes that kind of humor can start to eliminate prejudices and bring that into the broader dialogue and stuff. So if you look at people like comedians say like Dave Chappelle, how many can say that he's a racist person because he makes lots of race-based jokes in his comedy? On the contrary, I think he actually helps bat those issues by bringing that humor out.\u000a  When Tatum mentions the fact that she thinks there's no such thing as being passively anti-racist, I think what she means by that is like it's sort of hard. I actually got to mention you know, our society we have a lot of comic jokes and all of these other things here present in the system of housing and stuff is... unweighted or whatever. It's kinda difficult to... how should I say it? I don't know what I was trying to say. I can't put it out into words but anyways, I kinda agree and disagree with her. It's like you can do little things to change, however what I was trying to say is that it's a lot out there and it may be difficult. That was all I was trying to say. I don't even know. Here you go.\u000a  What I would say about jokes and stuff at times it shows that you know we're addressing it sorta kinda in a way, but at the same time it just shows how much we see it played out in our society. And then for some people that say it that aren't actually trying to make a difference it's like, I mean it's gonna be hard to make a change and be like "Hey, let me correct that." Because to them it's just like all fun and games. But to us it's like, okay. Yeah. \u000a  It stopped. It died. I agree completely with what Laticia is saying. Although for instance how Sam was saying about Dave Chappelle, although people make jokes as they do address that in that manner, it's not like people make jokes so people understand that "Oh, we need to break these stereotypes." I've come to realize that every joke has a little bit of truth in it. Obviously yes, by making these stereotypical jokes yes we're addressing it, but my point I guess is just it doesn't necessarily prove that people are anti-racist.\u000a  Alright, I just wanted to say the question, the prompt is why is there no such thing as being passively anti-racist? And it's because racism is so ingrained in our system and our being. From when we're born we're exposed to racism consistently. And because of that we can't be passively anti-racist. Our default setting for the most part is being racist. Not overly racist, but we are. So it's not possibe just to not be racist by being alive. Once you come to being in this world, you are racist. You can't change that, so that's why there's no such thing as being passively anti-racist. You have to work at being anti-racist. It just doesn't happen.\u000a  So I completely agree with what Wyatt's saying. The way I look at racism is it's like a poison and once you've been injected or you know, whatever to it, it stays in your system forever. And there's always gonna be a little part of it no matter how much you try to get it out of your system there's always gonna be a little bit of it in you. So before you can fix the people who have been exposed you have to get to the source of the poison and stop it. Which would be parents or teachers. I don't know.\u000a  I'm a source of it? \u000a  You know like crazy teachers who say the wrong thing and then students go home and like, "Oh yeah my teacher said this" and then they go and tell their other friends and stuff and they kind of get passed around. I don't know, it's not you. I'm just saying. \u000a  I don't believe you.\u000a  Yeah, I agree with Wyatt and Brooks because I think that we were talking about how Disney movies may have these subliminal racist undertones but at the same time, there are racial undertones to everything that anyone says, basically, right? There are always implicit messages which aren't necessarily said overtly which may come through to the way people word things. There are subtle subtle messages and the attributes come through peoples' speaking. So everyone's totally surrounded by all sorts of prejudices from all sorts of different sources from the time they can understand words. So, yeah.  If someone's gonna hit you in the face, it might as well be this.\u000a  I want to go back to what Brooke just said about parent kin thinking about racism. I mean, how many times have you ever hear your parents saying teach you a lesson about racists? They don't even try.  They might just give you some parental info on your surrounding. Or just say those joke you were talking about.\u000a  So you're saying that you think parents should have conversations with kids?\u000a  I'm saying that parents should know how to combat racism, and they don't even try.\u000a  Going back to what Ryan  said earlier, I agree because if they keep using racist jokes as jokes then it will become overused and kind of a clich so people won't want to use it anymore.\u000a

They got in a wagon train.\u000a A wagon train, and what was a wagon train?\u000a  It's a bunch of covered wagons. \u000a Oxen, in a wagon train.

Why did they not make a wood house?\u000a  Because there weren't a lot of trees on the prairie.\u000a Okay, but you said the trunks were made out of wood, how did they get trunks made out of wood?\u000a  Because they made it before they left.\u000a They made it before they left, that's correct.\u000a Can the doll have long hair?\u000a You're doing a great job. You're just gonna have to imagine that. That's right, they made their trunks before they left. Did they just need one trunk?\u000a  No.\u000a Okay.\u000a  Twice.\u000a Okay. Do you know Eli? Can you go show me on the map, where the pioneers went on the prairie, where the prairie was?

In a log house they're burning buffalo chips?  That's right, in a sod house, they're gonna burn buffalo chips. Why not wood in a sod house?\u000a Because, in a prairie, they would run out of, if they had enough wood, they would build a wood house, build a log house.\u000a That's exactly right.  Were there buffalo chips where there were log houses?\u000a No.\u000a Why were there not buffalo chips?  So buffalo cannot run in the forest where the trees were. Where did the buffalo live?

V Okay, so...\u000a  They're equal because of Right Angles Theorem\u000a You are skipping a step. Again. Trevor, tell him the definition of an altitude. You tell me I have an altitude. You have to tell me then what's the consequence of an altitude. Read the definition of an altitude. Say it.\u000a The definition of an altitude is that it intersects the opposite side of the angle at a perpendicular angle. I don't know how to word that right,  but...\u000a Somebody help him out. He's making sense, but somebody...  Yes.\u000a Alright. It goes through the opposite vertex and it intersects the opposite line perpendicularly, if that's a word.\u000a Don't say through because an altitude is bounded. It starts at a vertex and it goes... Okay, so! Now, Isaac, What should be the consequent step two there?\u000a  Right here?\u000a Yes. Whatever they gave you in those definitions, Trevor's and the improved definition by Trey, nobody said anything about congruent angles. What did we talk?\u000a  That they're both right angles.\u000a  That they're right angles.\u000a No, we didn't.\u000a That BD is perpendicular to AC.\u000a Ah-ha!\u000a That's what I got.\u000a Nice. That's what it is. So, just write on top of that, honey.\u000a  Right here?\u000a Yeah, the step two, you should have that. Right? You have to go with the definitions when you have a justification because that's what reason says. It comes from a defintion.\u000a  And why is that  because of...\u000a Tell him. Why is that?\u000a Definition of altitude.\u000a Definition of altitude. \u000a Okay. You see how when we were working with the picture, we put those boxes on the triangle. What did those boxes say, indicate?\u000a  That they're right angles.\u000a They're right angles, okay. So, that should be... And why do we have right angles? Somebody tell me. Why do we have right angles?\u000a Definition of perpendicular lines.\u000a Yes. That's a consequence if you have perpendicular lines.\u000a  So, I'm going to write, ADB and CDB are right angles?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay. \u000a  You guys, the rest of you might have started with the fact that it's an angle bisector, right?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a And that's okay if you started with that. It's okay. Doesn't matter. You could have started with the BD is congruent to BD. You don't have to start with a given, but that's traditionally the way we do it. \u000a I can't believe I got this. It's because of...\u000a  It's the definition of perpendicular lines. \u000a  What's this?\u000a Okay, wait. Breathe in and out. Now, let's go see what's going on. Okay, step to the side. ADB and CDB. Okay. Still, you need to have an angle, a side, and an angle. Do you have a congruent angle? After all that work.\u000a  I'm going to do that now.\u000a Okay, what are you going to put?\u000a  Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDB because the definition of right angles.\u000a  Nope!\u000a  Right Angle Congruency\u000a  Right Angle Congruency Theory.\u000a Well, I haven't...\u000a What is the definition of right angle?\u000a That all right angles are congruent.\u000a What's the definition of a right angle?\u000a 90 degrees\u000a It measures 90 degrees\u000a Yeah, yeah. All right angles are congruent is the Right Angle Theorem that he's writing.  Okay, let's see what we have. If you would number them, that would help. That's one. And what's the consequence for after one?\u000a  I'm trying.  I am old and somewhat blind from here. But I know... Is that a "2" right under that? At the perpendicular line, you have "2". What is that?\u000a  AD is perpendic...\u000a No, after that.\u000a  Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDB.\u000a Wait. He wrote it.\u000a  It's all jumbled up and it's all there, so...\u000a But, wait a minute. Let's make sense out of this because it has to flow, okay? You know when you have your perpendicular line, What should be at the  perpendicular line? The direct consequence if you have perpendicular lines, is what?\u000a  That the angles are...\u000a Somebody, somebody\u000a  That they're right angles.\u000a  I want to say that,  but then--  I just don't want to say  something that's wrong\u000a No, you're fine. You were not here yesterday. And it seems you're doing great. Hey, so, take the blue marker, so that everybody can see. Take the blue marker because I would like to re-number it so they can see it, okay? So, re-number them again. One is the given, the altitude.\u000a  So, you want me  to write over?\u000a Yes. And then that's two.  Now, what should be three? Don't put three on that one. What should be three? Somebody tell him.  What should be three?\u000a The angles.\u000a The right angles.\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay, now, honey, after you have right angles, what are you going to say?\u000a  That, uh, Definition of Right Angle Theorem.\u000a No.\u000a Okay, so right angles. What happens after right angles? Because remember angles are angles. I need to talk about angle congruency. But, you haven't said that. You talked about right angles. So now, what are you going to say? You have it there, honey.\u000a  Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDE.\u000a Okay, so that should be the next step.\u000a  That's four.\u000a Okay, you remember. Good. Great. Remember when I asked you at the beginning, when we first started doing proofs, to keep track. So, you have mentioned an angle congruent to an angle?\u000a  Yeah, right here.\u000a Not yet, we haven't touched that guy yet. We don't even have a number for that guy. He's just floating in there. What angle is congruent to what angle? Have you mentioned that one angle is congruent to another angle?\u000a  Yeah, ADB is--\u000a You just did right?\u000a Okay, go cross out one of the As. I don't think you specifically did this, but I've noticed that some of you. I've noticed in Abby and I would notice in a couple of you. Taylor, that you were always... After you prove something, you found it within your proof. You would kind of cross it out in here. Okay, I found this. Or some of you would come over here and actually write it here. It's like you're taking attendance. I need angle for an angle. I already have an angle. Keeping going. See what I'm doing here. I showed you this way back. Yeah.\u000a He's probably getting confused because of number three. How he put ADB-- because it should be ABD and DBC instead of ADB.\u000a  Wait, what, what, what?\u000a Number three. The original number three.\u000a  Yeah\u000a The B should be in the middle instead of D.\u000a It should be ABD and DBC.\u000a That's right.\u000a  That's why!\u000a  That's why! Yeah!\u000a  I didn't noticed that.\u000a  Yeah, I thought he put that.\u000a  You guys are smart. Yeah, that's how you got confused with everything else. Okay, so now, segment BE is congruent to segment BE because of reflexive property, so that's another side. And then it's given that BD is an angle bisector, so that means angle ABD is congruent to angle CBD\u000a  Okay, but the issue here is he hasn't listed that as a given, right? Just like people say, "Well, you're making that up. "How do you know that?" And you just say, "It's given," but you didn't write it, --\u000a Yeah, he did.\u000a Yeah, yeah he did.\u000a It's right there.\u000a It's number four.\u000a  He just did it wrong.\u000a  It's backwards.\u000a  It's all there.\u000a  So, that should be step... Wait a minute. One, two, three... four, five...\u000a Four should be one\u000a  Whoa.\u000a Three should be two\u000a One should be...\u000a  So, there's a one, two, three, four... and then five... Wait, five, right here.\u000a  Six right above it.\u000a  six, seven.\u000a  Okay, can you change the numbers?\u000a  Fix the numbers.\u000a  Yeah, please fix the numbers.\u000a  It's there.\u000a Okay, we got it. We have an angle bisector, the consequence of an angle bisector. We have an altitude, the consequence of an altitude. We have reflexive property, so do you have them all?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a So, what could you say now? The triangle... I'm going back to the black marker...   Okay, let's get him out of the hot seat, okay? Micah! Yes, Micah. You tell us, is he finished with the proof?\u000a No.\u000a Why?\u000a Because you said no.\u000a Who said no?\u000a You.\u000a But okay, you're supposed to tell me if there's something.\u000a Well, you have to put that... it is the... I don't know.\u000a Frank to the rescue!\u000a He hasn't proved that it's isosceles yet.\u000a And how do you prove that it's isosceles?\u000a I don't really know.\u000a That sounded so tough, Frank.\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay, you say, segment AB and segment BC are congruent by C... Wait, how do you say it?\u000a CPCTC.\u000a Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent.\u000a I always mess it up!\u000a I can't do the CPC...  I can't do that. I say the whole thing.  Okay, now, Frank, is he finished?\u000a  I think.\u000a  Is he?\u000a  No.\u000a  Not yet.\u000a  No, he's not. Okay, why? Tell him why.\u000a Since you have the two sides congruent and the isosceles triangle needs two sides congruent, then you can say that the triangle is isosceles now because AB is congruent to BC.\u000a So what should be his number 10?\u000a Triangle ABC is isosceles. And that would be the definition of an isosceles triangle. Yes!\u000a  I'm so proud.\u000a It keeps getting better. I told you it would get better.\u000a  Teamwork.\u000a  I was stressing last night because I was like, it's so hard.\u000a  Okay, you guys understand what this means, but I'm trying to hurry it.\u000a  Good job, Isaac.\u000a  Yeah, Isaac, a good job.\u000a Very good, Isaac! One big clap for Isaac, one, two, three \u000a Alright!\u000a Yeah!\u000a You did good!  Okay, so. You know what?\u000a This is the proof, that the new program where I give you... because I want to make sure you get it... enough information to do this on our own, okay? And then, I'm not going to  write it out. We're going to talk about how to do it. And then you're going to complete it tonight at home. So, what do we need to do? What is given there? Jonathan. What's given?\u000a The middle one?\u000a  This one, honey.\u000a CB is an angle bisector of ACB. CD is an angle bisector of ACB.\u000a  Okay, what does that give you? Once you have an angle bisector? No, that's not it. Don't look at that one. That's a totally different proof. This is one that I'm going to give you tonight. So, what does CD being an angle bisector of angle ACB mean?\u000a

V We all know it's splash. Just put it next to it.\u000a Your turn.\u000a Okay, let's see.\u000a  How are we doing? How many animals do we have? Do you have a few?\u000a We think mussel...\u000a It can be in the middle.\u000a It can be in the high tide and the low tide.\u000a Because it can move around. And then it eats clams and clams would be in the high tide.\u000a It can grab on to the wave. It eats clams.\u000a It says this eats clams.\u000a I saw the, of the mussels sort of in the mid-high tide one day.\u000a When you were out at the tides before?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Excellent, so you're using some of your previous experience to help you. Good, excellent. Okay, I'll be right back.\u000a It's a snail. The shell protects its soft part. As a hermit crab grows, it moves into a new shell. It may take an empty shell or steal one from another.\u000a So it's like war.\u000a I think that would be in the high.\u000a Yeah, that's a high.\u000a Yeah, I think the high tide.\u000a I thought it would be in the mid or low. But no.\u000a Well it could move down there.\u000a What's your next one? Tuesday, put this circle right on top of the clock. Same time. Same height. Wow, that's pretty interesting isn't it? Good for you. Oh, you're looking at your first one. What's your first one? Yeah, just line it right there on the clock.\u000a That's eight.\u000a Yep, like eight. Yeah, excellent. And Margo you're getting your first measurement? Negative one! Oh, awesome. Monday's negative one. Hello Kazhu, I will show you where you need to go.\u000a It's negative something.\u000a I don't know what negative. It's right here. Look here.\u000a  Did you find out they went that low?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Mine went to negative six!\u000a Wow!\u000a I didn't put Tuesday. and then I'm going to put a block under it.\u000a You had one that went really low. Look at that. Awesome. You set that up first pretty well, didn't you? Look's like we got Monday and Tuesdays getting done. Wednesdays are being worked on. Perfect. So much to hear, what it is you guys are gonna discover from the charts.\u000a  Let's do a worm. Whatever that says. They have a veil of flaps on each side. The worms usually stay buried in the sand. If a wave comes, it swims back down toward the sand and wiggles into it.\u000a I'm pretty sure that's low.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a No, how about maybe high?\u000a High tide.\u000a High tide.\u000a No, but the waves crash there a lot actually.\u000a Splash!\u000a There's more of the sand.\u000a Yeah, I think it would be splash.\u000a  Want to try splash on that one? Good. And you guys thought that because what did it say?\u000a It said it buries in the sand and if a wave crashes it has to wriggle back down.\u000a Okay.\u000a So, it stays in sand as much as it can.\u000a How many does Nate have? Oh, two.\u000a  The whelk? That's a scientific name. That's a tough one, isn't it?\u000a Ah, it's hard.\u000a It's hard, it's okay you can skip it. Just say "look for the whelk on rocky beaches."\u000a "On rocky beaches and on rocks, sift, or muddy gravel beaches." "The shell of the snail can reach about two inches in height." "It is a scavenger, feeding on kin. It also preys on injured animals such as limpets" "The snail has also..."\u000a So, I thought the sentence said "it also preys on injured animals, such as limpets." So "preys on them" what does that mean?\u000a I think I know.\u000a What do you think, Andrew?\u000a It means catch them and eat them.\u000a It catches them and eats them. Where do you think that would need to be if it's gonna eat limpets?\u000a I think it would be in the high tide.\u000a Oh, you've got both of them. So, you also might want to talk to Addy and find out what Addy has. And try to figure out where those guys are before you place your whelk. No, so Addy what do you think? What is one of yours? Let's find out what yours are, right?\u000a Under each shell. I think it's already in the high tide zone.\u000a I thought it would be in the splash.\u000a Wait, no.\u000a High, high, high.\u000a Yeah, high tide. Okay, the limpet...\u000a Guys, I thought it would be in the splash.\u000a No, remember you gotta, like, figure. Okay, I'll let you two go.\u000a I thought it would be splash because...\u000a No, I don't think that...\u000a The thing should be underwater most of the time.\u000a It says "Watch for whelks on rocky beaches and muddy or gravel beaches."\u000a It could be in the middle.\u000a True. Yeah, mid.\u000a Okay, mid. No, you have to say where the other food is.\u000a I put it to high splash.\u000a Okay, you go, then you go.\u000a Guys look, too much heart. One that was lower than... negative four. And this is negative four.\u000a  What do we have? Margo, did you finish your graph? Excellent. How are you doing on yours, Joshua? You finished?\u000a I'm on Friday.\u000a You're on Friday. So, maybe you two should start setting up your circle. Pick your question, Margo. Joshua. And this is your question. And set up your circle right on there. Grab your graph and a chair. And sit in your circle off to the side there.\u000a I think it's either low or splash.\u000a No, not splash.\u000a Not splash. Otherwise there wouldn't be anything.\u000a Lower mid.\u000a I'd think low.\u000a No.\u000a No, remember at the aquarium, they were underwater completely. No things sticking out.\u000a Only some of the spine.\u000a Yeah, but the rest, it was just... boom there.\u000a I am doing it. I'm doing the sand dollar for my... report. And it's high.\u000a No, remember at the aquarium also, it was at the bottom of the tank. Remember?\u000a  No, it was at mid. I remember, I checked. And also anyways... I'm doing the sand dollar.\u000a Okay.\u000a  Okay, so Margo, do you have your question with you? So, everybody gets a chance to converse and talk about the answers to that question. Or maybe you might realize something or come to a realization about your information. And all of you can contribute to the answer. Okay? So, go ahead.\u000a Were there any patterns you noticed doing your graph? What are they?\u000a I noticed that first it went to medium then it went lower and then it went higher and higher the third, fourth, and fifth time.\u000a My pattern was that each time... each level started getting higher and higher and higher and so it's really high.\u000a Mine would go to 12, to 12, then it would go to 11, and then it went down to 10 and then it went down to nine. It went lower and lower.\u000a  And it was kinda like a mix.\u000a Monday and Tuesday were the same and then it started going higher and higher and higher, all the way.\u000a What was unexpected? I'll go first. It went lower than the average on the chart. It went lower and then it started going higher and higher.\u000a I thought it was just gonna stay in the negative parts but it actually went up to the nine.\u000a  In mine, I expected it to be some different levels, but it kept going higher and higher and higher and then when it started to go even higher it just kind of stayed the same.\u000a Mine went higher and higher and higher and higher again. Okay, who's next?\u000a  I am. Unless you want to go. Read your question.\u000a What was your highest tide? What was your lowest one? My highest was Tuesday and Friday. They were both negative one. And Friday and Thursday, they were both negatives. Everything was negative.\u000a  Everything was negative on yours? Wow! Negative.\u000a Even one below the negatives. You have five negative. Negative five.\u000a  Yeah, that's right because you're grabbing, you don't realize you'll get a negative five.\u000a That tide's really low.\u000a  Very low tide level, yeah. Margo has her hand up, go ahead Margo.\u000a On the day that was highest, was Friday. It went all the way up to nine. And my lowest was Monday and Tuesday because they're both negative one.\u000a Oh, and my lowest was Thursday. \u000a Thursday and it was 9.\u000a  Thursday and it was nine?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  And Maia what was your lowest tide?\u000a My lowest was Monday. It was about at eight and then it starts going higher and my highest was at 12.\u000a So, I'm wondering now if we look at all of our charts, all of our graphs, who had the highest tide of everybody? Who had the highest? So, you had a 12.\u000a I had two twelves.\u000a No, she had 11.\u000a So, it looks like maybe Callen and Maia have close to each having a 12.\u000a I have the lowest score. I have the lowest. I think Joshua got the lowest with a negative five reading on his. Anybody else have a negative five?\u000a No. I have a negative one. But no negative fives.\u000a  Okay, alright. So, whose question's next? Alright, I'll be right back.\u000a

V Okay. So, what's going on with this group? You go ahead since you did it.\u000a We made like a T chart.\u000a Oh, fantastic. Graphic organizing. Love it.\u000a We put the ones that we're going to delete over here and then keep over here.\u000a Now we're discussing why we deleted these or chose them.\u000a Was it pretty easy to choose the keepers?\u000a It was.\u000a Yeah, we agreed on most of them.\u000a What about the delete? Have there been some discussions?\u000a We had to think about the smart and the healthy and religious.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. Good.\u000a Oh and stay in school. They don't have to stay in school.\u000a So, there were some that you had to discuss a little more?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Tell me some of your thoughts. Which was the most difficult?\u000a Probably the religious.\u000a And also smart.\u000a Tell me a little bit about the discussion you had with religion.\u000a Well, first of all we thought that it wouldn't be, but then we thought some people had different religions and other people...\u000a My dad has a friend--my dad has a friend that isn't a Christian, but he's still a really good person.\u000a It's just like as you grow up being a Christian, that's just what you think. But then as you think about it, that's not how you're a good person.\u000a Okay. So, you stepped back from what you knew and you looked around. Were you able to come up with some examples, like was it your uncle?\u000a No, it was just a friend.\u000a A friend. So, were you able to come up with some examples of people that were not religious people.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Can you tell me some qualities on the list that they have even though they are not the Christian?\u000a My uncle, he's not religious, but he's a teacher. So, he's helping kids and stuff and he's really nice.\u000a My neighbor, she's really nice. You can't even tell that she's not religious. You always think she is. She's kind and friendly. She's respectful. I don't know, just really nice.\u000a Okay. So, when we first put up our list, that was one of the qualities that were on lots of list--boom, boom, boom, then just religious. So, we had to step back from it to really stop and think about that.\u000a Or they could be not doing their best in school but they could be a really great friend or person.\u000a Very good. There's more than one kind of smart.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Do you think that having good qualities and keeping yourself with those qualities is another kind of smart?\u000a Yes.\u000a And you're right. I know some mentally challenged friends, people, that are some of the most kind-hearted people. Good discussion. Good going. Okay. Why  did you do happy?\u000a Because whenever you're sad then you just have that gloomy feeling hanging over you all the time.\u000a Yeah. And also if you're not happy all the time, you don't have it all the time, every minute--you can't just be depressed all the time. And then...\u000a Stay in school.\u000a Yeah. Why did we go into stay in school?\u000a Thank you, Lexi. Come on over here, Veronica. Okay, ladies, what is your question?\u000a We're going two ways. I kind of think that you need to be religious. Because if you go to church it helps you become a good person. But then at the same time, there's like people in the world that are really great people but they're un-relgious.\u000a They can't be religious.\u000a Like countries?\u000a And they're still a good person even though they can't.\u000a Also, we were thinking people that do go to church aren't always taking what they learn and using it in their lives.\u000a So, you have found some examples of religious that are not exhibiting other qualities and then people who are not religious who show a lot of these qualities.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. So, that kind of goes both ways.\u000a I think we should delete.\u000a I don't know. I can go both ways.\u000a So, you can see both sides.\u000a Yeah.\u000a You don't have to be religious to be a good person.\u000a Okay. So, can you set aside what your own religious beliefs are that if you believe this way, if you don't believe this way, something bad will happen to you? Can you set that aside and just look at the person's qualities?\u000a My sister has a friend that goes to college with her and she doesn't hang out with her that much, but she doesn't believe in God. And that's her religion. But I guess that would be their religion. So, really, everybody has a religion kind of, but they can't express their religion or go to church and stuff like that.\u000a Okay. So, which one's our leader? Jordan, you're our leader. So, do you want to take another vote and see where it stands? Okay. You're changing in a way? Okay. So, where do you stand now?\u000a Those are all qualities that make up a good person, but again, we all had to make a decision on it. But again, other groups can have different opinions about that or different opinions on how to make a good person. So, we can think that you need to be religious but then another group can say you don't have to be religious.\u000a Right. It's all about what this group decides.\u000a I was also thinking about the Ten Commandments, that it has a choice. If you want to be religious, that's also putting that in mind.\u000a Okay. So, are you leaning towards deleting or keeping?\u000a We're just talking .\u000a How about you, Grace?\u000a I kind of think it's... I don't know. I think we should keep and then I think that we maybe should delete because you don't have to go to church to be a good person.\u000a Does anybody have a personal experience in their own family of somebody who's not religious that is a really great person?\u000a Well, like they don't go to church or they're just not like... ?\u000a Okay. That is a great statement that Jordan made that will give us pause to think. What does "religious" mean to each one of you? So maybe that's another place to start. What does that word mean? And then that might help you decide whether to delete it or keep it.\u000a Because going to church doesn't necessarily make you religious.\u000a You can just walk into the church and listen to your pastor's sermon. It doesn't mean that you're a good person.\u000a So discuss that for just a moment. Okay.\u000a What does religious mean to you?\u000a I think it means being saved and saying sorry for our sins and asking for forgiveness. So, that's like the main writing.\u000a In my opinion of being religious, I think that you take what you learn in a church's sermon and you use it in your world. You know what I mean?\u000a Yes.\u000a If it's a very touching sermon and it's what you believe, you can take it back and you can use it to help you go through problems or whatever and then I think also religious is that you're willing to share with other people.\u000a Yeah. You're not embarrassed.\u000a You're not just holding back and keeping it to yourself.\u000a No matter if people aren't religious and they'll come up to you and make fun of you here at school. You're just willing to put it aside. I used to go to a different school. I don't remember now. But he was a very, very, very good student. And for some reason, they did want to . I don't know why. I didn't figure it out. The pastor got fired because it was just a job to him. He did something very, very inappropriate that a pastor could do with another person within church. And he left because he was so embarrassed.\u000a Why would he have been embarrassed? I would have felt bad, not just embarrassed.\u000a And he was married. You know what I said about you have to be willing to share? Well, there was this one pastor...\u000a Let me turn the camera on you. Hold on.\u000a So, there would kind of be a way of saying that it doesn't really work out. So, if both sides are .\u000a Okay. All right. Regan, let's hear again what you said about the deleting, why would you thought you would delete it.\u000a Oh, I'm not the one who said delete.\u000a Oh, okay.\u000a I said delete it because I know people that are not atheist who are not--\u000a Yes ma'am. I will tell her. Thank you. Scarlet, Vicki is not here today. Thank you, ladies, for getting quiet when the intercom rang. Now, discuss, continue.\u000a They're still Christian but they're still just as good as any other person would be. That's why I think we should delete it. But I don't know.\u000a Okay.\u000a Maybe it's the way she put it because she said it changes you inside, but being Christian, it does kind of change you inside.\u000a Okay. So, you have a person in your life that you consider to have some qualities that make them a really great person but they are not religious?\u000a Yeah. They're not atheist but they're not Christian.\u000a Okay Do you have anybody in your life that's not religious that you find a lot of good qualities?\u000a My grandpa. He's not saved, but he still believes.\u000a I guess it just depends on how the person acts.\u000a Okay? How about you? Do you have anybody in your life?\u000a Yeah.  named Delaney, she's an older person. But she really, really likes  her house and stuff.\u000a And would you consider her to have qualities that make a really great person?\u000a Yes.\u000a But you would not consider her religious?\u000a Oh no. But she is not really atheist, but she doesn't believe in anything. But she doesn't believe in being atheist.\u000a So, we're kind of on the fence on this one in that some people think it needs to be deleted and others think no, it makes a difference. Do you know anybody who says that they are religious and they don't have qualities of a great person?\u000a Yes. Some people, as soon as they get out of church, they'll go out and do stuff that wouldn't be religious.\u000a Yeah. It's kind of like they don't have a Christian background.\u000a They'll sit in the church room and they say, "I'm a Christian because I'm here at church," but really you go do this at other places.\u000a So, then I guess it all boils down to what do you believe or what do you think that religious means. A lot of people would say, "Oh, I'm religious," but then like you said, spend the rest of the week doing things.\u000a Yes. But they're kind of being truthful if they say they're not religious and they're not really religious. So, it's kind of two things--so truthful, but they're not religious.\u000a Or maybe being a fake Christian, like sitting in church. They'll watch a football game just waiting for church to end.\u000a But maybe that's kind of worse than saying, "I'm not a Christian," but also be a good person.\u000a Okay. So, you're the leader in this group. Why don't you poll each other again and see if they want to now delete other people.\u000a Okay.\u000a So, go ahead and ask.\u000a Okay. So, I put I'm not sure yet.\u000a We're still not sure. That's fine. That's fine. If we're not sure yet, we don't have to put it in one side or the other yet if we're not done discussing it. This may be one that the group can't agree on.\u000a I think it's a good thing to have, but you don't have to have it to be a good person.\u000a Yeah.\u000a I think we can just delete it. It is good to have, but people can be really good people and not be religious.\u000a Everybody agree with that? If you're still thinking, "No, I don't want to say that," this is the safe place to say that. Nobody's going to kick you.\u000a Because even religious people can also be...\u000a

V  I can go into group two because that--\u000a Except this one is like, these two are like, both like pop. These two are kinda like both pop. Because water's not bubbly. This one's bubbly and this one's--\u000a  Coca Cola. Or Dr. Pepper.\u000a  Do you have a secret rule to use?\u000a We're gonna get, like, one of those blue ones and that could be like the bubbles.\u000a Because they're kinda the same.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  And this one, like--\u000a  So, I'm gonna make sure I'm understanding what your rule is gonna be. Does it have something to do with bubbles or does it have something to do with it sticks to the side of the container?\u000a It's the bubble.\u000a Bubbles and stick to the side.\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, so one group is gonna be sticking to the side and one group is not sticking to the side. Is that right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, great, alright. Alright, friends. In order to be closer together, to really see how this is going to work, I'm going to ask Anagelia's group to very quietly come and sit in these three chairs here. Go ahead and bring your liquids with you.  Thank you very much. And... What we're going to do is we're going to set up our rule so that it's up here at the front. So actually, Anagelia, if you don't mind, Callie and Natalie, if you guys could scoot down just a little bit and then Anagelia's going to join you on that side so we can see this front area right here. Okay? Thank you. So, we can set up one of our groups on this table and one on this table. For your, what's my rule, okay. So, you're thinking of your property and you're going to put the ones that fit the property here and the ones that don't fit the property here. Who would like to go first? Who would like to start? Okay, so Ryan's group. Ryan's group. Come up and set up one that fits your rule. Just a minute, Ryan. Isabella needs to come with you. One that fits your rule here, and one that doesn't fit your rule here. Just one, just one. One in each. Okay, thank you. You can be seated, okay. So, we have this one fits their rule, this one doesn't fit their rule. I can tell Bryson's already thinking about what it could possibly be.\u000a This one can fit their rule.\u000a Hold on one second. That's where we're going, but wait one second, okay. Let's talk about what we see. Any ideas so far of what might be going on here? Bryson, do you have one that you could bring up that you think goes in either space?\u000a  The bubbles on the top.\u000a Okay, so you think it has something to do with bubbles. Do you have one that fits bubbles?\u000a  That one.\u000a He's got a hypothesis. Now Lena, he's got a hypothesis about what he thinks it might be. Do you think this fits the rule?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. So, now we need to check in with Isabella and Ryan. Does that fit the rule?\u000a  Yes.\u000a It does, okay.\u000a  It doesn't fit my rule.\u000a So, your rule should be the same as your partner's. Do you remember what that rule was, Ryan?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay, great. Alright, so Anagelia, thanks for raising your hand. Do you have one that you think fits the rule or doesn't fit the rule? Thank you, Callie. Callie, will you check in with Isabella and Ryan and see if that fits.\u000a Isabella, does that fit the rule?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Okay. Anybody else who's ready to bring one up?\u000a  Oh, another rule?\u000a Another one that might fit or doesn't fit. Rigo, would you like to try? Which one do you think would go with this group? Which ones from the ones you have would go with this group? Bryson giving you a hint?\u000a  No, that one doesn't. That one here.\u000a So, you think both of these fit?\u000a The blue one, just the blue one. Because look at this one. It doesn't leave white bubbles.\u000a Okay, so if that one doesn't fit the rule, where would it go, Rigo? Where would this one go?\u000a This one--\u000a Over here, right? Just hold that thought for a just a second. No, this one we said does fit it. Right? Isabella and Ryan, are we on track so far?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Okay. Anagelia, did your group have another one to bring up? Okay. That one you think fits in this side, fits the rule? And Callie, you think this one doesn't fit the rule?\u000a  Look, when it shakes. Doesn't do anything.\u000a Okay, okay. Natalina, do you want to take a stab at stating the rule for us? What's going on here?\u000a  I think it's the bubbles and not the bubbles because that whole group, when you shake it, it has lots of bubbles. That one doesn't.\u000a Okay, so let's go back a minute though because you said two different things. Sit on your botton, Rigo. First, you said bubbles and not bubbles. And then you said bubbles when you shake it and no bubbles when you shake it. Is that the same rule or is that different? Is the shaking part important, do you think, to that rule? Okay, so can you state it one more time for us?\u000a  When you shake it, if there's bubbles, it will go that one. If it doesn't go bubbles, it goes in that one.\u000a Okay. And Isabella and Ryan, is that correct?\u000a  Yup.\u000a Excellent, so the shaking was the really important part of that, great.\u000a  At least for this one it's weird.\u000a Right, because right now this one has no bubbles. But if I shake it, it gets bubbles later. Okay. Excellent. Can you remember which ones you had in your group?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Can you come and get them? I'm not sure if I can. I'm glad you can remember. Can you remember, Rigo, which one you put out there?\u000a This.\u000a -  No, that one's ours.\u000a No, this is ours. Um, yeah. One, two, three, four, five.\u000a I think you've got five. These ones are originally from Isabella and Ryan I think.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Isabella and Ryan, can you come back and get yours? Great. Alright, which partnership is ready to tell, to not tell, but to do another secret rule?\u000a I thought I brought a blue.\u000a Did you think you brought a blue one? You figured it out. Okay, Natalina's group. Can you put one on this side that is fitting the rule and one on this side that is not fitting the rule? Natalina, you want to check that one more time, make sure that's correct? Okay, this one fits the rule you guys told me about earlier. And let's leave this on the table. Anagelia, can you remind what the rule is? \u000a Stick to the sides. Anagelia, can you remind Callie what the rule is too? Go remind Callie. So, these two do fit, right? Alright, show us one that doesn't, please. Okay. Careful with the liquids, please. You okay? Alright. We actually got a little extra help here now, didn't we? We got two in this group that fit the rule and one that does not. Isabella, do you have one in your group over there that you think does or doesn't fit the rule? Ryan, can you sit on your bottom again, please? Watch what Isabella is doing.\u000a  Oh, cool.\u000a See if you agree. Ryan, watch what Isabella's doing and see if you agree. Okay.\u000a  I agree.\u000a Natalina, Callie, and Anagelia, thumbs up? Is that correct? Did she put it in the right place?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay, good. Bryson and Rigo, do you guys have one that you want to put in?\u000a  Yeah, more than one.\u000a More than one, okay.\u000a  Oh, three.\u000a Oh. Go ahead if you think that's right. I think that's right, Rigo. Rigo, can you tell us why you put these two here?\u000a Because it can bubble. Bubbles in it.\u000a Because they have bubbles in them? Does this--\u000a  Does not--\u000a Just a second, just a second, Callie. Does this one have bubbles in it? Yes, it does. So, it's not bubbles and no bubbles. You're on the right track though. Take a look again. Ryan, do you have one that you can bring up and add to our groups here?\u000a  Stuff on the side. And this one, it goes away after awhile. Maybe this is the rule.\u000a Thank you, Ryan. So far so good?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay.\u000a  Yeah. Let's bring up all the rest. Oh Bryson, you can go ahead and leave those there. You can go ahead and leave those there. I think we're okay, actually. If you have any other liquids to bring up--\u000a  This one.\u000a Bring them on up. And put them where they belong and we'll see if we can figure out what the rule is. Bring it on up, bring it on up. Ryan, bring that one on up and see if we can figure out where it goes. \u000a This one's confusing.\u000a Ooh, a confusing one. I love a confusing one, do you know why?\u000a Because it helps you think.\u000a It helps you think, exactly. It makes it more difficult to figure out. Would you like to consult with someone? Do you want to consult with Ryan? Ryan, come here a minute. Your partner needs your help. She's trying to figure out where this one goes. What do you think?\u000a I think it goes in no bubbles because no bubbles is the correct one.\u000a Now remember, we just found out though that bubbles and no bubbles is not the rule. Because look, this one has bubbles. This one, if I shake it, has bubbles. So, bubbles and no bubbles was our last rule. Okay. Thanks for your help, Ryan. Anybody else give Isabella some assistance here? Well, you know the rules already right, Anagelia? What do you think, Anagelia? Which one do you think it goes in? Listen to Anagelia, Rigo.  What's your opinion, what do you think? Does it go in this group? Or this one? What do you think? Even though you know what the rule is, can you help her figure out how to classify it? Rigo, are you watching? What do you think?\u000a  It goes in--\u000a  In that one.\u000a  That one.\u000a In this group right here? Okay. What do you think, Isabella? You want Bryson's idea? What does Bryson think?\u000a I think it goes in that one.\u000a Because?\u000a Because most of them kind of move when you shake them. But when you shake those, they don't.\u000a Oh, interesting. Let's try that out, okay. Okay, Ryan, come a little closer to me right now, please. We're trying out something different. Bryson just said the ones... Rigo, you can stay where you are, you're right close by.  No. Bryson just said something really interesting. He just said, stand on your own two feet, please. Thank you. He just said that these ones don't move when you shake them, and these ones do move when you shake them, and that's how they're classified. So, I want to just double check that I make sure that I agree with what you're saying. Okay, Bryson? Does this one move when I shake it?\u000a Not really, I can't really.\u000a Try it out.\u000a Okay.\u000a See what you think.\u000a It kinda does.\u000a Does this one move when you shake it?\u000a Yes.\u000a  Yes, okay.\u000a Oh, it sticks on the walls.\u000a Ah-ha. So, are you amending your rule? Are you saying that the rule is it sticks on the sides?\u000a Yes.\u000a So, this group right here is--\u000a  Ding ding ding ding ding ding.\u000a  This group right here is the one's that stick on the sides?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Ding ding ding ding ding. Ring the bell, ring the bell.\u000a  But we still haven't figured out, even if we know that that's what the secret rule is, where does this one go?\u000a That one.\u000a  That one, that one.\u000a Okay, Natalina. Let's take your opinion first. Rigo, we're listening to Natalina. And then we'll hear from you, okay. Go ahead, Natalina.\u000a I don't think it follows our rule.\u000a  It does.\u000a  You think it's totally out here, it's separate? It's not in either category?\u000a  No, I don't think it goes in this one.\u000a  You don't think it goes in this one?\u000a No, I do think it goes--\u000a  Because?\u000a Because it doesn't really stick to the walls.\u000a  It doesn't really stick to the walls. Okay, you wanna hold it, make sure?\u000a  Stick to the--\u000a  Other opinions? Other opinions? Anagelia, I couldn't hear you. Could you say it louder so the group can hear you? Go ahead.\u000a It should go there because when you move it, some parts stick to the wall and some parts...\u000a  When you move it?\u000a It sticks to the part.\u000a  It does stick to the walls?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  It's dirty.\u000a  Isabella, what do you think?\u000a I think it should go in this one because it kind of... It sticks to the wall at first, and then it goes down. So, and then doesn't stick to the wall .\u000a Okay, it sticks to the wall first, and then it doesn't, so you think it goes in this one? May I have it just for a minute? One thing I'm noticing that's a little confusing for me, if I look at this one compared to all the others, this is the only one that's not colored in this group. Does that make it feel like these ones are stickier because they're colored somehow? So, this one's not as sticky because it's less colored maybe? I don't know. So, you're saying it sticks at first, but then not so much after that. Can we tell how much this one sticks?\u000a  No.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a It really sticks.\u000a It really sticks. How about this one, can you tell how much this one sticks?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  It kinda sticks.\u000a  That does stick .\u000a  Most of it.\u000a Some of it.\u000a  That does.\u000a So it sticks, but it is--\u000a  Most of it goes away and some stays.\u000a Some goes away and some stays--\u000a

V Like the chocolate one with the strawberries that we looked at, that is going to serve approximately 24 people. So if you multiple that by two that's approximately $48 that you should charge if you're going to charge for your cakes. Now it's going to depend on did you really put that much time, energy and effort into it and do you feel like you really need to charge that? That's going to have a little bit of basis to how much you are going to charge, but that will kind of give you an idea what to charge for your cakes. Think about it too, serving sizes for cakes are typically two inches square. They're small, so when you are thinking, "But that's a little cake" well, serving size is tiny. It's not that you are going to serve them a whole meal out of cake. It's just for them to get a taste. Sculpted cakes like the catfish cake that we looked at, $100 plus. When I looked these up specifically for something as big as that catfish cake because it was a pretty good size catfish cake. We tried to make it, as realistic as possible and it was about this tall. So probably somewhere at $150, $200 level had we bought that at a bakery. The wedding cake, like Jessie's wedding cake that we've seen, somewhere in the neighborhood of $600 because it was a seven tiered masterpiece as well. Who has a question? Come on somebody has got a question.\u000a I wanna make a 3D cake.\u000a Okay, when do you wanna make one?\u000a I don't know.\u000a They're fun! So if you were going to make a 3D cake, what would you make?\u000a Catfish!\u000a Okay! Britney's making a catfish! Okay, Erica's making a dinosaur. Oh, my favorite. Piggies, butterflies, what else? What would you like to try? Penguin, duck, basketball, panda bear would be cute.\u000a A tire.\u000a Brandi, I wanna see your tire cake when you get that done. A monkey would be fun. \u000a That would be really cute.\u000a So you guys are starting to think 3D. We need to be thinking about your roses, too. Because we gotta work on those roses and get that technique down. Let's go over to our table, and I'll show you about making those roses. Okay, so when we get our snow day tomorrow I expect you to go home and practice, practice, practice, practice, practice. If it's snow we probably will get out. Watch Facebook, Brandi. Or listen to the news. That's how we'll find out. I always post it to my Facebook whenever they tell us. You guys already know about fixing your pastry bags, and this one is already fixed and it's all ready to go. You know me, I like wrapping it up. One of my just little tricks I like to use for this, if it starts getting sticky on the outside-- Which actually I know you have struggled with this-- these are not my friends. These are my friends. That's my first tip. My second tip is if you're going to use a plastic bag, take a paper towel and just turn it into your handle. And the other thing is, don't fill your bag so full. It really only needs to be filled to about halfway, maybe a little bit more than halfway, okay? Then what you'll do is you'll start rolling it down. As you're rolling it down, typically what I do first is I fold it in kind of at a triangle. Then I start rolling it down. The reason for that is so when I start putting pressure on it's got both those folds and then another fold to keep it from escaping. Other people like to do the toothpaste thing and twist. It's totally up to you how you want to do that. Either one is totally acceptable. Just feel what works best for you, okay? Then I make my little handle out of my paper towel. Remember on the tips. You will notice on the tips, especially the Wilton tips, has a number. That number is representative of how big the hole is. The larger the number the larger the hole. That works on the writing tips. Someone tell me what number is on that one. Okay, tell me what number is on that one, Erica. It's on the outside. Okay, yours is a number 12.\u000a Five.\u000a You've got a number five.\u000a It says a 230.\u000a Okay a 230.\u000a One.\u000a Okay, and why. A one what? A one M, that means one monster. No, I don't know what the M stands for. What is the difference though between this tip and this tip? They're pretty much the same thing. \u000a What would you use this one for?\u000a For big cakes.\u000a Or for?\u000a Wait, don't! I got this!\u000a You've got it, okay come on, Ashley. What would you use it for?\u000a  Borders? Borders!\u000a Yes, great answer! Absolutely. I'm telling you by the time you have finished your masterpiece and you're ready to do the borders, get the big ones cause you're ready to be done with it. If you pick one of these little teeny tiny ones, by that time you're sick of working with frosting and you're ready to do something else. But this one's just a number 16. See how tiny that is? Okay, rose tips. The bigger the number the bigger the holes. Also on your rose tip, make sure that the large opening end is going down. If this is awkward for you, all you have to do to adjust your tip, loosen it and then twist it around, and then tighten your tip. You don't want to tighten it so much that it's gonna take a pair of pliers to get it loose, okay? Let's see if I can get this back in business. Okay, you've got your rose nails. You're just going to put a little squirt of frosting, and it doesn't have to be very big... and I'm making a big mess now. Hold it down. Lay it straight down on your waxed paper and now you've got your basis for your rose. This is what we're gonna build the roses on. We have to make a pyramid of frosting to start out with. Remember that on the Power Point? The first one I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna rotate this counter-clockwise and make my little pyramid. See that little circle in the middle? That's going to be the very inside of the rosebud. Actually you could pull these off after you let them set up. Stick them on a plate or on a cookie sheet, stick them in the freezer, and you could have lots of little rosebuds to set on your cake. Just add your little leaves add your little vines and make you a really pretty little rosebush out of that. If you want it a little bit bigger, you just squeeze and rotate all at the same time. It's about pressure and release. So, if you wanted a little rose you would pull it off right about now. If you want a little bit bigger, we're gonna build it up. My frosting is getting warm, but that's okay. There's a little bit bigger one. It's starting to flop over on me because it's getting really warm in here. The more petals you add to the outside, the bigger your rose is going to be. Did you see that? It just about flew onto the floor.\u000a Could you tell me what this would be used for?\u000a Yes! That one is actually to decorate cupcakes. So if we had a whole bunch of cupcakes this is so you can do some really delicate work inside the very delicate areas. Like if you have them all lined up and you're trying to do them really fast, you can just do that. Usually what they will do that for is you know the little curly things that look like a little snake on the top? Have you seen them? They just go "shhhhh." That's what they use that for. It kind of is fun. One other way that you can do your frosting pyramid is just go straight down and squeeze and just bring it straight up. So now we've got our cute little middle of our cute little rose going. Yeah, it sticks straight up and we're just gonna wrap our little petals around it. There we go. See how cute that is? It looks just like one that you just picked right off my little rosebush. Some of my white roses at home look like that. That one is cute that one's a good one. Let's see if I can finish this off. We'll do this one tiny. The smaller you want to make them, you just add a smidge of pressure instead of a lot of pressure. If you add a lot of pressure you're gonna make a big rose. It is, it's getting really warm. Who has a question about making these cute little roses? Okay, and I know you guys are masters at using your little star tips for shell borders. All right, so lets see what you can do. I think you got your tables set. Who would like to use this tip. Simone? Do you need a rose tip? Okay. I'll come around and check on you and see how you're doing. I want to see your masterpieces. I wanna see a couple of good roses from each of you. Kimberly, do you all need a rose tip over here? Do you need that? Okay. Sorry, let me get out of your way.\u000a Do we just do one or two?\u000a I want you to practice your borders and I want you to practice your rose tips. So if you have a rose tip at your table you'll probably have to share. I'll come around and check on you and see how it's going and if you have any problems or questions let me know.\u000a I have a question. \u000a That is a good question. It should be but it's not. Don't use this one. This works best if you take your bag and just snip it and just drop it straight back in the bag. Because this coupler is not designed to fit on this particular one. I'll get you a different one you can try. Brandi, have you used the super star one that makes-- have you used the leaf tip yet?\u000a No.\u000a Let's try leaves. The big giant one? This will not fit on here with your coupler. You'll have to use a different frosting bag. Most everything else that's out you can use. This one-- actually you might have fun with this one. This one makes swirlies. Cool, it just makes lines you just zigzag it. \u000a All the star tips are right here.\u000a Err, not the star but the rose.\u000a No, I think all of them are out. You guys will have to wait and trade out with each other. Yep, they're all out.\u000a I just suck at this.\u000a No you don't! Let me see. Start with this, Christina. Hold your handle. Handles are our friends.\u000a Ooh, it looks like a square rose!\u000a It does look like a square rose, that's cool. Okay, Britney make sure the big end goes to the bottom. The small end goes to the top. Remember your angles, too. 45 and these to Brandi and I'll be right back. Brandi? Here.\u000a How do I make this one work?\u000a Oh, this one is kind of fun. This one quite literally is something you'd finish off, like if you're making grass you just kind of swirl it around. You can do it like this. Yeah, there are two lines. Like if you wanted to do ziggy zags. You can do circles. You know like that. It's all about your pressure. Oh! What happened? What happened?\u000a They're laughing at my rose.\u000a What's wrong with it? That's a good start. Keep building on it. Now remember Leticia, this big part right here on this side-- that goes down. There you go. If it's not in the right location You may want to unscrew this and realign this. Try that, see if that works better for ya. Then remember you're twisting all at the same time. You're making like upside down U's, remember? Oh, you did miss that part of the lesson, too, didn't you. All right, let me show you and then I'll let you do one, okay? What you're gonna do, this big one always goes down. You're making like an upside down U. Just like that. You're gonna U and turn it all at the same time so that it's a slow turn and this motion all at the same time, okay? Then when you're done you just set that aside and do another one. Show me what you're doing. There you go. Hold it just like that. That's good. Hey, you're getting there. You're making a pyramid of frosting and you can do it one of two ways. You can either do it this way or straight up and down. Just make a big glob of frosting, and turn this all at the same time. There you go, just like that. Pull your frosting off, there you go. Okay now that's a good start, and now you're gonna start making your upside down U's. Usually you have three on your bottom layer. There you go. You're turning it all at the same time. It's all about the hand motion there you go, just like that. Just make little tiny ones all around. There ya go that looks good. There ya go. See, you can do this, Leticia. There, oh look how beautiful that is! It is! Oh my gosh. That's a perfect rosebud.\u000a Thank you.\u000a That's it. That's all you have to do. The bigger you wanna make your rose, the more levels you put around the outside edge, okay? If that's all you want then pull it off, set it aside, and do some more. That's it. All right, you've got the techniques and you know what to do. I'll come back and check on you. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Oh come on show me. Show me, show me.\u000a At least it's better than theirs.\u000a Hey, you're getting there. I think you're doing the same thing that Leticia was doing. See this big piece. You've got it back. It needs to go down. If this is awkward for you and you need to twist this part of it. Just unscrew and re-navigate. Britney, that looks good.\u000a Wait, it is on bottom now.\u000a It is now because I just turned it. When you were doing it it wasn't. See how these are heavy on top? That's the reason. It'll be okay. Do you need some more?\u000a Is there anymore cut-out things?\u000a No, but there's stuff to do it. All right, I'll come back and check on you. Sierra, I'm gonna leave you in charge over here. If they need some help, let me know okay?\u000a Okay.\u000a Good job. Where are you over here? Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Star borders deluxe. Okay, so how are you doing? You're doing really good on those leaf tips. Have you tried any standing up? So you know how to do that? Literally you start here and you pull straight up on it at a 90 degree angle.\u000a What?\u000a Just like that.\u000a Like that, sometimes they roll over. The stiffer your frosting is the stiffer they are. See how you can get them to stand up? Just like that, or if you want them to lay on the side.\u000a If you go slow they stay up faster.\u000a Yeah, and it has to do with the consistency of your frosting, too. Remember what you put in it to make it a little bit thicker?\u000a Powdered sugar?\u000a Or you can do what? \u000a There you go. Sarah! Sarah, I have never seen-- Don't look. A big no-no. Oh man that's good frosting. Okay, all right yell at me. I stuck my thumb in it. I had to lick it off.\u000a It's really good by the way. It is. Don't do as I do, do as I say. That's kind of like momma's say. Ya know, I'm your school momma.\u000a It's not monkey see, monkey do. It's monkey do what monkey say.\u000a I'm telling ya, today it's Ms. Morris is doing something silly. All right, so Sarah show me another one. Show me some shell borders, cause I know you've practiced those. She will, she'll be-- I'll be back. That's cute. That's very stylish. Now, the tip that Ashley has the one that looks like the little grass that's got the two holes at the same time. If you're gonna do something real fancy if you'll do this one white and then put a colored one in there and do it back and forth it will kinda look like this. Holly, try it again. Try again.\u000a Where's the leaf?\u000a Leddy's got one of them.\u000a Do you guys have one? Okay show her what to do. It's pressure and release. Pressure and release. That one actually turned out really good. That one is a very good leaf. When you're working on your leaves for your cake this is what you want it to look like. If they start breaking off like this, you'll probably want to scrape them off. It's just a matter of the pressure and release thing. But those are looking really, really good. I know I'm gonna sneeze, too. Okay, maybe I'm not. Bless you. Hey Mariah. Show me what you can do. \u000a Oh, come on. Those are good ones. Those are cute. That's a cute border. Samantha, you're doing a really good job on that, too.  Kailyn, that is awesome. So, have you practiced at home yet?\u000a No.\u000a Why not? I figured you would be-- I figured you would be practicing every chance you got.\u000a No, I don't have time.\u000a What do you mean you don't have time. Yeah, Drew told me you're working on your scrapbook. Good job, Brandi. All right, show me something that you can do. I wanna see somebody make a rose. I showed you how now I wanna see them. Yes, I wanna see you make a rose. Make another one. Oh, Let me-- You can use my frosting. I'll bring you some. Look, you did it! So what is the rule...\u000a

V  Today we're gonna work on soccer special olympic skills, alright? We've done this a couple of times before. Inside we did it on the gym floor and the ball moved real fast. It'll be a lot easier out here today on the grass, ok? You guys are gonna be awesome, we'll have a good time. First thing we're gonna do is dribbling. When you dribble, I want you to use the inside of your foot, right here. Inside of your feet, keep the ball real close to your feet and dribble. When I say go, you're gonna start right here at the start line. And you'll dribble, stay in between these yellow cones, all the way down to the finish line where this other orange marker is, alright? Once you get here, put your foot on top of the ball and stop the ball. And that's when I'll stop the clock, alright? That'll be it, you just go from the start to finish then stop right down there. First time you do it, you may have to walk and go slow. Then we'll do it again, and you can probably get a little bit faster the second time. Alright, Taylor you wanna go first?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Show us how it's done? Alright, let's go. Wait till I say go, and then you'll be ready to roll, alright? On your mark, get set, go!

V In my opinion I think the grandpa shows the most leadership because he stands up for himself, telling the principal, "I should not pay $15.00 because then it wouldn't be a scholarship."\u000a  Okay, thank you very much. I like the way the way you show, you know, how much he pays for one day and not have to pay for the scholarship jacket. Thank you very much.\u000a I agree with Julia, because you should not choose people for, like, what kind of races they are or their culture. You should choose them for what they've been through like their hardest work or something.\u000a  Okay. So you mean they had jobs, they had work it was right to feel that. Very good, good job. Okay.\u000a I think Martha because she earned the jacket instead of buying it.\u000a  Okay.\u000a In my opinion the grandpa showed the greatest leadership because he was wise, and a great leader is wise.\u000a  Okay.\u000a I agree with Alejandro that the grandfather is the leader because he didn't pay for the jacket.\u000a  He didn't pay for the jacket. So you thought because he didn't pay for the jacket then he's a great leader. You think you know just because he did not pay for the jacket that's what made him a great leader.\u000a No, I think that what makes him a great leader is that he stood up for himself instead of just saying, oh, okay, here's the money.\u000a  Okay, so a greater leader should stand for what he believes. Is that what you are saying?\u000a Yes.\u000a  Very good. Thank you very much for clarifying that. Go ahead, Daniel.\u000a I was going to say that I agree with Jennifer. I think that a great leader should stand up for what they believe.\u000a  Thank you very much. Go ahead.\u000a In my opinion, I think Martha showed the greatest leadership because she showed wisdom because she earned that jacket by getting straight As and being a good student.\u000a  All right. Thank you. Go ahead, Lisette.\u000a In my opinion, Martha's grandpa is a great leader because a leader needs to be a strong person like Martha's grandpa.\u000a  Very good. So you need to stand your ground. Very good.\u000a I think that the person who showed the most leadership was Martha. Even though she thought she was going to lose what she had earned, she believed that even though the teachers, they, they, some wanted to give it to someone else, but some knew that she had earned it and she, she spoke up, not keeping it quiet and keeping it to herself.\u000a  Okay. So you feel a great leader, you know, she speak up, you know, when something is wrong or in the way.\u000a She shouldn't just keep it.\u000a  Very good.\u000a She has to tell someone.\u000a  Very good, good job. Go ahead.\u000a It seems to me that Martha showed great leadership because she did all the things that she did so she could win the jacket.\u000a  Okay, what are some of the other things, you know, that Martha did.\u000a She got, she got, since she was in first grade she got good grades and she tried not to get in trouble, and be a good student.\u000a  Okay, so that means, you know, she has worked hard all this time. Very good. Thank you. Okay, go ahead.\u000a I believe that Martha showed very good leadership because she wanted the scholarship jacket so bad that she didn't give up on trying to get it.\u000a  So a good leader, you know, she'll try to do whatever it takes, you know, to get what he or she wants. Is that what you're saying?\u000a Yes.\u000a  All right. Good job. Thank you.\u000a In my opinion I think Mr. Schmidt is a great leader because he was fair, you know, to fight for Martha and not the other girl.\u000a  Thank you. Who is the other girl?\u000a  Joanne.\u000a  Huh?\u000a  Joanne.\u000a  Okay, so Mr. Schmidt was fair enough, you know, to fight for Martha instead of who?\u000a  Joanne.\u000a  Joanne. Thank you very much.\u000a In my opinion it's Martha because she fight for the jacket and she tried her best.\u000a  All right.\u000a In my opinion I think Mr. Smith because even though Martha was poor he still said that she deserved the sweater because of her good grades.\u000a  Because of her good grades. Good job.\u000a In my opinion I believe that the one that showed leadership was Mr. Smith because he was honest and fair to Martha.\u000a  Very, very good. Thank you very much.\u000a I agree with her because Mr. Booney just wanted the person that had money, which is Joanne. Her father owned the only store in town. So, Mr. Schmidt was actually being fair.\u000a  Okay. Thank you for adding on to that. Now who is Joanne's dad? You know, because everybody was saying I could hear Juan, you know, when Juan said because of Joanne's dad. Who is Joanne's dad? How can we describe him?\u000a He owns the only store in town.\u000a  Hmm?\u000a He owns the only store in town.\u000a He owns the only store in town. What else?\u000a He's also part of the school board.\u000a He's rich.\u000a School board.\u000a  Huh?\u000a He's part of the school board so they had the decisions like, in the school, like, what they do and stuff.\u000a \u000aIn the story he gives money to the  school so maybe that's also why they wanted to pick Joanne so they got more money.\u000a\u000a  Very good. Thank you very much. Now that everybody has contributed, now let's look at the next question. The next question is this: what does Martha represent to you? Think about the leadership qualities that Martha showed. What does Martha represent to you? Not only the leadership qualities, all the other things that Martha represents, okay? Anybody can start. Anybody can start. Just jump in.\u000a I believe that Martha to me represents a great leader. Her experience and triumph illustrate importance in leadership such as never giving up.\u000a  Thank you for sharing that.\u000a She represents someone who will find the truth and will solve it. She stood up for herself and she listened to what her grandfather had to say.\u000a  Very good.\u000a It seems to me that she was a smart and outgoing girl because she worked hard and speaked up and no matter how you look or where you live you have to be treated fairly.\u000a  Great. Like that. Anybody can jump in.\u000a It seems to me that Martha is not a leader because her grandpa speaked up for her about the scholarship jacket.\u000a I disagree because Martha did speak up for herself. Her grandfather just told her what to say.\u000a I disagree because like, her grandfather gave her most of her ideas. If it wasn't for her grandfather she probably would've tried to get the money. But like her father said, I mean her grandfather said that a scholarship is not a scholarship unless you pay for it.\u000a I agree with Daniel because like, well yeah, I agree with Arkie because the grandfather actually had to tell the principal that they shouldn't have to pay for it instead of Martha going to speak to the principal in person.\u000a I disagree with that.\u000a I disagree with that.\u000a I disagree.\u000a I disagree with Daniel and Javier because even though her grandpa told her what to say, her grandpa didn't go up to the principal and actually tell it was actually Martha who went up to the principal and got ideas of what to say.\u000a I agree with Myra because it's true. I mean he didn't go, Martha actually had the guts to say what her grandfather had said. So that's why I say that Martha had most of the guts to do that instead of the grandfather. The grandfather might've said that, but she was the one that stood there and said it. That took a lot of courage to me.\u000a  Okay. So you know that was a great leader should be courageous enough. So I like what Arkie said, Arkie said, you know, I disagree that Martha was a leader and Arkie open up that. Thank you very much, Archimedes. Thank you all of you for sharing that. Any other person?\u000a To me Martha represents a hard worker because since first grade she worked hard to get her good grades and not get in trouble.\u000a  Okay. She worked really hard. Thank you. Any other person that wanted to add something?\u000a It seems to me that Martha is a  that proves that it doesn't matter her race or color, she could do anything the same as anybody else can do.\u000a  Wow.\u000a I agree with Ashley because a lot of people discriminate, like Mexican people or like Mexican Americans, just because their family or their ancestors came from somewhere else and they're not from the United States.\u000a  So you know what has Martha done to straighten that or to disprove that?\u000a She showed that who cares where you're from or who you are, you can always do your best.\u000a  Okay. So you know there was, Martha is representing to us that we can do whatever we put our mind in doing. If we really work hard we know that it will work. Is that what I'm hearing from all of you?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  That it doesn't matter what race, you know, if you work really hard you know that you can achieve. Thank you very much for sharing that.\u000a I really admire her because I know some people who have been made fun of just because of their race and it's somewhat sad because some people aren't allowed to do things just because of their skin color or where they're from. What I think is that it doesn't matter what you are. No one is bad except for the person who's making fun of your race. You are not the bad one, it's the person who's making fun of you.\u000a  Thank you very much. Any other person that wants to add something to this?\u000a I agree \u000a \u000a because in a poem it says you can't persuade anyone unless you have the courage to make them, like, persuade them.\u000a  Thank you very much. Now let's go on to the last question. Thank you very much for sharing. I could hear from all of you. The last question is what other stories have you read that share a similar theme with Scholarship Jacket. Think of other characters that have faced difficult choices or situations. Okay? So think of that. What other stories have you read, okay? Anyone can start.\u000a I think Crossing the Wire is somewhat similar because Pablo was Mexican, too, and they mistreated him and denied him a job. However, he worked as hard as Martha.\u000a  Thank you for sharing that. You call that Crossing what?\u000a Crossing the Wire.\u000a  Crossing the Wire. Thank you.\u000a I think the story of Martin Luther King is pretty similar to The Scholarship Jacket because they discriminated a lot against African-Americans because of their color, but Martin Luther King stood up for his race and said that we should not discriminate others because we're different. We're all the same just because of color doesn't separate us.\u000a  Thank you very much for sharing that.\u000a I agree with Jennifer, Martin Luther King said that it doesn't matter where you're from or who you are, everybody inside is the same and all of us are brothers.\u000a  Thank you very much for sharing that.\u000a I have seem the movie The Blind Side which is pretty similar to the story. Michael shows great leadership because he is an African-American and he is poor and he tries to pull himself up to be able to play at a Catholic school to play football.\u000a  Thank you.\u000a I agree with Carlos. I've also seen that movie and the movie has a lot of great leaders definitely Michael.\u000a I agree with Carlos because in that movie, Michael, from the beginning he didn't want to go to school, he actually had really low grades and the family he had, they're from another race, and even though he had really low scores, they got him a tutor and they helped him, like, reach his goals so he could play football for the school he wanted to play.\u000a  Wow. Thanks again.\u000a I have read The Outsiders, which is a story about two classes of people, the Greasers and the Soches. The greasers get treated real dirty because of their lower class.\u000a  Okay. At the end what happened? Did they succeed like Martha? Did they achieve?\u000a Some of them died.\u000a  Some of them died, okay.\u000a

V Has more light around him and it goes off into this huge dark hole through the trees.\u000a Why do you think it's more light around him?\u000a I don't know. Just to show that, to bring him more into the main point that you should see when you look at the picture.\u000a What is the dark force symbolizing? Why is it a dark force? Why isn't it, like, a bright light? Yeah.\u000a I don't know. It kind of reminds me of what Jack said. Dante started going through the forest. It kind of reminds me of his travel of starting to go to the layers of hell and stuff. Hell's not a very bright place so it reminds me of that.\u000a One thing, the light and religious paintings. Jesus has a light around his head so it might symbolize how he's pure or more religious. But--\u000a What'd you say?\u000a I said but Dante isn't pure so why would they highlight someone who wasn't as pure as like Jesus?\u000a Okay, so I want to come your statement in a moment, because Kailyn had something to offer. Why do you say he's not pure? Is there any indication that he's not pure?\u000a Well it's kind of an inference because he's man. We all assume that the purity is in God or Jesus or Buddha or whatever. He's not because he's man and men have faults. Women have faults. A human being is just not divine, I guess.\u000a But it says in the text that he gets angry with people who are not true to their religion and their beliefs politically and religiously. So he kind of is the most pure one. Not like Godlike but he is more pure than the rest, I believe.\u000a So do you think that's why Dante went to hell in the first place? To go see all the bad people? Do you think he was going there to learn a lesson? Or going there to prove that he was right?\u000a Because remember this is a fictional. This is fictional. So can a character... 'cause you're right we infer that man is sinful. But can a fictional character be perfect? Can be flawless? Can be sinless? And if so, is Dante trying to go a different way of inference. Is he trying to infer that he is, from what you've said, that he wants to find out more of what sins are so he can make himself pure if he's not already. So can a fictional character be pure?\u000a One of the questions I think was the three beasts he encounters and what do they represent. I kind of thought that they represented what he does or what he did and everything. Like a wake up call. You're going to go see all of these people who have done things similar to that so you kind of want to change your ways. They were reminding him what he has done and what he did because he was violent because he was in that guild kind of thing. He was considered a fraud by the other team I guess side. So I think it's more of a like he's going to there to see what happens when you don't be the best you could be, I guess.\u000a Who judges where you go? Is it the devil or is it a higher power?\u000a I thought it was the gods that judged that.\u000a Are there gods in this story? Do we ever hear much about the gods?\u000a We aren't sure about the gods.\u000a Yeah, really.\u000a Who judges where all these people go? Cause they're talking about all the famous people and the places they are but who decides that?\u000a We didn't really read the hell part as opposed to the...\u000a Yeah, yeah.\u000a So maybe in the other books it would explain.\u000a Where the gods are.\u000a And you said who judges where they go and everything? Technically we don't know what supreme being judges that because all we know is the devil is on the bottom eating Brutus, Cassius and Judas. But in the book, on page 41, lines 8-9, Minos is the one who discover the crimes and dictates where they go. So he's kind of like boss of hell sort of. Forty-one lines eight and nine.\u000a I have a question. Are their crimes so bad to the point that they go to hell or is it just because they made like sins or something?  Because everybody makes them so would that make everybody go to hell?\u000a That's what I find too \u000a Meaningful. But in their own perspective they are different\u000a Individual, yeah. So do you think that the layers of hell are how bad of the thing that the person did like how far? What do you think depends on how far you go down--\u000a Like, the pain increases?\u000a One of my questions are, are the punishments of different people different based on who they are or what they do?\u000a I think it's what they do but through their actions they can kind of be defined as who they are. I think the layers of hell go down as the pain and suffering increases related to their crimes\u000a Couldn't it be like their pain and suffering for all of eternity is based off of all the pain and suffering that they had caused others in life? For instance, in Limbo. All these babies that had died and weren't baptized are now there but they hadn't really hurt anybody so they're not being quite as punished as, let's say, Judas who's in the center of hell having his head gnawed on. He caused a lot of pain and suffering therefore we was given a greater punishment for what he had done\u000a So it depends on who they put it on.\u000a Yeah.\u000a So if they just keep it to themselves? Like, gouging out the eyes. That's not really hurting anyone else.\u000a Right. Where's the gouging of the eyes? Where did you just pull that from? What piece did we read where the eyes were gouged out?\u000a Oh, I'm sorry I got confused. Oedipus?\u000a Oedipus.\u000a He punished himself for it in a weird way. But, do you think that his punishment would not go as far because he didn't torture other people?\u000a Think before you respond. Think about it because I want you to respond to this. This is huge. I want you to write your question down on a piece of paper and then their responses to it because you have probably just now created a thesis for an essay we're going to do for the end of the year.\u000a Okay.\u000a So write down your question. Mainly she has brought up, just like I heard you guys doing with these pictures, a different text. Didn't you bring up the Odyssey with this?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Do you want me to write Oedipus specifically?\u000a Yep, write down the gouging of Oedipus' eyes. Where would Oedipus have ended up in Dante's Inferno?\u000a Okay, so pretty much--\u000a Yep. And I want you guys to answer and then I'll move on and come back. I love how you bring in another text. That's one reason I brought this picture in, so you guys hit on that. I love that you brought this up. This is real higher order thinking because at the end of this year our essay for you guys for the final is to bring in the texts that we've read and you have to develop a theme so right there's a good start. Okay, you ready for them to answer it?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay.\u000a The pain that Oedipus caused wasn't intentional. So I don't really think he'd be punished as harshly. I do believe that he'd be punished due to the fact that he did kill his father and I believe a couple other people during that fight. So, he would be punished but I don't believe that the gouging of his eyes would lessen any of the punishment. 'Cause, really, he didn't knowingly go into the incest and do that intentionally. So really, he shouldn't be punished for something that he didn't know he was doing.\u000a But he still killed somebody.\u000a He did kill somebody. And the gouging of his eyes, I don't think would lessen that. I think it was more of a pain in life lesson for him. Although, It did cause him a lot of pain, I believe the guilt that he faced caused him greater pain than his actual gouging of his eyes.\u000a May I clarify something really quick here? So you're saying basically, because she asked where in hell would he be? So f+irst of all, what level do you think he'd be? Gouging eyes or not, where would he be in hell? Where would Dante run into him?\u000a He would be with the murderers.\u000a With the murderers, okay. So you're saying that he wouldn't be any more in depth than that simply because of his gouging.\u000a No.\u000a That is just his own--\u000a Retribution.\u000a Yeah.\u000a He did that to lessen the guilt in his life--\u000a In himself.\u000a 'Cause the guilt was much more painful than him gouging out his eyes.\u000a And also, even delivering pain to yourself can get you in hell with, like, suicides.\u000a Right.\u000a 'Cause there's the whole ring where like people kill themselves and they go to hell. Or they destroy their possessions. I didn't quite understand it completely but it seemed to say destroying items that they had, I don't know, maybe a couch or something. If you destroyed that, you'd go to hell because they destroyed their own items.\u000a Right, right. In Circle Nine, and that's what important about this, in Circle Nine, those people that destroyed or  take from. You know, you have Canna after Cain. Everything is allegorical. Every part of Circle Nine, there's an allegory. There's Ptolemy, there's Cain. Everybody is compared or made allegorical in there for their sins. Because of what they did to humanity. Like Ptolemy murdered people in his-- In his-- He was a ruler. He just murdered people. Mass murders. So, he was put in there as a comparison to that kind of sin. That Hitler type of sin. So everybody in that level, too. Which would be interesting to see. Talk about some of our other literature. Talk about The Odyssey a little more.\u000a I have one more question about sin. Do you think, is everyone's definition of sinning the same?\u000a Actually, I don't believe so. \u000a We were just talking how everybody lies but how are some still in Limbo.\u000a Goes along with what he said was, "no, I didn't steal" so you stole and then you lied.\u000a Yeah.\u000a So you double dipped.\u000a So you half and did different things.\u000a Oh interesting, so what'd you come to?\u000a We came to they'd go to the serious one.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Whichever one's more serious\u000a Why? Basically the one thing that impacted the world more, like in a bad way, is going to take the worse punishment. So if I stole a penny, or I lied to the king, I'd probably get punished for lying to the king. That's what we kind of came up with.\u000a Yeah.\u000a So I want to ask you a question. If you're saying you lied and then you lie about lying, or you steal and you lie about lying.\u000a I don't steal, sorry.\u000a Yeah, they're two crimes and this person has chosen to commit two crimes. Okay, so does that play into that?\u000a Would you suffer twice the punishment then?\u000a No, it doesn't bring up any of that in Dante's. Basically everybody's got the same punishment.\u000a But still wouldn't you get like harsher--\u000a Well, depending on the circle.\u000a Yeah, but some people in the circles do have worse punishments than other people.\u000a Will you give me an example?\u000a Well, let's see. Ulysses, and I forget the other guy's name, they are in the same flame and I think he said the flame was burning brighter. I would assume that'd be a worse punishment than other people if they're burning --\u000a If they're burning, yeah.\u000a Some of the less worse... um... lesser punishments.  It's like magicians get their heads turned backwards. You could see where you've been but you wouldn't cry over it. Unless getting stabbed to death and then healing and then getting stabbed to death again\u000a Yeah\u000a Then your flesh getting eaten off over and over and over again.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah.\u000a I want to ask you guys a question because we've studied pictures all year long and there was one when we were studying Oedipus. And I don't know who in this group had this one when you were doing those folders together, but there is, what is her name, Antigone's brother's name that was dead...\u000a Polynices.\u000a Yeah, Polynices.\u000a Was it the one where she was like leaning over his body?\u000a Yeah, by the rock.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, now that you've read The Inferno, do some of those photos from some of these other stories and poems tie together or relate or reoccur?\u000a I can relate. \u000a Okay talk to me about that.\u000a Because it reminds me of Dante being lost in the forest  in the beginning and then it reminds me of how Oedipus gouged his eyes out and couldn't see anything and so he didn't know which path to take. He had to rely on somebody else. He had to rely on Virgil to get him through what was to come. Then Oedipus, he had to rely on Antigone to tell him where to go and trust her with his life basically.\u000a Nice. Nice.\u000a That's what I got.\u000a Well as I walk away I want you guys, 'cause I'm going to leave this here. I want you guys to talk about other literature. 'Cause you said yes, I can relate some. You just did. I would like for you to relate.\u000a All right.\u000a Okay.\u000a Okay.\u000a

V You're totally fine. So you guys will be using, I'm assuming a meter tape?\u000a Yeah.\u000a For measurements? And then can you take a minute to explain the balance thing again so we're good?\u000a Strength versus strength qualifies ten times.\u000a Ok so I like that you're making everyone go clockwise, everyone's doing ten, alright.\u000a And then see how long they can balance on their most dominant foot.\u000a Ok.\u000a There's a max of 60 seconds and no shoes on.\u000a No shoes on, ok perfect. You guys are good. Ok so wingspan, what are your units you guys are measuring in? Centimeters and you're going tip to tip right? And then what was the ability again?\u000a They'll take their shoes off, try to touch their toes. And then we'll measure the distance from their finger tip to the top of their foot.\u000a Ok, good. In what units?\u000a Centimeters.\u000a Centimeters. Did you say take shoes off or no?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Ok, cool. You guys can start collecting data. I'll come back to you. Ok what do you guys got?\u000a  Same thing we got yesterday.\u000a Recap me.\u000a Hair color,\u000a You were hair color. Why the hell don't you have something else?\u000a  I don't know.\u000a Ok, so here's my question. Cause I was thinking about this last night. You're gonna be asked to make a scatter plot graph of this data. How would one go about making a scatter plot with hair color? Ok, so you're gonna assign numbers, numeric data to shades?\u000a  Zero to ten. Or one to ten.\u000a One to ten.\u000a Yeah.\u000a One being the,\u000a lightest.\u000a  The lightest \u000a lightest. We should probably get this straightened out before we do it, right? And then ten being the darkest. Ok, before you start collecting it can you just give me a really quick specturm. Draw a line out so I could see where you're getting your number data. And then what is your characteristic? That was your characteristic. What is your ability?\u000a How many steps does it take you to walk backwards seven feet?\u000a Ok, so we'll probably do that in the hallway? Does that sound fine? Meter tapes are up there.\u000a  That's a lot of guys.\u000a So give me a real quick scale then you guys can start.\u000a Ok.  One and ten. So that's blonde and really blonde. And like really dark brown.\u000a So where would red fall in?\u000a Like me? Like right there.\u000a So you're gonna make blonde one end. The low end, are we all in agreeance on that?\u000a  Yeah and mine is like in the middle.\u000a  Ok, and then the other far end's gonna be the darkest brown?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Or black.\u000a Or black. Are you gonna have everyone taking data on that? Or maybe one or two people just consistently doing the hair color? You know what I mean so there's not a ton of variation? \u000a Measure their hand from first crease to their middle finger. And then hopping on one foot, right? On your tiptoe? Or no, balance, balance. And then once your heel touch into the ground, it's done. And your hands can do whatever you want.\u000a  Ok, are we shoe on, shoe off?\u000a Shoe off.\u000a  Shoe off and is it right or left foot? Right foot for everybody? Ok. Right foot shoe off on tiptoe\u000a Max two minutes.\u000a Max two minutes so the deciding factor when to stop the stopwatch is when their heel hits the ground.\u000a Or their other foot.\u000a  Or their other foot. So it could be either or. Okeydoke. So just a kind of a flashback to remind us. This has been a couple daytime span here. Our goal behind this is try to determine what we can learn from a fossil. So as we work through this unit we're gonna start building together pieces of information that help us come up with ideas about the past. We've been specifically, as I've said before looking at one specific fossil, foot fossil length, right? The idea behind this is that scientists put the pieces of the puzzle together, we start to get a clear image of what's going on. Again, our goal was to determine if there's a relationship between the characteristic you chose, the ability you chose, and a person's foot fossil. I asked you last night to plot up your data for both characteristic and ability and then if possible draw a line of best fit. That could be an indirect relationship, a direct one, a trend, or no relationship. What I'm gonna ask you to do for a minute, talk to your neighbors. Compare your data. Make sure we're on the same page in determining a relationship. And then I'd like you to come up and post your data. It's gonna be a pretty simple process to post your data. So for example, if group one, what was your characteristic?\u000a  For fossil length.\u000a Hand spans. We're gonna put characteristic on the left side so they're gonna right hand span for us. And then what type of relationship did you guys see for that?\u000a  Direct.\u000a Direct, so all you're gonna do is do this. That's all we need to report. Ok, in your lab packet, you are going to find some little graphs. You're gonna be asked to record everyone's data. I've also given you a supplementary sheet cause you're gonna need more graphs. I messed up and didn't tell you. So what's gonna wind up happening is all the graphs would appear on here. You will also copy down into your packet because as a whole you'll be looking at everyone's data and drawing conclusions, ok? So take a minute to talk to your groups. I'll come around and give you some markers. Determine what your characteristic and ability relationships are. Post them on the board and then we'll talk. \u000a No\u000a Can you determine it?\u000a No.\u000a Cause they're not. They're just kind of clustered. It was like more not clustered.\u000a Ok, so we're gonna have a trend fall in between where?\u000a I guess the trend really is between 15 and\u000a What are we lacking?\u000a You know what, it was 12:30 last night, Fossil, foot length, stride length.\u000a Ok, so we're having a trend falling between, what's our lowest?\u000a Our lowest is 12 and our highest is 23 but like the trend is between these ones. \u000a Ok, I think that works. So you're gonna give a horizontal line on your graph up there. Need help? Ok, whatcha got?\u000a  Would you draw a line for a trend?\u000a Yeah it would either be vertical or horizontal just like we did in the beginning. So this person's kinda like an outlier right so let's just for argument's sake take them out. Does that help clear the data up at all? You could say no, it's ok.\u000a They're all kind of in the same foot length but they all have different times.\u000a Ok, so we've got a pretty wide range here, right? For trend, we tend to see more of a skinnier range. So if you look at our options, it's definitely not a direct or indirect I would say based on what you showed me, right? Trend-wise, it's kind of a wide range. So what would we determine, what's our other option?\u000a No relationship.\u000a Yeah, I would probably go. So up there instead of drawing a line just write no relation, ok? Here's your marker.\u000a With this one, cause it's kind of like a trend or kind of just focused in this area. But then there's also the increase\u000a Ok, so here's my question. That's a good question. When I look at this data, right? If I had a pick, excluding this line, if I had to pick where someone with a foot fossil over here would fall, where would you pick? Up here? Why? Yeah, it appears to be going this way. So that would indicate that you have a direct relationship. It's kind of the easiest way to look at it. Ok group number one. Hand span versus foot fossil length and then jump height. What kind of relationship are we seeing here? Direct, so the bigger the foot fossil, the bigger the hand span. So just to clarify hand span, we're talking tip of thumb to tip of finger. Correct? Why do we see that? So I asked you guys last night to jot down some ideas in the conclusion section. so you might want to turn to that page, everyone, cause you wanna gather some ideas here. Why are we seeing this? Why do you think we're seeing that relationship? What did you guys say?\u000a Because your hands and feet are usually proportional in size. You're not gonna have a very large foot and have very small hands. Usually.\u000a  Ok. So I have a question for everyone in class. I bought some new shoes and I like them. Do you like them?\u000a  They're so big on you. \u000a They're a little loud. Don't worry I won't wear them on testing days. They look good?  What's the problem here? They're like way too big, like twenty sizes too big. How do you know? Why do you know that my foot's not this big? Yeah, it doesn't look proportional to my body. And exactly what Megan said, bodies in general are proportional. Now we go through some stages in our lives where we have long, really lanky arms. Or you might know someone that has extremely long legs. They're kind of fitting outside that pattern. But in general, bodies are proportionate, right? And so we can probably makes some connections to certain body characteristics based on other body characteristics, right? Because of this idea that we are proportioned. You're not gonna see Shaquille O Neal wearing a size three shoe. He'll fall over. He wouldn't be able to support his own body. Common sense applies here. That's a good one. Jump height. So you said pretty much everyone kind of fell into one kind of area but there's no indirect or direct relationship. Why do you think we saw that?\u000a Jump height is an ability versus,\u000a Ok, jump height is an ability, you are correct.\u000a  It depends on muscles versus structure.\u000a Ok, so it's depending more on muscle as opposed to structure of your foot.\u000a I remember the class like could already reach so that played to our height and the proportions of our body and then in turn determined how high I could jump in itself so I guess with your foot, depending on what size shoe you have, that in turn kinda determines your height because of the proportions of your body.\u000a By having them reach, guys. What was your point? When you set up your lab? Cause I remember distinctly talking to you guys you said you're gonna have them make a mark and then they're gonna jump.\u000a  Well it's so that the taller people didn't just automatically jump higher than everybody who was shorter than them. Cause then it's already the distance, like how high they can actuall jump as part of how tall they are.\u000a Ok. So you're saying that by measuring the height, you factored that idea in. So Mr. Bieber isn't totally outjumping say Adrian who's a little bit shorter. So you already kind of factored that in. Why did we not see a connection though? Megan said jump height deals with more muscle mass maybe? opposed to foot.\u000a  Cause everybody kind of jumped the same. There wasn't any variation. So it didn't really matter what foot size you have.\u000a Ok. So when you say jump the same you mean achieve the same scores roughly? They found the same general area in that same general pattern?\u000a  That's why theres a trend. It was all in just one spot.\u000a So in general when we're looking at fossils, would jump height be one that we could solely predict then based on the length of the foot fossil?\u000a  No.\u000a Probably not. Which kind of makes sense anyway. Group two. Group two didn't get their data plotted but let's take a peek. They did foot fossil length and height. If you were to make an assumption, if there was a relationship, what would you all assume would be the relationship? Direct, why direct?\u000a  Cause it's proportional.\u000a Bingo, bodies are proportional. You're gonna see that pattern as we work through this. Proportional, ok? Average stride.\u000a  We didn't really get a graph but it didn't look very direct. It was a little more indirect.\u000a More indirect?\u000a  I think so.\u000a Like this? So you're saying longer?\u000a No, no. Like there wasn't really a pattern.\u000a Oh so your'e saying no relationship?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Does that make sense? Alana says no. I saw this. Why?\u000a Well just based on the proportional idea, if your height and hand span is proportional to your foot length then your legs then, the length of your legs are also proportional to your foot lenghts and the length of your stride based on the length of your legs.\u000a So you're arguing that you think we should see what kind of relationship?\u000a  I think, a direct.\u000a You would say direct. Claire and then Barrett.\u000a Well, cause we had the same thing but a little bit different. And, well, backwards. It couldn't really be that accurate because it wasn't a very long distance. and people had different ideas of walking. Some people were trying to take larger steps or being more careful or walking slower. It wasn't just like an average.\u000a So you are saying based on the idea of body proportions that we should see a direct.\u000a But you're saying, you agree that we should see direct\u000a  No we should see an indirect.\u000a An indirect? Longer leg, shorter strides? Direct. Longer legs, longer strides. But you're arguing that the way maybe that the experiment was set up didn't lend itself to collect proper data?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Ok, good point.\u000a I think it was also just, I was asked just to walk like I normally do and I don't take very long strides. I kind of walk really slow so my strides are very small when I just normally walk.\u000a Ok so you almost felt it was kinda awkward like how am I supposed to walk. So maybe we could have captured it in a different manner. We could have designed the experiment if you're already walking and then you walk past the line and maybe keep carrying through that stride.\u000a I think no relationship is accurate because my stride length I would assume is based on how long my legs are. I have very long legs but everybody knows I have a small foot. I mean I'm still proportional like I'm normal sized but my legs are just a lot longer than anything else.\u000a Ok so you're kinda arguing that maybe you're not always going to fall into every part of your body being specifically proportional.\u000a There was a lot where some people with kinda smaller feet had relatively longer strides and some people with big feet had smaller strides. It was kind of just all over the place.\u000a Ok. So what are we labeling this? Direct, question mark, no relationship, question mark.\u000a  If we're basing it on the data that they had, I'd say no relationship.\u000a Ok, if we're basing it on the data, even though we didn't plot it. Looking at their actual data, we would say no relationship. Could there be a point where we could argue that we might potentially see a direct relationship? Yes. So for our data collection, we'll leave no relationship. But keeping in mind that very valid point that if' you're gonna have longer feet, more than likely you have longer legs. More than likely you're gonna take longer strides. But inherent as Claire said in the kind of setup of the experiment, that maybe that didn't shine through. Group three. Hair color versus foot fossil length. No relationship. Is this shocking to anyone?\u000a Yes. Even though they had a great numeric scale? Why? Why no relationship Bubs?\u000a  I didn't have anything to do with it.\u000a  It's like a gene base.\u000a Hair color is determined by\u000a Your DNA.\u000a Does your DNA determine your foot length?\u000a  Yes it does.\u000a  But not the same gene.\u000a Ok but not the same gene. Ok, now you're getting very technical, I appreciate that. Yes sir.\u000a I think its partially because \u000a Would you think that there would be a connection? Like smaller foot, lighter hair?\u000a  Well go on for like racial background like your ethnicity, Some ethnic groups are generally taller and have bigger feet than the others.\u000a Ok so maybe you're arguing the sample size? The idea that we were to survey globally, maybe we could see certain ethnic backgrounds that tend to be taller, would have different, I could see that. Yeah.\u000a Well, I think it has nothing to do with it because I'm six feet tall and Franco's under five feet and we both have dark hair. So obviously.\u000a  Yeah it's got nothing to do with it.\u000a Ok so on face value, looking at hair color. Would we say that foot fossil length would be a good indicator of hair color?\u000a  No.\u000a Ok, I would agree. There's no connection there. No connection. My question though, is. There are organisms that lived in the past. And we have very, I would say. We have certain ideas about what their coloring was like. How would we come up with that, then? How would scientists come up with that idea? Of the coloring of certain organisms? Caroline.\u000a Well if you say that lizards would be, or dinosaurs would be green, it would help them blend into their environment so you would assume it would be good then to be green but you don't know for sure.\u000a So you're thinking evolutionary connection. It'll be beneficial for them to be able to blend in their environment,\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Yes Claire.\u000a I think you also said a few days ago. About how you're supposed to assume everything in the past works how it does now. So if you see some type of reptile in the past it probably looks something like a reptile now.\u000a Ok, so again you're doing that evolutionary connection to modern day relatives saying well if they appear to be this color, possibly due to some benefit, we can assume in the past. Good, nice job.\u000a

V  Trying to find meaning for their lives, or were they just trying to, what were they questing for, do you think?\u000a  Well, Gilgamesh was questing for like immortality, and that was for him, and not really his people, but Theseus I think was, I don't know.\u000a  I think Theseus was just trying to help the people of Athens. I don't think either of them were really looking to find that, but they both ended up finding it.\u000a  I think both of them were like looking to help their people, and then I also think like a small part of them was looking for glory.\u000a  I think it's kind  of like looking for their destiny, like they know they're meant for something bigger, but they don't know what it is yet, so they're just looking for what that is, so....\u000a  Then he goes to take the test, and the test kills him. Or not. Then, he goes back to his father, and he realizes that he's just like, you know, the father's really disappointed in the son, and then he's really disappointed until the son, I think it could happen in today's society. I don't know about Gilgamesh.\u000a  Well yeah, it  was a really like--\u000a  Abstract, connecting--\u000a  In the really broad sense, it could happen, but like --\u000a  Like the story line.\u000a  But when you  look at details, then like, no.\u000a  But I mean, minotaurs don't exist. So it probably couldn't happen.\u000a  But like you  were saying, like metaphorically, it could be something, that, you know.\u000a  Like the storyline could happen.\u000a  But metaphorically, you could compare anything.\u000a  That's true.\u000a  Can you explain more of what you mean by metaphorically?\u000a  Like me.\u000a  No, the  only one was like \u000a  You mean hypothetical.\u000a  Theseus, not like he goes and fights a minotaur, and when he comes back, he's like not dead, but his dad thinks he's dead and kills himself. But it's like Haley said, I guess.\u000a  Thanks!\u000a  If you have like a test, and like you're bad--\u000a  Like a difficult situation  in general.\u000a  Yeah, and like your dad or parents or someone are like, "You can get through this," like, "You can beat it," and they think that you, or like they think that you fail it, or like catastrophe fail it, or they think you do, then they're gonna be kind of disappointed in you, but like they're not gonna necessarily kill themselves because you failed a test.\u000a  But still.\u000a  You can laugh if it was someone else.\u000a  But maybe like on the inside, he's dying.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Your turn.\u000a  Okay, I just said, what factors have to be changed to make this apply to modern times?\u000a  Well, the--\u000a  Probably the  whole like fantasy aspect of it would have to be changed.\u000a  At least like  in the... to the culture, like the gods and goddesses aren't like a, you know--\u000a  Big deal?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  I think that the gods and goddesses kind of like connect with like the people that are, not like in charge, but that are higher up in our society, like the government people, and like parents and--\u000a  I just think  more like mentors, in general.\u000a  Yeah, like people that are higher than us.\u000a  Like anyone  technically could like, you know, that you look up to, that you rely on for help.\u000a  It's like a figure, rather than like-- - Yeah.\u000a  A physical--\u000a  Yeah, god.\u000a  God. Yeah.\u000a  Well my question was, show the similarities and differences between Theseus and his father.\u000a  Ooh, okay. So, I think like they both kind of, they're very different in their terms of like loss and like failure. Because like when Theseus's dad like thought that he was like dead, then he jumped off a cliff and committed suicide. But when like Theseus like was with Ariadne or whatever, and she like helped him to like defeat the minotaur, then he just kind of, you know, left her on an island.\u000a  I think that, I don't really remember how he got in the situation of having to give the people on Crete seven maidens and seven children, but like, I just think that because that happens, and because he does that every year, I think Theseus is a better leader, he's just like better in charge of--\u000a  I think that they're  definitely like different rulers, too. Because like Theseus is more, like including the people like when he goes and like he led his army against Thebes, but doesn't try to like-- most people would like try to steal stuff from the city, but he's just going to like bury the dead, and then he leaves. So like that's more of a nicer leader I guess, whereas his dad wasn't really like put in that situation, but I'm guessing that he would be one of those people who would probably take stuff from that city, and not include people very often.\u000a  It says that \u000a  Because he lived  with his mom, so he didn't want to have a son. So then when he could lift the rock, then he could come over and meet his dad.\u000a  Is this question number--\u000a  No, we're still asking, predict what would happen if King Aegeus and Enkidu hadn't died.\u000a  If the king hadn't died, I think the son would have come back and they just would have lived happily ever after, and there would have been no like--\u000a \u000a-not formed, you know what I'm talking about? Because King Aegeus--\u000a  No, but he  would have died sometime, and then Theseus would have taken over.\u000a  Yeah, that's true.\u000a  Can you go, dig a little deeper with what you said about the democracy? What did you mean by that?\u000a  Oh, just like  right when King Aegeus died, Theseus came over and said, "We're going to have a democracy "instead of me ruling over all of you." So like, we don't know if that would have happened, or because if he just would have stayed alive, he could have like changed Theseus' mind and made him think a democracy was a bad idea.\u000a  Mm-hmm.\u000a  Yeah. He would've wanted him to be-- he would have that as king. He would've been more like his dad.\u000a  Yeah, that's true.\u000a  But if Enkidu didn't die, then Gilgamesh would probably like be happy, and then like, conquer a bunch of other stuff, and like they would probably like die together.\u000a  She could have sent him to Athens to claim him as his--\u000a \u000a  Oh, okay, nevermind.\u000a  You're allowed to go on.\u000a  All right.\u000a  No, if Enkidu didn't die, though, I just think that Gilgamesh wouldn't have really known-- like you know how they said he was really arrogant in the beginning? I think he still was kind of arrogant, until Enkidu died, so he--\u000a  He would have stayed like that.\u000a  Yeah, he would have stayed that way.\u000a  Mm-hmm. Because he went through like a stage of depression, so.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Do you think that each one reached humility at the end, or no? Do you think that Gilgamesh, you said, was still arrogant, even at the end?\u000a  No.\u000a  Oh, he wasn't?\u000a  Not after Enkidu died, but once he died, it stopped of course, but--\u000a  I think Gilgamesh was arrogant until he found out that he wasn't going to be immortal.\u000a  Well yeah, that, too. Because then he had to like live his life to the fullest because he couldn't live forever. He couldn't do whatever he wanted.\u000a  Who's your favorite character between each story? Out of the stories?\u000a  Theseus.\u000a  Yeah, I like Theseus, too.\u000a  We all like Theseus.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  It also said that Theseus was grieving.\u000a  Was grieving her loss, or his father's loss?\u000a  It was both.\u000a  Debate which character  had more impact on their society.\u000a  Can you say that one more time?\u000a  Debate which character  had more impact on their society.\u000a  Oh, she has the "debate" word in there. Okay, let's hear it.\u000a  I'd say Gilgamesh--\u000a  I would say--\u000a  ...he wants to be king.\u000a  Let's let him finish his reason. What's your reason? You think who?\u000a  I think Gilgamesh. Actually, I think Theseus would, because he changed the kind of structure of government, and made it democratic. That's it.\u000a  Yeah, I would agree with you there in the way that he kind of completely changed the government structure where he lived, while kind of Gilgamesh would probably be one of those leaders that is better forgotten than remembered, and memory lived on is not probably a theme in that story. While Theseus kind of left his ways and his story behind. That people remembered on high, rather than as like a low point of their society.\u000a  Weren't you going to say something?\u000a  Oh, I was?\u000a  I thought you were.\u000a  I think Theseus was, had an impact.\u000a  And the reason for that?\u000a  Because he like survived more than Gilgamesh did, and he helped people out of the maze, with Adrian's help, right? Yeah. Predict what would happen if the King and Enkidu didn't die.\u000a  Well--\u000a  I don't think  Athens would be democratic. I don't think the king would have done it.\u000a  Yeah, he probably would have been poisoned.\u000a  Why is that?\u000a  Gilgamesh--\u000a  I don't know, because--\u000a  Gilgamesh probably wouldn't have been searching for immortality.\u000a  Yeah, he wouldn't have gone on that Journey.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay, well my question is: how would you have handled some of the tough situations that each of the characters had to go through?\u000a  Wait, what was the question?\u000a  How would you have handled the situations?\u000a  Wouldn't have done any of them?\u000a  No, I get scared  really easily, and stressed, so that would not be good.\u000a   the Labyrinth thing.\u000a  Sorry, I didn't hear what you said.\u000a  I wouldn't go to  the Labyrinth thing.\u000a  Why is that?\u000a  It kind of sounds like a bad idea.\u000a  I might go and  just not defeat the beast, and in the first place, I probably would have traveled by water, and not just said, "I'm too good for that, it's too easy." Because, I--\u000a  Bandits have sharp swords.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay, what's yours?\u000a  Choose your favorite character and explain why. From, because you like Gilgamesh or Theseus.\u000a  Okay. Oh, not like our favorite character, just in the story?\u000a  Yeah. Well either way, it doesn't really matter.\u000a  Well because my  favorite character from Gilgamesh was Enkidu? Is that how you say it? Because I think he like really changed Gilgamesh for the better. And helped him and humbled him.\u000a  Do you agree with that?\u000a  Yeah, I agree with that, because I feel like he was kind of-- like Gilgamesh was so awful, and like Enkidu came in and just changed all that. Plus, I thought that it was kind of cool, his journey from like a savage to the civilized guy. Yeah.\u000a  I don't think that Enkidu really meant to change Gilgamesh, though, I think that it was just the circumstances surrounding his death that made that happen.\u000a  Enkidu's mom kind of made that happen, too, didn't he?\u000a  Did you feel like Enkidu was just kind of created, that he, I mean we were saying that we like him, but did he seem real to you, or was he just something created?\u000a  See, when I read it, the entire time, he just kind of seemed like this robot that the gods had created to fix Gilgamesh, so he didn't really have that much of a personality to me, so that's my opinion, I don't know.\u000a  Yeah, he seemed  like his pretty much sole purpose of existence was to balance out Gilgamesh.\u000a  And he did.\u000a  Yeah, he did.\u000a  My favorite character  from these stories was Ariadne.\u000a  Oh.\u000a  Well, because I  didn't feel sorry for her, because she helped Theseus, and like without her, he would have been trapped in the Labyrinth. But then to repay her, he just ditched her on an island, and just left her, so that wasn't very nice. So I feel sorry for her, that's why.\u000a  Okay, mine is: how would you have dealt with these situations in \u000a  Can you repeat it one more time?\u000a  How would you have  handled these situa-- \u000a  I wouldn't run away from the-- \u000a  I would not have gone  on this journey. I probably just would have stayed home, not gonna lie.\u000a  Do you feel like, that people, to be great, have to go out in the world and seek these amazing achievements, that that's what greatness is?\u000a  Not necessarily.\u000a  I don't think you necessarily have to seek them. It all really depends on what your definition of greatness is.\u000a  I feel like to get that like glory and all that, I mean, I think you can do that, if you have enough impact where you are, you don't need to go off on a journey.\u000a  What do you think, Dinesh?\u000a  I don't know, I feel like, if we're going by the definitons as you would see them within these stories, that obviously you don't have to, I don't think you have to seek greatness, necessarily, I don't think you have to seek it to find it, but I think that you do have to go off, if you're just going to stay where you are, you're not really going to be able to achieve it.\u000a  So if you just sit on your front porch and watch your life go by, that's not greatness. That can't constitute--\u000a

V What part of soccer you really want to know?\u000a What about the measuring or even the measure?\u000a That's what you've got to figure out.\u000a Or how long you can.\u000a Okay.\u000a I mean how many like, times you can do it.\u000a Okay, so you could sit there and count how many bounces, kicks, or you could sit here with the timing.\u000a How much you can do it and how much time you need.\u000a Okay, how many per minute. So, you've got lots of ideas. You're going to have to choose that. Do you need a little more time to bounce it off each other?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, so I think you have both come up with, all four of you. You guys come up with an experiment to support each other and you two come up with one. And you'll collect your data and you'll collect your data and then present it as a company. How about that?  soccer team or company. Alright? Alright, you've got a good name. Alright, that's part of it.  It works. Catch your attention.\u000a I know, Stephanie.\u000a We're having trouble.\u000a Because we barely decided on it. We didn't do the friction one, but  the one where you drop the marble in the the shampoo bottle. The little car that you pull back and see how far it goes.\u000a \u000a Okay.\u000a And the parachute one, so I thought of the parachute one.\u000a What do you think?\u000a Yeah.\u000a You're a team on it, okay. So, what are you going to measure with a parachute?\u000a \u000a Pardon?  Yeah, you're going to use metric, which is centimeters. Stephanie's got control of the metrics. So, can you tell me what your experiment is going to look like with these parachutes?\u000a Well, we don't know how far . Because we know we can't throw it out the window.\u000a Oh no.\u000a It's too far.\u000a Okay, but you know what...\u000a Maybe on the counter?\u000a You guys are coordinated, I would let you stand on this counter and you could kind of measure different heights. How high you could... You could do some test runs, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Don't you think scientists would do test trials before they make a real decision? Okay.\u000a Yeah.\u000a And you know what? If you'd like, if we have time, I want you to do test runs in here, but we could do a final drop off the balcony and get it clear.\u000a That's what I was thinking.\u000a Okay, but I do want you to do test runs in here first and then we could do a final. But make your hypothesis, what you're thinking because I think you're on a roll here. It's going to be good.\u000a I don't like his interview.\u000a So how far?\u000a In this experiment, can we put like some sort of weight on the parachute to see how fast or something?\u000a Okay, I think you're making another experiment, right? So, what's your first experiment?\u000a Just how fast it would drop by itself.\u000a How fast from one distance?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, so one distance you're going to see how fast it'll drop. And then you're going to compare that to from that distance.\u000a Adding weights to it.\u000a Okay, alright.\u000a Well, I wondered how far will the parachute go from different heights.\u000a Okay, so she's got one experiment and you've got another one. Do you want to do two in one and kind of combine it together? You do yours and you do yours. Because you only can change one variable at a time, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So, what's your variable you're going to measure?\u000a I'm going to measure the distance, how far.\u000a How high, different distances. And what are you going to do?\u000a \u000a And you're going to time it, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, and you're going to do, what's your variable that you're going to change?\u000a The weight.\u000a Okay. But you're going to see how fast it drops?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Alright, so I think you're going to need another paper.\u000a Okay.\u000a Because you've got two experiments going. Are you going to support each other in each one?\u000a Yeah.\u000a That's pretty cool, double points. How are you guys doing? Oh, I like it. Okay, tell me about this one.\u000a Okay, so we're going to get two or three different size basketballs, like a really small one and maybe a medium one and then... Yeah. And then we're going to like have two meters or a meter and like drop it from there. So, like how high it bounces depending on its size.\u000a Oh, so the size of the balls to see how--\u000a High it bounces.\u000a Okay.\u000a If it bounces higher  .\u000a What do you think?\u000a I think the small one will bounce higher.\u000a Because there's less material to like have to drop from there.\u000a Like when in gym class when they have the huge balls for exercising, if you drop a bigger one usually it doesn't go up as high and the smaller ones do bounce higher.\u000a So, based on your observations. You're a good observer.\u000a  So, your large ball went the highest and you thought the small one would. Whoa, are these your averages?\u000a  Yeah, they're my averages.\u000a Wow, okay. Good. So, how are you guys going to present it as a team?\u000a She's probably going to do like what we thought would happen . And I'm probably going to do the results of what actually happens.\u000a  Are you comfortable with that?\u000a Uh-huh.\u000a Okay, to make it really clear what you did?\u000a  Yeah, yeah.\u000a Okay, I think that'll be really good because this is great, this is great to show, and then you're writing your conclusion with numbers in it, I like that. And then you told, yours was rejected, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, now does that mean you're a failure?\u000a  No.\u000a Do you guys mind going first?\u000a Sure.\u000a  Because if they see that yours is rejected and yet you still could write up a scientific experiment, I think that might give them some confidence and it'll take the pressure off them because they don't really want to go first.\u000a  Okay, so let's go.\u000a   Aqui tenemos que cambiar la  friccion sobre dos.  Tenemos que cambiar.\u000a  Oh wow, the graph looks good. And your data chart looks good. So, Jenni will you shows yours?\u000a On the first dictation thing when we have to go up there, do we have to go up by step, like show everything?\u000a  What do you think?\u000a Or just show our graph?\u000a  What do you think would be the best?\u000a  I say showing the graph.\u000a Should we show like, our question and then should we show the whole thing?\u000a  What do you think?\u000a I don't know.\u000a  I think so. Showing both.\u000a Okay.\u000a But it's probably the most important thing to convince them. I'd definitely show your data.\u000a  Okay, we'll show his because it's better than mine.\u000a Okay, very good. And let's see, yes it looks professional. So, these numbers... How many times did you do this experiment?\u000a Three times, wait, four, three, twelve.\u000a  100, I don't know.\u000a  Because there's five and there's three.\u000a Okay. We've got one, two, three, four, five trials here. Is that correct?\u000a No, we went up three, but he wrote trials for these.\u000a  Oh, okay. So, we can fix that?\u000a   Que dibujaste? No tienes que poner esto.  Tienes que poner esto.\u000a It's very neat. So, you added one, two, three and divided by...\u000a  By three.\u000a  Okay, alright, that's how you got the average?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay, and who figured out the answer?\u000a Me.\u000a  Jenni.\u000a Wow, Jenni.\u000a We did, was it highest to lowest?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Highest minus lowest, divided by two.\u000a Awesome. You definitely should show this. And then this would be uncertainty.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a And these are the mounted distance with different kinds of... What are these five things?\u000a  The shoes.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  The shoes.\u000a  It gets tiring when you have to do it three times.\u000a  Right. Now my question is, if you didn't have the shoes how did you get the data for it?\u000a  I did it at my house.\u000a You did them at your house? Okay. And then what's this one right over here?\u000a  The socks.\u000a Okay, and that's one you definitely did at school?\u000a  Yeah, we did it here and we also did the Vans here.\u000a And the Vans. Alright, so that's good. Would you explain that to the class?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a That these you did at home and these you did here and so would you have any sources of error?\u000a Yeah, because of the surface. Like at his house it would have been not like floor, it would be carpet or something like that.\u000a  Yeah, what's your floor like where you did it?\u000a  Well, I had to do it like outside during the rain.\u000a Oh my goodness. Okay, so you've got to explain that and then do you think that would affect your experiment any?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay, maybe it would. And so what would a scientist do in the next time?\u000a Would have done it in a dry place.\u000a  Yeah, do it in a dry place.\u000a   Yeah, I like that. Okay, so you'll tell that for the next time?\u000a Yeah.\u000a But I really liked how you guys didn't give up. How you actually did the socks compared to your Vans.\u000a And you know how you pull those out what are  research, we could have done your boot.\u000a  Oh yeah, my boot. Yeah, I could have. Want to do my boot?\u000a  No, I'm good.\u000a No .\u000a  My legs are tired .\u000a Okay, I'm sure they are.\u000a  Well, did you accept or reject your hypothesis?\u000a Accept.\u000a  We accepted it.\u000a  And tell us why.\u000a Because .\u000a  You've got the evidence right there, don't you?\u000a  The experiment, like that one question we had, it goes with the real world or something like that.  \u000a  Could you repeat this experiment?\u000a The whole thing?\u000a  Yeah, or could anybody do this experiment?\u000a Yeah, it's easy.\u000a  It is? Did you write your procedure so it's easy?\u000a  It's hard to write a procedure because it .\u000a  Okay, and if you had to do this experiment over again, would you do it any differently or not?\u000a No.\u000a  Would you test for anything else?\u000a \u000a  Good point. How much pressure, right? Okay, alright, any other questions? Nice job. Thanks.  Jenni's team. Sorry to rush you guys, but we got the idea.   \u000a  What was your experiment?\u000a Our experiment was to find out what types of shoes would work to do the moon walk.  uses four different pairs of shoes like Adidas, , Converse or Vans. The Adidas would go the farthest. The Vans . \u000a  No, just show the data.\u000a You were correct.  And you were correct because the Adidas were here and the first time it went like 112 centimeters and the second trial it went 118 centimeters and the final was like 12 and then it was like 116.6 centimeters.  We accepted our hypothesis. Jenni, continue this.\u000a  Why me?\u000a  Because you're professional.\u000a Well, we were going to do an interview , but we forgot to.  So, what do we do? It's really bad.\u000a  Why do you think it's bad, Jenni?\u000a I don't know.\u000a  Esta bien, esta bien.\u000a Well, here's the amount of distance and here's the kind of  and I marked them as the average they all went. So, we can see that the Adidas went more than the Vans did because the Vans were like, the lowest. \u000a  Will you tell us about your source of error because that was interesting. Because you had a good way to solve it if you did your project over again.\u000a Oh, yeah. Well, it's because Jose did half of the experiment, he did it at home and the other part of it we did here and I think it did it different because he did it in the rain and we did it like on dry. So, I think that affected the experiment.\u000a  There's probably different traction on shoes.\u000a  Si.  Simon.\u000a  What kind of shoe would you try next time?\u000a A boot.\u000a  Oh, like my major walking boot .\u000a Si.\u000a  Alright. What would you hypothesize would happen if you tried my boot? If you look at the...\u000a Well, because it's soft, so I think it'll go farther.\u000a Possibly go farther.\u000a  Okay, alright. That would be interesting to try out. Does everybody see how this can apply to real life?\u000a \u000a  Tienen preguntas?\u000a  Hablan en ingles, no espanol.\u000a  Can you explain how this would apply to real life, if you aren't just moon walking?\u000a Jose?\u000a Jenni?\u000a Don't look at me.\u000a I don't know.\u000a  Go on the actual moon.\u000a  Gym class.\u000a  Yeah, gym class.\u000a  Does anybody change out of their shoes for gym class?\u000a  Sometimes.\u000a  Okay, some people do.\u000a  I don't.\u000a  You don't?\u000a  Yeah, like these shoes, they slide a lot like, in the gym .\u000a  Okay, so it might be different shoes for different jobs?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay, well thank you. Nice job. Good, we have time for our last presentation. Thank you.  Alright, sorry to rush everybody. I know you could talk more about it. Thanks for being a good audience.   \u000a Hello class, how are we doing today?\u000a  Good.\u000a So our title was dirty water versus clean water. Thank you. Our experiment had to do with a sailboat in four different types of water.\u000a

V  Does that include slaves?\u000a  Yes\u000a  Does that include women?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  So how are we supposed to take uneducated people's opinions when they obviously don't know what's gonna happen?\u000a  Because a lot of people in Russia-- I mean, if the Russian's knew how to read, they would write a song. If they knew what was going on, and they were smart enough, they would obviously write a song about it.\u000a  I think John Locke had one more thing to say, is that right?\u000a  Yes, okay, and to answer your question about the government. The government was created to protect people's rights, it wasn't created for you to abuse power and just do what you think you need to do, they are only for them, and it's not doing what it needs to do, then yeah, the people do have the right.\u000a  People aren't dead, so obviously I'm doing what I need to do, and I'm protecting them.\u000a  If that's all you care about, then that would just be easy not to let people die.\u000a  Obviously they're not having problems where their lives threatened. We have all these, like... If you're, wherever you live... Anyways, wherever you live, if your king or queen wasn't doing what they thought to protect you guys, and you had all these invaders coming in, then you could argue being mad at them because they're not protecting you and doing their job.\u000a  That's when you know they're upset.\u000a  Plus, you're saying that your people aren't educated, but they're educated enough to know what their rights are, and how they should be treated, so...\u000a  I mean, you can think you should be treated in a certain way, but I could say I think I should be able to slide on this floor right now, but I might not know if I slide on this floor right now, I'm gonna die. But because I'm not educated in that kind of way. But your king or queen is educated in that kind of way, so they're not gonna let you do stuff like that.\u000a  We're not asking for stuff like that, we're asking for our natural rights.\u000a  I know that they,   What's the word? The end result? Conclusion. I know the conclusion of you guys getting your natural rights, and the way that you guys are acting for them. In a way, I'm gonna get you guys what you guys need to get, your conclusion is gonna be a whole lot better than what you guys are hoping.\u000a  So what's the point of having your natural rights if you're going to abuse the law?\u000a  It doesn't mean you're going to abuse the law, it just means that you're gonna be more cooperative towards the law.\u000a  You're attributed to a beggar if they don't give you your natural rights. It's like a two-way type thing.\u000a If they give it to you, then you're gonna be happy about it, and you're gonna want to follow them and listen to them. Instead of trying to revolt and kick them out if they're not gonna give it to you.\u000a  Alright, so we say government is a good thing, bad thing, or kind of in between. Let's go around the room real quick. What would you guys say?\u000a  I would say government is a positive thing because it stopped some starving, and it keeps everything in place.\u000a  Okay, good.\u000a  We're in between. Because it's there to protect your rights, but if they're not gonna be there to protect you, then they shouldn't be there at all.\u000a  Okay, so it has to be done in the correct way?\u000a  Government is a good thing.\u000a  Any explanation why?\u000a  Because if you don't have a government, then you aren't organized, and if you're not organized, then you're, like, chickens would be in your home. \u000a  We think that philosophers, they write what they feel about us, and they don't do anything about it, and they don't understand where we're coming from. "You philosophers are lucky men. You write on paper, and paper is patient. Unfortunate Empress that I am, I write on the susceptible skins of living beings." Meaning that they write on paper because they can put out they opinion like that, but we have to be responsible for all the people in our country, and we're trying to do what's best for them.\u000a  In your opinion. \u000a  Frederick?\u000a  We think government is interesting because we need a government to be organized. But government also does a lot of bad stuff.\u000a  We think the government is completely necessary along with religion, because it brings unity to the people.\u000a  And I think the laws and religion kind of go hand in hand because... I wouldn't consider myself a Christian, but others probably would, because of certain stuff I write in books, that's why they consider me as a heretic, but the bible says, "Thou shall not kill." Killing someone is also against the law. Thou shall not steal is also against the law.\u000a  I feel the government is good if it uses the right power, basically for their rights and things. As long as-- It should be there, we feel it should be there, but it needs to be used appropriately.\u000a  We believe, sort of,  that the government is a positive. If you didn't have a government as a base structure for your country. If you didn't... The government perhaps is a positive. Due to the fact that the government, helps you if you need it to an extent, I agree with Catherine the Great in the fact that it sort of really helps with the territory. I've been interviewed by many people, and specifically saying, to many people I've said it, that I'm capable of saying whatever I want. So my country is there, and  I get to do whatever I want\u000a  If you were the king,  you'd do whatever you want to. Theoretically. Alright, Voltaire.\u000a  Pretty much, the government is an abomination. I mean, there's way more bad  and nasty leaders than there are good, lawful public leaders that do good stuff. Too many leaders take advantage of their people in their kingdoms, so I think they should just all go away, start over with enlightened, total... \u000a  What about slavery?\u000a  What do you think about slavery?\u000a  What do you people think about slavery?\u000a  What about slavery. Anybody have an opinion? Is slavery good bad or otherwise?\u000a  I wouldn't say slavery is a negative. then again, I wouldn't say  that it's a bad thing either.  I guess you could say, mostly slavery came from Austria due to the fact that if you get in trouble, with another country, and they sand to the Austria you're pretty much going to be a slave for the rest of your life. You pretty much work for them. You work for the Pope himself, and you work for the Roman Emperor.\u000a  Voltaire?\u000a  I think slavery is a necessary evil.\u000a  A necessary evil? \u000a  Well, we disagree  with , because we see everyone  as equals, and think everyone should be treated equally, and it's part of their natural rights such as freedom.\u000a  Exactly, that would  be considered one of their natural rights. \u000a Rousseau? \u000a  Serfs, which were similar to slaves, very good. Last comment there,  Thomas Hobbes?\u000a  I don't think we really have an opinion on slavery, but if the king decided to have slavery in the country, I think we should respect that and do it for the betterment of the country.\u000a  Respect the authority  of the king?\u000a  No piling up...  ...because that's what  slavery is there for.\u000a  Okay. Very good. Any last minute comments? I think we're almost out of time for our salon discussion. I heard a lot of good ideas. Does anybody have any last minute comments that they want to add? Yes, Frederick?\u000a  A lot of things that we have to say I didn't get... Three things of everybody's opinion. All you guys are really self... You're not sinners or anything. For lack of better words. And I wouldn't read them, meaning I would probably do anything to get support from my people, and I'd do anything for my people. Like my dad would do anything for me, he raised me well. And slavery and natural rights and all that mumbo-jumbo shouldn't be from you, because you're not them. You're not, just as you're not Voltaire, and I'm not Thomas. So you can't overrule anybody else, it's not right.\u000a  Very good. Excellent job, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending our little salon here. Hopefully we learned some new ideas, and got to hear some other opinions of people throughout Europe, so let's give yourselves a little round of applause.  Alright, you are now done with the salon. You can take your little parts if you want and put them up because you are no longer those people, you are now you in modern day times. Back to modern day times. But I do have some questions, we are not done with our discussion, but you are not longer your person, you are back to being you. \u000a We are not done,  and I'm going to ask you your questions now. Please listen. What was the purpose of a salon? We've talked about this from what you've right here. What was the purpose of a salon?\u000a  Exchange ideas.\u000a  Exchange ideas,  any other purposes?\u000a  Sometimes like, Joseph did over there, but to find out what people thought of you.\u000a  Okay, to find out  different opinions. Okay, maybe see something from a different side or viewpoint.\u000a  It was a devised to discuss music, who gets painting time...\u000a  Okay, so it has an artistic point to it as well.\u000a  It was just another way for us to learn about taking notes and stuff. Like research on our person and then hearing what the other people thought.\u000a  But as far as back then, is what we're thinking about.\u000a  Oh, back then. Oh.\u000a  Yes, you were right  about what you said.\u000a  Just to exchange ideas and go back until people like it.\u000a  Would you say there were effective back then?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  We haven't talked about results, we kind of left off talking about these people and how they talked about things and came to the salon. Do you think this is going to be an effective method of discussing?\u000a  The conversations we were having with them over there, like how they didn't think that we were listening to what the people were saying and how we were just gonna stay the way we were and stuff, but actually they got to hear our thinking about moving to where we need to go, it's gonna take them a little longer to get there.\u000a  Okay. Do we have anything like salons today? Do we have salons today?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  What happens at salons now? \u000a Right, so it's not so much political all the time in exchanging ideas about government stuff, but they're still kind of socialization and gossip going on. Is there anything that we have in place, or anything in our society today which you can discuss opinions, especially about government or problems that you might have in life?\u000a  Um...\u000a  Since salons don't really go with that, but... \u000a  So if you have a problem with your country or with the government or with something that's going on, we don't have a salon to go and meet like this and talk with people, but is there anything that we do that? Or any other thing? Another way to voice your problem, if your dissenting and you have a different agreement, or a disagreement with the government, or with anybody, anything. What can you do?\u000a  Don't we have press conferences?\u000a  What do you mean representatives? Write letters. Write letters to who?\u000a  The government.\u000a  Congress, the government, okay.\u000a  They also have environment issues and worldwide problems.\u000a  Worldwide problems. Okay, that's kind of similar. Where different people come and talk about their issues, their problems, and maybe how to solve them.\u000a  You kind of have different levels like, if you have a problem with, like, if it's about the school, you go to the school board.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  President, or people who are trying to be president, they have the debates on TV.\u000a  Okay, good. As far as being an average citizen, what can you do? Say there's an issue with the world, or an issue in our country, or an issue in our city that we want to see fixed, what can we do, you think, to maybe, go about fixing that, or trying to get that done?\u000a  Protest.\u000a  Protest. Is that allowed? Are we allowed to protest?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Were you allowed to protest back then?\u000a  It depends on where you live at.\u000a  Depends on where you live. We have a different government now, right? Back then it was monarchy, now it's more of a democracy. So what we're seeing here a little bit, a little bit different method and a lot more opportunity.\u000a  There's a town like...\u000a

V So, does percent always have to be 100?\u000a No.\u000a Because I see, none of the percents up here are 100.\u000a They're all lower than 100%.\u000a So you think a percent can either be 100 or less.\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay, okay. So that means you think this can be called an improper. Okay. Ian.\u000a Three-fourths and the decimal 0.75 are the same.\u000a What do you mean by the same? One's a decimal, one's a fraction.\u000a Well, I mean like they're equivalent.\u000a Ah. Equivalent. So, does that go back to what Alana said? Alana, which ones did you have there?\u000a One-half and .5.\u000a So you're saying the same kind of relationship is one and the same with  one-half and 5/10?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. Alana, no?\u000a Well, I did one-fourth, three-fourths, 0.75 and 0.25 because they're all part of quarters.\u000a Ah, you did one-fourth, what was the other one?\u000a One... Wait, one-fourth,  three-fourths.\u000a All right.\u000a 0.75 and 0.25, because they're all part of quarters. Ah.\u000a Okay, quarters. I can think of,  money. Quarters. Or...\u000a Yeah, 25 cents, 75 cents.\u000a Yeah, 25 cents is one quarter.\u000a 75 cents is three quarters. Three-quarters, one-quarter.\u000a Excellent. Good, good. Ian?\u000a Everything can be made a percent or a fraction or a decimal.\u000a Oooh. So you found a way to connect every single one of them. So everything can be made into... Say it again?\u000a A percent, fraction or decimal.\u000a Interesting. So you're saying that I can take this percent and write it as a, just a percent? Or as a... What else?\u000a Fraction and decimal.\u000a So, okay, he's connecting all. He thinks all three of them can become equivalent. From the views before.  Excellent, Ian.\u000a Six-fourth, one-fourth and three-fourth,  they all have a denominator of four.\u000a Ah, yeah. What does that mean that they all have a denominator of four?\u000a Well, they're all like, sets of fourths.\u000a What does a denominator represent in a fraction?\u000a The, um...bottom number?\u000a When we write it as the bottom number, when we're literally writing it, what does it actually represent? What's that for?\u000a How many equal parts it's split into.\u000a Ah, the number of equal parts it's split into. So let me go back to Ian. Ian is saying that everything can be written as also, as a fraction, a decimal, and a percent. So can everything be in four parts? What if it's in five parts? Does that matter?\u000a I can do the five parts as a percent or I can do four parts as a percent?\u000a Yeah.\u000a What about what Alan said? Percent, is it up to a hundred and that's it?\u000a No, depends on the range that you set it.\u000a So can you give me an example of when something would be more than 100%?\u000a Well, like, when something you did in Earth Science we did to see if our grow-dino grew over 600%.\u000a Good connection. Okay. So what did that mean if it grew over 600%?\u000a It, like, grew bigger than, times...\u000a Over six hundred times its size?\u000a Yeah, 600 times its size. Okay. So is it possible, so is that an improper percent? No, but we sort of get stuck into thinking that percent is 100%,  meybe we can't go over 100%. What happened here? You tell me about that percent. \u000a It's less than one percent. Is that possible? Can you think of a real-life example when you'd have less than one percent?  about growing something expanding over and over, to 600 times its size. Can you give a real-life example of when I would have 0%?\u000a When you fail a test.\u000a Oh. Well, I could fail a test with 64%. What does it mean if I fail a test with 0%? Other than I'm in big trouble at home. What does it mean? What would that mean if you failed it with 0%? What would that mean about what you did on the test?\u000a You didn't get anything right.\u000a Yeah, you got zero right,  nothing right. Didn't get a single question right. Can it be less than zero? Is this less than zero?\u000a Yeah.\u000a No.\u000a It's less than one.\u000a So where is zero here? \u000a Tenths is that zeros?\u000a No.\u000a Where's zeros?\u000a Between.\u000a Where would they go? Would they go in the ones place, tens place...\u000a Ones.\u000a In the ones place. We have zero ones. So is this less than zero?\u000a Yes.\u000a No.\u000a No.\u000a No, because it's 0.1 \u000a Interesting, okay. So, can I have less than zero percent?\u000a No. You can have a negative, but\u000a If it's negative percent...\u000a Can you have a negative percent?\u000a What do you think?\u000a Well, I was going to say something could be, like, one point, like, point one percent less than something, if you're comparing two things.\u000a Okay, your percent of increase or decrease, have you looked at that in Earth Science yet? Standard deviation? Okay. We'll talk about that somewhere else the percentage of increase-decrease.  I'm talking about a negative increase in or decrease in percent. And whether that's below one or zero. Okay, so can you give an example of where this could occur? Where I can have less than 1%?\u000a It can occur I think  with that fraction.\u000a Okay, but that's just a made up. Can you give me something in real life that I could have less than 1%? You can have an example of  more than 100%. So my question is, does percent go from 100 to one, or zero, or is there anything less in between? What do you think?\u000a Like, a gas tank in your backyard.\u000a Okay.\u000a Like when you call in to get it filled and it's really low. The meter's low, and under one.\u000a Okay, that's typically not going to be measured in percent, it's going to be measured in how many gallons for your tank, it's going to be a volume situation.\u000a Oh.\u000a Okay, but we'll talk about that. So let's keep that in mind. We're still trying to find an example when we have less than 1%. Think of one, Alice?\u000a Like, on the labels and stuff on the vitamins, less than 1% of your recommended day or something.\u000a I just so happen to have here, vitamins. You're right. And there are some examples when, if I take this, I'm not going to get my daily 1%, I'm going to get less than that. But there's some of these in here, ooh, like if I take one of these I get 100% of vitamin C. Now, I drank a glass of orange juice this morning, when I took my vitamin. What happened to the percent of vitamin C? Where's it at?\u000a It went over 100.\u000a Over 100. So, there's a real-life when I can get over 100% of something. Anybody get over 100% on a quiz or test ever? Over? And, how do you get that?\u000a Bonus.\u000a Ah, bonus questions. So we're good with coming up with more than 100%. But we're still trying to figure out if we can think of an example where it's less than one percent. So, we'll go back to that. Any other connections? Let's see if we can connect the ones we haven't done yet. Anything with the leftover ones?\u000a One-fifth and 20% are equal.\u000a Okay. Box right there. They're equivalent to each other, right? How did you know they were equivalent?\u000a Because one-fifth of 100 is 20.\u000a Okay, she did one-fifth of 100, because we think of, again we keep going back to a hundred for 100%, is 20 out of 100. Excellent. What else?\u000a One-tenth and 10%.\u000a Ah, what can you say about one-tenth and 10%?\u000a They're equivalent.\u000a Again, equivalent. Going to go back to Ian. Ian, they're finding the percent and the decimal, but there's no fraction there. Fraction with a percent, but there's no decimal. Is there a third for all of them? You said there's an equivalent fraction, decimal, percent for all of them.\u000a No.\u000a But there can be.\u000a The decimal would be \u000a So what would you like to add here, Ian? Let's go to the... which one?  You pick one. Find the equivalent relationship and see if we can find that third piece we're missing.\u000a Well, 150 and six-fourths is equal.\u000a Okay. Do we think they equal each other?\u000a No.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Convincing, but not yet, you haven't convinced everybody.  Do you think that equals...? Okay, four-fourths would equal 100%\u000a And one-fourth, each fourth is 25% and if it's two over, then\u000a I've got two-fourths left over.\u000a And that'd be 50.\u000a And they can also equal 0.5.\u000a So now we need the decimal piece. 1.5. What did you say, Alan?\u000a Uh, two-fourths can equal 0.5.\u000a So what do you think six-fourths, give me the decimal that I'll put here. We agree that these are equal.\u000a 1.5.\u000a Oh, so there is a decimal that goes there.\u000a How'd you get 1.5?\u000a Oh, because one and a half.\u000a Got it? See where the half came from? You said, Ruby, you had told us that one-half and five-tenths were equal. So, if we have that one-half here, we do the same thing, we combine it here to get the 50%. Okay. So, any others? What's the missing piece, Ian?\u000a Uh, you mean like another decimal to put in or do you mean like, another...\u000a Well, pick two that are equivalent and give me the missing third piece.\u000a One in one-thousands.\u000a One thousandths.\u000a One thousandths and 0.1%.\u000a Ah. Are these equivalent?\u000a No.\u000a Yes.\u000a No.\u000a You're going to have to convince them, Ian. It's the day of Ian convincing, I don't know.\u000a They are.\u000a Why do you say they are?\u000a Because one percent over a hundred... \u000a Well, because that's tenth, that's not thousandths.\u000a It's not one-tenth, it's one-tenth of a percent. So, here's another question then. Are those equivalent?\u000a No.\u000a No. So be careful. That's not one-tenth, that's one-tenth of a percent. So could one tenth of a percent be the same as one one-thousandths?\u000a Yes.\u000a Yeah, but when you divide it by 100.\u000a Ah, so we keep hearing, divide and multiply by a hundred, so when I convert from a percent to a decimal, or percent to a fraction, I'm using powers of what?\u000a Ten.\u000a Ten. So the question is: Is that the equivalent to that?\u000a Yeah.\u000a How do you want to do it, Ava?\u000a Um.\u000a Can you fill in the missing piece? Can you give me the equivalent decimal to try to convince me to go from here to here, with a missing decimal that I have? I have the percent and I have the fraction but we think we're going to get all three of them. Can you tell me what decimal that is?\u000a Um, zero and one-thousandth?\u000a How did you get that?\u000a Um, divide by 100.\u000a Ah. Dividing by 100. What do you notice happens when we divide by 100?\u000a It goes back.\u000a Okay, when we divide it...\u000a It moves two decimal places.\u000a And the decimal place moves two places over. So did that happen? So, are we convinced that these three are now equal?\u000a Yes.\u000a Can we see that now?\u000a But you divide 0.1% you divide it by a hundred to get... Oh yes, you're changing it back because you multiply a decimal by 100 so you have that. Okay.\u000a Yeah. Now that Ava gave us the decimal, is it easier to convince ourselves that all three are equivalent to each other?\u000a Yes.\u000a Because now you when you read that, you read it as what? One and one one-thousandths. So are we convinced that we can find an equivalent fraction, decimal, percent for every fraction, every decimal and every percent?\u000a Yes.\u000a So why do we have all three? Why not do everything in fractions, do everything in percents, or do everything in decimals? Why do we have, in real life, all three things going on?\u000a Alice?\u000a Because for some things it's easier to picture it in percent, in decimal.\u000a Okay, so picturing a visual to go with it, can you think of an example of one we use or, in real life?\u000a Well, like with money. It's like easier to think that it's going to be 25 cents or 0.25 than like, 25% of a dollar. Yeah, wouldn't that be interesting if they said, how much is that salad today? Well, it's something percent of a dollar.\u000a Okay, Ian?\u000a Well, with fractions, one-third is equal to 0.333 and keep going.\u000a Ah, so if we did with fractions or decimals, we might have some repeating...\u000a

V Yeah, I wanna talk to you some more.\u000a This is cool, that's probably how you attract them is start doing this. \u000a Hey, tell me why you think, Adam, he's able to do this again.\u000a Because he has these legs, like his legs stick to the ground so I think they can do it because they stick to the ground to get the strength, then he pulls it up and he does it again.\u000a Hey, that sounds like a connection to what we've been learning about the structures and the functions. Yeah, so when it's time to start making those connections, I really want you to write that down with your team. Just make sure that that gets on your paper. Okay, I want you writing out, how many paper clips is this beetle pulling?\u000a Two grams.\u000a Two grams, right now mathematician get busy. \u000a Okay. I'm gonna keep putting another one on here to make sure.\u000a Put four on there, let's see if he can do it with four. Hey little buddy, don't, don't, don't. No, no, no, no, pull him away.\u000a What am I doing?\u000a He's making a sound! He's making a sound!\u000a He's making a hiss--\u000a He's making a hissing sound.\u000a You think? Why do you think he's hissing?\u000a Maybe because he thinks we're trying to hurt him.\u000a Yeah, for self defense.\u000a Yeah, alright. Let me go check in with some other teams. You all keep working on your beetle.\u000a Okay. \u000a What's going on at your all's beetle team?\u000a He's pulling-\u000a The beetle is pulling two times its weight.\u000a Two times right now?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So how many paper clips is that that he's pulling?\u000a Two.\u000a Three, three. \u000a He's pulling three.   \u000a Your beetle's not moving. You think it's because of the loudness?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Class city class, should you be going to other team's beetles? I know it's fun, and I know it's interesting, but should you be going to other team's experiments?\u000a No, ma'am.\u000a You need to be engaged with your team. Okay.\u000a We're trying to--\u000a Okay. Did he pull two?\u000a He's pulled two and then we're gonna--\u000a He has pulled two? Okay. So let's see, let's just give him a little nudge in the rear.\u000a When I put a pencil right here, he'll go after it.\u000a Oh, well see if that works, do you think--\u000a I know, like earlier he was trying to get out of the bucket.\u000a Let's see if he can pull it? He's doing it. He's moving.\u000a Oh my gosh. \u000a I see he's moving some, but I haven't seen the paper clips move yet, that's what we have to wait and see. Are the paper clips going to move?\u000a Wait, I have to do my job. \u000a They're moving! They're moving! So he just pulled three grams? Okay, so... Did the beetle pull three grams? Beth, where's your sheet? Go ahead, help.  Talk to each other about what's happening.\u000a Woah, you can't hold him, you have to leave him on the table.\u000a Wrecking ball!\u000a Somebody pick these up.\u000a I got it.\u000a You hold him up, good, teamwork. You hold him up.\u000a You're hurting him, you're hurting him.  There we go, now we've got four paper clips on there. Now, lets put the paper clips behind him. Now... Talk to each other. Talk to each other.\u000a I think he's, I think he'll be able to pull many, many, many. Right now.\u000a I think the beetle may be able to pull-- \u000a Eight, eight.\u000a That's how many we have.\u000a Oh, this team over here has eight, I might need to go over... \u000a Woah, wait, wait, wait.\u000a Get a green.\u000a Let's see him in action.\u000a I am noticing that we underestimated our beetles, didn't we?   We underestimated our beetles, didn't we?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Our beetles may be able to pull more than we anticipated.\u000a We can do nine.\u000a Okay.\u000a Not yet, not yet.\u000a Keep working, mathematicians keep track.\u000a He's going. \u000a Talk to me team about what's going on.\u000a He can talk.\u000a It can pull nine times...\u000a It pulled eight.\u000a Its body weight.\u000a It is pulling nine times its body weight? Wow, how many paper clips is nine times its body weight?\u000a Nine grams.\u000a Nine grams? Holy moly. Did any of you all predict that this beetle would be able to pull nine grams?\u000a No, we only did all four.\u000a We only thought four, he'd pull four.\u000a We only thought four. We only thought four. Okay, are you all making any connections? How in the world is this beetle able to pull nine grams of paper clips? Nine times its body weight. What do you think-- Oh now look, when it's on the desk is it able to do it?\u000a No, its harder for him to do it on the desk.\u000a Why can't it do it on the desk?\u000a I think he might have a better grip on the construction paper.\u000a What grips better? What structure is gripping better on that construction paper?\u000a Because it has--\u000a It's because it's got, it's got like suction cups and I guess it's not used to the slippery desk.\u000a It has claws to pull it.\u000a It's pulling it.\u000a I think it looks really--\u000a It's what, Abby?\u000a Even though it's really loud in here its still moving.\u000a It's still moving even though it's loud in here, that's right.\u000a I think it just wants to go to Justice.\u000a You think the beetle's trying to go to Justice? I don't know about that. Are you gonna try a tenth paper clip?\u000a Yep.\u000a Yes.\u000a Look, look ten.\u000a Ten paperclips? Let's see.   \u000a He's taking your pencil.\u000a He's wants to get your pencil.\u000a Oh, why do you think?\u000a Because it's  wood.\u000a Because he likes wood.\u000a And what type of animal is the beetle?\u000a Bess, Betsy beetle.\u000a But what do they do? Why do they eat wood?\u000a They are... \u000a It's pulling ten!\u000a Why does the bess beetle eat wood?\u000a Look at him, I don't know if he's pulling ten or not. Look at him.\u000a Because he's a decomposer!\u000a He is a de-- He is barely pulling ten. He's having to work really, really hard.\u000a Yeah.\u000a I think it's probably time to stop adding them to the beetle, you think?\u000a I put max.\u000a Maximum is ten.\u000a Do you think we can add--\u000a Class city class, if your beetle is struggling and, like, arching its back and, like, flipping its legs, but it's barely pulling it, it may be time for you to give the beetle, we don't wanna be mean to the beetle.\u000a Our max was ten.\u000a Okay. So, we're left on, thank you for taking them off. \u000a Alright class city class.\u000a Yes, baby, yes.\u000a Put your eyes on me. Oh, I'm waiting. I'm waiting. Thank you. Most of us have come to the point where the beetle is struggling, okay? And having a hard time pulling the weight. At this point, if your beetle is struggling it is time to start the summarizer and the connector job. Okay, so I wanna hear you talking, summarizing, connecting what has happened. \u000a Let's give him a rest.\u000a Yeah, let's give him--\u000a Wait, don't pull that.\u000a Oh my gosh.\u000a How many is he pulling?\u000a Seven.\u000a Okay, here, I'll bring you some more. Where are the rest of your paper clips?\u000a Right there.\u000a Get off.\u000a He's starting pulling.\u000a Okay, oh be nice to my beetle friend.\u000a I'm trying to. He keeps on getting his foot stuck to my hand.\u000a Hi little buddy. Oh, I almost touched it! \u000a We learned before that beetles...\u000a Hang on, you're learning that beetles what?\u000a That beetles are really strong, but with their little legs and their thorax maybe.\u000a Their thorax you think is what makes them really strong?\u000a Because the thorax, it may be the biggest part in their body.\u000a Yeah, it is probably the biggest part. What else on their legs, what on their legs are helping it?\u000a Their... Look at it. I know what it is. Their...\u000a The thing that's sticking to the table and helping it move faster.\u000a Okay, so the sticky part on their feet?\u000a Here, let me do it.\u000a Yeah, okay.\u000a You all have done a really nice job noticing what structures of this beetle are helping it to be so strong. How do you think it uses that in the wild? Like out in nature? How do you think it uses that?\u000a It's functional and it almost-- \u000a You may even think it's cool, but he could use his wings to fly away.\u000a Some beetles do have wings to fly away, but what do you think is, I need you in your seat Nathan, what do you think it's using to move? Its, that's a lot of strength.\u000a Its abdomen?\u000a Right, okay, its abdomen is, but in nature. What might it use that for?\u000a It might use it to catch its prey maybe.\u000a Okay, what does it... What does it do? What does it eat?\u000a It may eat...\u000a Casey, say it again to your team.\u000a Organic and it breaks it down.\u000a It breaks it down. What is that called? What type of insect would--\u000a It's a, it's a d...\u000a A d... A d... \u000a A d...\u000a A D.\u000a A disposer.\u000a Not a disposer, close.\u000a A decomposer.\u000a That's it!  Not a disposer, but a decomposer, good. And so okay think, it's okay. Think about if it was trying to dig into the wood of a tree. Wouldn't it have to be really strong?\u000a It can make a hole.\u000a In the wood of the tree.\u000a That little thing, the little... might be to decompose the wood.\u000a So it can bite and then break down.\u000a It's really gonna have to be biting harder.\u000a Yeah, that mouth part is really strong to bite. Okay, so now may I have your attention, how many do you have?\u000a We have 10.\u000a You have 10 and it's pulling it, let's send him home.\u000a I want 11. \u000a They're moving, look at his legs how hard they're trying to pull. You might, he might be able to pull 11.\u000a I'm gonna give him one extra.\u000a No!\u000a No 12.\u000a Okay, you all keep working on that, you're doing a great job.\u000a Thank you.\u000a I wanna come back to my very first team.\u000a Carrying 10.\u000a 10?\u000a Ours can carry 11.\u000a Yeah.\u000a It did?\u000a Yeah.\u000a And he pooped on the paper.\u000a Okay, it pooped?\u000a Twice.\u000a It pooped twice?\u000a Yeah, twice.\u000a Okay, let me put this here. I don't know where to put it. There we go. So what are you doing? Are you adding 11?\u000a We're gonna see our 11 puller.\u000a You're gonna do 11? What connections can you make?\u000a The legs are like a crayfish.\u000a The legs are like a crayfish?\u000a Yeah.\u000a How?\u000a They have joints.\u000a They're jointed. How do you think those joints help that beetle to pull 11 times its body weight?\u000a The beetle is like a, able to grab on.\u000a Yes, so, Tim's saying something, say it loud.\u000a It helps it walk.\u000a It helps it walk, but--\u000a And escape from predators.\u000a And escape from predators, how?\u000a Because--\u000a What might it do with those powerful legs? What did we notice them doing in their containers?

Alright we could ask our teachers to what?\u000a  They get a walk!\u000a  To take a walk. Sometimes we may just need to to get out of our classroom and that is okay.\u000a  You're loud.\u000a  That was loud, You're right.\u000a  You screamed.\u000a But you know what, I like how you used your words and told him. You told him that you were screaming and that hurt my ears. Alright, using your words--\u000a  I did.\u000a  You did too. Alright what's our last one, we can. . .\u000a  One, two...\u000a  Numbers!\u000a  We can stop and...\u000a  Count!\u000a  Count. We count to ten.\u000a  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.\u000a  It makes my teachers happy when I am calm and not mad.\u000a

V \u000a  Starter-stopper, opposite side. Okay. Everybody has their marbles. How many trials are we doing?\u000a  Five.\u000a  Five trials. If the first one doesn't work, raise your hand. I will come help you and we'll talk about why it doesn't work and what we're gonna do to change it. What you're gonna do to change it. Okay? Timers. Get your people ready. Remember you're gonna say, "Ready, set," as soon as that: "go." All right. Go.\u000a  Ready. Set. Go.\u000a  Oh! You're supposed to get it.\u000a  Right here. This great piling direction. Did y'all's work?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Good. Good. Did you record the time?\u000a  Look.\u000a  Tell him. You guys are ready to keep going. Five trials. Good job. And we'll discuss why yours worked in a minute.\u000a  We gonna take-\u000a  Okay hang on. Tell me what happened.\u000a  When it got here, it stopped.\u000a  It stopped. Why did--\u000a  Friction.\u000a  Okay, the--\u000a  Probably because the speed wasn't great enough.\u000a Okay. So you think you needed more speed?\u000a  No. I think we need to take this off.\u000a  Okay. Let's try taking that off. Where do you think you can put those to get more speed?\u000a  Up here.\u000a  Ok. Now, what is that gonna give the marbles?\u000a  More momentum?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Let's make it bigger. Three centimeters.\u000a  Is this our second one? Are we gonna do a second try?\u000a  You're going back to your first one because you want to make sure it works. So reset it. Okay. Try again. \u000a  Did it work?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Let's discuss why did it work this time?\u000a  Look how we gave them these.\u000a  By doing what?\u000a  By um. Making it higher.\u000a  Elevation? Ooh. And what's another word that--\u000a  Altitude.\u000a  Yeah. That's good. Okay. So it worked. How long did it take?\u000a  Seven seconds.\u000a  Face the recorder. Got it? Okay. Very good. Keep going. You're ready for your second trial. Okay.\u000a  We're done.\u000a  Y'all already done five trials? Okay. Well, let's just stop for a minute. What comes down. Let's pull together here. Let's talk. I want you guys to talk about why you think it worked.\u000a  Because the big hill helped.\u000a  The hill? What force is that?\u000a  The hill was enormous so it gave it more momentum.\u000a Good job. So gravity pulled it down.\u000a  What did you say?\u000a  I said the hill's bigger  than the hoop so it gave it more momentum so it would go.\u000a  To make it through the loop. Right. And the force pulling it down was what?\u000a  Gravity.\u000a  Gravity. Good. Now talk to me about the order that you put it in. Why would you-- you kind of just did.\u000a  We put the hill here so the hill would go faster to go in the loop.\u000a  To get more speed behind it. Good.\u000a  And the turn would--\u000a  Make it slow down.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So what do you think would make the marble stop down there at the end?\u000a  Friction.\u000a  Friction. Okay. Very good. We got all five trials. You guys need a knee. Start recording your information.\u000a  It went really fast.\u000a  "Really fast."\u000a Just three seconds.\u000a Did it work on the first trial?\u000a  No.\u000a  Okay. Tell me what happened on the first trial.\u000a It was like that. And it just went off right here.\u000a  Okay. Why do you think it fell off? What was going on right here to make it fall?\u000a  Twist?\u000a  There was a twist in it? So you just had to fix it so that it went straighter. And so you pushed it?\u000a  Renny put it  like this, like around here.\u000a  Pushed it in.\u000a  So it might have been a little to steep too. That incline might have been too steep. What order did you put your elements in?\u000a  Hill, loop, and turn.\u000a  Okay. And why'd you put the hill first?\u000a  Because it's higher. And it would give more speed.\u000a  What force is giving it more speed right here?\u000a  Gravity.\u000a  Very good. Okay. And then talk to me about why you put your loop right after that hill and not your turn. Why didn't you put your turn there?\u000a  If we turn, there's not enough speed.\u000a  For the loop.\u000a  Okay. Y'all both said the exact same thing. Repeat that to me so I understand.\u000a  If we put the turn first, it won't have enough speed for the loop.\u000a  Good. Very good. All right. Good job guys. Have you got five trials?\u000a  It's all three seconds.\u000a  All of 'em were the same? That's interesting. Very good. We'll talk about that after you each need a knee and record your information. Anthony, what was your job?\u000a  Record.\u000a  So you were the one that found that they were the same each time? Make sure you get written down everything. Okay guys. Talk to me.\u000a  We got three.\u000a  Did the first one work?\u000a  No.\u000a  Tell me what happened on the first one becuase I didn't see it.\u000a  The first one, we had this open and we had it sitting right there and we had the chair right here and when we set it down, right here, when the chair was right there, it kept on falling off.\u000a  So it just dropped.\u000a  So you think the incline was too what?\u000a  Straight.\u000a  It was too steep.\u000a  There you go. That's the word I'm looking for. It was too steep.\u000a  Because it was right here and it was going all down.\u000a  Very Good. So what did you do to fix it?\u000a  We kept on sliding  it down a little.\u000a  Did you have to slide it down more than once?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Good job guys. So did you get it to where you could do five trials?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  And we got three for each.\u000a  Three seconds? They did too. They got the exact same for all of 'em. How about that? But look at your coasters. They look different.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  That's interesting too. 'Cause their incline is steeper than yours. Lets talk about the order that you have your elements in. What's first?\u000a  The hill because it gives more speed when it's going down a hill so you don't--\u000a  But that's on what force?\u000a  Gravity.\u000a  Good job. And why'd you put your loop right after that?\u000a  Because it would have the most speed to keep going and then the turn return it. Because if we did the turn, it wouldn't have enough speed to make the loop.\u000a  Good job. Good job. Need a knee, record your information, and start figuring your speed. Have you guys got all five trials?\u000a  Nope.\u000a  Uh oh. What happened?\u000a  It stopped because of the friction. When it get right here, it started getting out of friction.\u000a  Friction right here? What's causing friction right here? Can I watch it?\u000a  Its gonna work this time because we taped it down.\u000a  Why do you think it's gonna work?\u000a  Because we taped it down.\u000a  You know what? I want you to use that one. How long did that take?\u000a  Seven.\u000a  Seven seconds? All right. Do it again. Let's look at it again. So it was stopping right here.\u000a  It always was stopping right there and then I taped it down.\u000a  Oh you taped this down.\u000a  That thing could be higher.\u000a  Okay. I think you should try that.\u000a  We can use this clock. No we need some more.\u000a  I was gonna get one of them books.\u000a  Guys, you can use any state. So what are you doing to the hills?\u000a  Making it bigger.\u000a  So the speed will go more faster.\u000a  More faster? So that it'll increase the speed? All right. Let's see what happens. Let's see if this one works.\u000a  Angel, what are you doing?\u000a  Timing. Ready? One-- Oh.\u000a  We use good team work.\u000a  You are using good teamwork. I'm proud of it.\u000a  Ready? Set. Go.\u000a  It didn't start  from the beginning.\u000a  I did not start that one.\u000a  Let me ask you this. Just to give you a different idea because you've already tried to change in the elevation of your hill.\u000a  Maybe how big the loop is.\u000a  How do you think that'll help?\u000a So the-- will go faster and will make it go through.\u000a  All right. We're gonna try this. Help her out guys. So we're making the loop smaller and that's gonna -- So now you might want to move this up a little bit there. You see how this is gonna have to go -- There you go.\u000a  What about your taping? If it's -- will the --\u000a  Yeah. Let's try again. Wait. We were gonna time that, honey. Now you're ready to go. So what was the solution to your problem?\u000a  To make the loop smaller so it would go through much faster.\u000a  All right. Good job. Now you're ready to time five trials.\u000a  Ready? Go.\u000a  Look, how beautiful. Good job, guys.\u000a  How many seconds?\u000a  Four.\u000a  Four seconds. That's good. How many trials?\u000a  Three. We got two more.\u000a  I want to know. You got three seconds on each one. So your speed was the same. Where did your distance come from?\u000a  We did how many feet and then we found out how many inches.\u000a  And times it by 18 because it's 18 on there.\u000a  How long was each tube?\u000a  Six feet.\u000a  Six feet. How many inches is that? Let's work it out. Make sure you've got it right on here.\u000a  72.\u000a  So, you've got 72 inches.\u000a  We only did one tube.\u000a  And how many tubes are there?\u000a  There's three tubes.\u000a  So 72. What would you do next?\u000a  Times three.\u000a  Yes. 72 times three. How did you guys get 216? You did 18 inches instead of six? I mean 12. Okay. So now you'll have to go back and redo your speed. Figure in your speed. So how do you find speed?\u000a  I still got 216.\u000a  Well then you were right. That's right. So you guys are ready to go on to make a graph. Let's talk about the graph you're gonna make. Let's talk about the graph Thinking about what you've learned in math and what you've been doing with graphs in math using this data table right here. What is this right here?\u000a  Time.\u000a  I want you guys to think about what we talked about with graphs. I want you to decide what kind of graph you should make.\u000a  Line graph because it's over time.\u000a  Yeah. Line graph. I decided. Yeah we decided to put a line graph because it's time.\u000a  So any time you use time, the line graph is the one to use. Very, very good.\u000a  Do we write the numbers on here?\u000a  Yeah. How are you gonna know what numbers to put on there? Think about it. You've got the trials, the distance, the time, and the speed. Do you need to use these? You're probably just gonna use your trial and your speed. So you'll label your line graph. One will be the trial and one will be the speed. And do you remember when you did the race car activity? Not the race car activity. I'm sorry. Remember the Stanley the Sluggish Snail? What did that line graph look like?\u000a  It was a straight line.\u000a  Because it was a constant speed. So what do you think this is gonna look like?\u000a  Constant speed. A straight line.\u000a  Good.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  You've got your trial. You got your times. Let's talk about your speed. First we need to look at your distance. How did you figure distance?\u000a  We need to divide by those speeds.\u000a  But your distance is how far the marble traveled; right?\u000a  18.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  18?\u000a  Yeah because you said each was six feet.\u000a  Six feet. You're doing it in inches.\u000a  Oh.\u000a  So let's go back and refigure that. I want you guys to talk about how to do that. 'Cause we want it in inches. So what is the first thing you would do? Y'all talk through it. Y'all talk to each other. Let's talk about it. After you're done erasing.\u000a  I was thinking like how many inches each--\u000a  Okay. There you go. Talk about it. Anybody know how many inches are in a foot?\u000a  16?\u000a  Nope. Try again. If you have a ruler.\u000a  12.\u000a  Yep. Good.\u000a  So that's 12 x 3.\u000a  Good.\u000a  36.\u000a  Okay. So 36 inches and then how many of these are there?\u000a  Three.\u000a  Uh-huh.\u000a  36 multiplied --\u000a  six speed. So you need to do 6 x 12.\u000a  6 x 12 is --\u000a  72.\u000a  Make sure you got it right.\u000a  I did it before. It is 72.\u000a  So now you will do 72 times...\u000a  Three.\u000a  Good. Do it on your paper\u000a  It's 216 inches.\u000a  Okay. Now what are you gonna do?\u000a  Write it down.\u000a  And then what?\u000a  Multiply 216 to this.\u000a  So how will you figure speed now?\u000a  Divide.\u000a  Divide what?\u000a  Three to 216.\u000a  Very good.\u000a  Can you tell me that again, Jeffrey? You're gonna do what?\u000a  Divide 216 into three.\u000a  And you'll only have to do it how many times?\u000a  One.\u000a  Because you got the same speed each time. You can do three into 216.\u000a  72.\u000a  And no remainder. That's nice. Isn't it? Now, knowing what we know about graphs, what we're doing in math. Jeffrey, are you listening? Y'all stop writing for a minute and listen. Knowing what we know about graphs, what we talked about in math, and using this data and speed, what kind of graph do you think you're gonna make?\u000a  Line.\u000a  Why did you say a line graph?\u000a  Because it's the same.\u000a  I want you to think about this right here. Over time. We discussed we need to use a line graph, okay? When you make your line graph, which two columns -- there's only two columns that you can use on there. Which two do you think you're gonna use?\u000a  This one and --\u000a  Well you've already figured that out. This one and which other one? And speed, good. Right. Because you were figuring all this for speed. What do you think your line's gonna look like?\u000a  Straight.\u000a  Straight. Because it was the same every time. Good.\u000a

V Okay, what's in here?  do me a favor. Go up, and tell me what I'm gonna need. Put . \u000a I put down the...\u000a If he's right, say .\u000a \u000a Okay boys and girls, because it is raining, I need my one, two, three--\u000a  Umbrella.\u000a What happened to that thing? I like red. Matches my jacket. Maybe, because it's raining.  This... This protects me from the rain. So, because it is raining, I need a one, two, three--\u000a  Umbrella.\u000a Umbrella.\u000a  Umbrella.\u000a I might put that here. Maybe I'll need it. Okay, maybe I'll need it later. Okay boys and girls, so let's keep going. Boys and girls, since it is , I'll need my . You wanna try it? Come up. Come up. I don't know, I don't know. \u000a Oh so now, ooh... \u000a Okay, so nice job. Because it is one, two, three--\u000a  Snowing.\u000a I'll need my--\u000a  Gloves.\u000a What type of gloves? I have these gloves. \u000a Are these gloves the type of gloves I need?\u000a  No.\u000a Are these gloves the type of gloves I need?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  No.\u000a I think, I don't think these will work. These gloves. Say it with me: gloves.\u000a  Gloves.\u000a Now just people in pink. Gloves.\u000a  Gloves.\u000a  Oh, there's a lot of people wearing pink. Okay, just boys.\u000a  Gloves.\u000a Just girls.\u000a  Gloves.\u000a Very nice. Just people from China.\u000a  Gloves.\u000a Just people from South America.\u000a  Gloves.\u000a All right. There we go. There we go. All right, let's keep moving, okay? Boys and girls, it is , so I'll need my . We're right here. What is this? What's going on here?\u000a  Windy.\u000a So windy. So windy. What do I need? Tina, come on up. Come on up. I don't know, maybe I'll use this.   \u000a Okay, so Tina, Tina. One, two, three guys. Because it is--\u000a  Windy.\u000a Okay, in Chinese it's--\u000a  \u000a Okay, I'll need my--\u000a  Jacket. \u000a All right, all right. Great, great, great, great. So guys, I just wanna say one thing. I wanna say that these words I'm using are cause and effect words. And we have some examples of clothing here that you're gonna need, and I want you to focus for a second with this. Say it with me: since.\u000a  Since.\u000a Because.\u000a  Because.\u000a So.\u000a  So.\u000a Boys and girls, these are words you use when speaking, when you're talking about cause and effect when speaking. Because it's snowing, I need my heavy jacket. That's cause and effect. These are words we use with speaking. These words, let's say them just one time for a little pronunciation practice. Thus.\u000a  Thus.\u000a Therefore.\u000a  Therefore.\u000a Consequence. Three syllables: Con-se-quence.\u000a  Consequence.\u000a All right, good, good. And the fact is.\u000a  And the fact is.\u000a These are pretty much words we're gonna use in writing only. We don't really speak these words, not often, very rare. These we used in speaking: since, because, and so. And these are the words you're gonna be using today. You're gonna be using them to write some simple sentences that show cause and effect relationships. These are more when you're writing an essay, an essay, like maybe for the ELA, or when you're writing an academic essay. Okay, so we have one more. You guys are doing so great. And I have a lot of stuff here. I have a one, two, three--\u000a  Scarf.\u000a Say it with me: scarf.\u000a  Scarf.\u000a What about that "F" on the end? Scarf.\u000a  Scarf.\u000a Scarf.\u000a  Scarf.\u000a Okay, I like this scarf. It's a nice scarf. I have a, what is this?\u000a  Sweater.\u000a Sweater or sweatshirt?\u000a  Sweatshirt.\u000a No, sweater. Sweater.\u000a  Sweater.\u000a Okay, I think when it's, what is this outside?\u000a  Sunny.\u000a Say it with me: sunny.\u000a  Sunny.\u000a It is sunny, so... I think, you know what's interesting is, this is the important word: so.\u000a  So.\u000a So I'll need...\u000a  Sunglasses.\u000a Boys and girls, when it gets really, really sunny outside, sometimes the sun hurts my eyes, so I put on my sunglasses. Okay, so... I want you to try it now. I want you to try it.  Boys and girls, now you all have in front of you two worksheets. You have one worksheet in front of you, you have two different ones. Many of you have this worksheet, and many of you have this worksheet, okay? I just gonna do one quick sentence here. Because it is hot, I'll need my--\u000a  Sunglasses. Shirt.\u000a Someone raise their hand. Tina. Tina, say that loud.\u000a  Sunglasses.\u000a Sunglasses.\u000a  Sunglasses.\u000a And, shorts. Oh, I didn't tell you about my shorts. I brought those today too. Say it with me: shorts.\u000a  Shorts.\u000a Say it with me: shorts.\u000a  Shorts.\u000a Okay, so it's sunny and I'm gonna need my shorts and sunglasses. I got 'em. I'll need my sunglasses and shorts. And "because" here, this is what you call a transition word. This is what we're working on. Now, if I have this here, Juan Pablo you have this worksheet. We have cause and effect. If I have this here, we have, let's say, since it is raining, I'll need my raincoat. And that's a coat for rain. It's on your list there. So, what is this word here? Say it with me: since.\u000a  Since.\u000a "Since" is a transition word. In speaking, and then sometimes writing like this style of writing, you would use these words. All the time in speaking, you show cause and effect. Since I don't have any money, I can't buy anything to eat tonight. Because it's raining, I think I'll go to the movies. Cause and effect, boys and girls. Use it each and every time you think about, speak about cause and effect. Now I want you to try this with your partner, and then we're gonna practice speaking these out. On three, I want you to go. Three, two, one, go.  Use the examples, use the sentences. And here's some more additional examples for you.  Do you see it up top? Clothing. Right here. Clothing. How would you make "clothes" out of that? Can you see it? Give it a try. Can you read this to me?  What do you need when it's hot?  Okay, so you see the list right here? Which items are for hot? Which items are for cold? Can you try to write that for me? I'm gonna come back. \u000a Look at the charts, they are there to help you.  You see the chart that I made? So, let's try something. I want to try something. Can you read me, actually read Hon Lu your first sentence. And you read her your first sentence. You first. Partner A, partner B. Partner A, go. You first, you're partner A.\u000a Because it is raining, I need my umbrella and raincoat.\u000a Because it's hot, I need my shorts.\u000a Okay, now you're speaking to each other, not to me. Okay, keep going. Go.\u000a Since it is sunny, I need my sunglasses. \u000a Can you write that there? Look right here. That list, for you. Okay, you see on the...   \u000a Look at the word. Slide through it. Two syllables.  Is that one boot? One boot? Or two? So how, is there... Yes, yes. Boots. Great. This is great stuff. I'm proud of you. So proud of you. Read this. You look like you haven't got started here. So listen to him, he did a really nice job here. And let's work together, okay? Can you read me your first sentence?\u000a  Because it's hot, so I need my sunglasses.\u000a Good, now pause. Now listen, I want you to try one. \u000a So I need my .\u000a I'm sorry, did you say the--\u000a  Umbrella.\u000a If it's hot, I need an umbrella?\u000a No.\u000a If it's, which one? Which one? If I, if it... Which one do I need an umbrella?\u000a

V A lot of people thought the mass of the water in the bag would be less than the mass of the ice cubes in the bag. How many people? One, two, just three of you. Okay. Cameron, do you want to start us off with your reason why?\u000a Because the, 'cause you can put water in a water bottle to put in the freezer, then that water bottle will like, explode, because it has so much ice in it.\u000a Okay. So because the water, when it freezes, expands, then therefore, you're saying it has more mass?\u000a Yeah.\u000a When it's frozen.\u000a Yes.\u000a But when it melts, it doesn't take up so much space, so it has less mass.\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay. Michael. Do you or are you on the same idea as far as more, as far as thinking there's less? Was your reason the same as his or do you have a different reason why it's going to be less?\u000a Mine was the same.\u000a  Same idea?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay. Hannah, you got a thought or something?\u000a Well, isn't it like, the same? Isn't it, like, the same thing because it's the same thing. It's just expanding, but it's going to have the same mass.\u000a  When you're saying it's the same thing, what do you mean by the same thing?\u000a Like, if you have water in a water bottle, like it does expand or whatever, but it still has the same amount of water so it still has the same mass.\u000a  Okay, so Hannah's saying it doesn't matter that it expands. It's still the same amount of stuff, and therefore it should still have the same amount of mass. Is that correct? 'Kay. Houston, idea on that?\u000a Well, about the water bottle thing, it would be opposite to this 'cause when you start with water, it takes up the entire bottle. But the bag, the ice is the one taking up the minimum space of when it freezes an entire bag. So it wouldn't.\u000a So are you saying if we let the ice cubes melt, are you saying the mass is going to go up? It's going to increase?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. Colby?\u000a I'd say that when a solid turns into a liquid, its form changes, but not its mass.\u000a  Okay, so kind of the same idea as Hannah. Only you're talking about the actual forms then. It can change form without changing mass. Hannah says it's okay to expand because it's still the same amount of stuff.  Okay. Michael's got another thing thing to talk about.\u000a Well when you put, like, the water in the bottle, and then you, like, freeze it, then you unfreeze it, then there's less water than what you started with, and it probably would change the mass.\u000a  Why is it, so you're saying the amount of water you put in first before you freeze it is more than the amount of water after you thaw it back out?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Do you have a reason why that might be?\u000a Well, no. it's just .\u000a  Okay, any other ideas on this one? Okay, how many people thought the mass would increase, then? How many people said the mass would increase? A couple of you. Jared, why don't you tell us why you think the mass would increase.\u000a I thought the mass would increase because water weighs more than ice. Like if you pick up a bottle of water that's frozen, it doesn't weigh as much as a bottle of water with water in it.\u000a Okay. So Jared says that water weighs more than ice. Correct? Anybody else have a different idea? Anna?\u000a  Well, because ice floats on water so that means it has less mass, so if it thawed back out, then it'd weigh more.\u000a Okay. So Anna's using the example that she's seen ice floating on water, therefore she's saying the ice must have less mass than water. Correct? Is that what your'e saying?\u000a  Mm-hmm.\u000a Colby, you got something to say about that?\u000a I have something to say about that. It will stay the same going off of what she's saying.\u000a Oh, going off of what she's saying. Okay, go ahead, then.\u000a Ice is pretty much the same as, it's water, it's frozen water, so it still has the same density as water, it's just colder. So, if it's colder, it floats. Ice because it's cold, it floats in the water.\u000a  So you're saying the floating of ice has nothing to do with its density or its mass, it has to do with its temperature. 'Kay. Houston?\u000a Well, I think the only reason ice floats is because an ice would weigh less because ice isn't completely full. There's some air in there.\u000a Okay. So Houston's saying there's some air trapped in there that was not in the water beforehand. Okay. Anybody else? Anybody want to have any other arguments about why the mass should stay the-- Oh, sorry. Anna.\u000a  Oh, okay. I disagree with Colby how he said that it floats because it's cold when heat rises, and so if it's cold, wouldn't it sink if it had to do with the temperature?\u000a Okay, so Anna's saying that heat rises and cold sinks, so you don't think it has to do with temperature?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay. Colby, response to that or are you...?\u000a Well, in water, it works differently. Warm water actually sinks more to the bottom actually, and cold water's more on the top.\u000a  Alright.\u000a So if you put cold in ice, it will float above.\u000a  Okay. Oh, I have some hands up now. Michael?\u000a Well, when you're in the lake for example, the warm part's on top, and the deeper you go the colder it gets because heat rises.\u000a  So you're using your experience in swimming or something in a lake.\u000a Yeah.\u000a  It's colder the deeper you go, warmer towards the surface, you're saying?\u000a Yeah, so the ice cube must have oxygen in it because when we hold our breath, we float up.\u000a  Okay.\u000a When we have no air, we go down.\u000a  Okay, so you're saying an ice cube has air trapped in it, that's what's causing it to float. Is that what you're saying? And Hannah, were you gonna agree with her as far as the lake water temperature thing?\u000a Yeah, so when you put your sweater or something in the water, it's like the top is usually more warm  colder.\u000a  Okay. Alright. Now people who think the mass is going to stay the same. Who are those people? Who thinks the mass will stay the same? Gavin, why don't you give us the reason why you think it's going to stay the same?\u000a I think it's going to stay the same because nothing's lost when it melts. Nothing goes away. It's still the same thing.\u000a  He's saying it's going to stay the same because nothing is lost. When it melts, it doesn't get lost. Okay. Anybody else who says it's going to stay the same have something to add? Gabe?\u000a I said that...\u000a  Just talk louder.\u000a I said that it'll stay the same because there's still the same amount of water melted or frozen, and even if it's in a bag, if it melts, and tries to... break down into gas, then it's still in the bag so it won't go anywhere.\u000a  So Gabe's saying that it doesn't matter if it's frozen as an ice cube, if it's melted as water, or even, he's even going as far as saying that even if the water, liquid starts turning into a gas, it's still going to be the same because nothing's leaving the bag. Is that what you're saying? He's going even a step further, he didn't even mention anything about turning into a gas, but he's saying even if it does that, it's still not going to change. Right? Houston.\u000a Well, I disagree with that because if you take a frozen lake the ice is only on top, it doesn't freeze all the water.\u000a Okay. Hannah.\u000a I agree with what he said. Even if there's air bubbles in the ice, then after it melts, the air bubbles, it's still in the bag. It's still concealed in the bag. \u000a  So sounds like the people who are for it, staying it's the same are really sticking with the fact that everything's in the bag. Nothing's out of the bag or leaving or coming in, and then the people who are thinking it's going to increase or decrease have a lot of ideas about ice having more mass than water as a solid, and then some of that's through the temperature. Michael, one more before we move on.\u000a About how it all stays in the bag, well, when you melt water it sweats. So wouldn't it lose some of that. \u000a  So are you saying some of the moisture's going to be on the outside of the bag?\u000a Like, comes off the bag. If you have it on the table, then it comes onto the table.\u000a Like how it has a \u000a  Okay, so here's my question to you then. That water that's on the outside of the bag that you're talking about? You were saying that water came from the inside of the bag?\u000a Well, it sweats from the... the compression of the temperature.\u000a  So you're saying that's what's causing the mass to go up, then.\u000a Wouldn't that cause the mass to go down?\u000a  Okay, so that's my question to you, then, is where was that water on the outside coming from?\u000a Inside?\u000a  How is it getting to the outside?\u000a I don't know. Some scientific theory. \u000a   Okay. Does anybody agree with her idea that some of the water from the inside might be getting to the outside?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Do any of you guys have an idea of how that might be happening to help her out? James, how do you think that water might be getting to the outside?\u000a  The moist is like, when it... What's it called? Wait a minute. The carbonate, the condensation, it, like, seeps out, like the air, it seeps out.\u000a So somehow you're thinking it's seeping through the bag. Colby?\u000a I know how that happens, actually. Because the water in the air will stick to the bag because it's colder. So it'll stick there and just condense there so it'll look like it's . It's just water from the air.\u000a So you're saying the water that forms on the outside is not coming from the inside? It's coming from the outside, which is different than what they're saying. Cameron, did you have any other ideas  how it might be getting out there? 'Kay. Alright. So we got some different ideas on that one. Let's move on now to our alka-seltzer problem.  This time, last one we started with people who thought the mass would decrease. Let's start with the people who think the mass will increase. So people who think the mass is going to increase with the alka-seltzer. Who are those people? Alright. We're going to have Kyle start us off on this one. What's your reason why, Kyle?\u000a Well, when the tablet dissolves I think after dissolving,  water will rise and make more.\u000a  Make more water?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. So Kyle thinks the reaction is going to create more water, and therefore, more mass.\u000a Sam, different idea than that for why the mass is going to increase? \u000a Okay, so you're thinking it's going to increase because you're adding something to the water. Colby?\u000a I think it's going to increase because the alka-seltzer tablet will release gases which will increase the weight of the bottle inside.\u000a  Okay so the gases that is going to be created from the reaction are going to add to the mass. Jake, you had your hand up for the mass increasing, correct? Do you have a different reason why it's going to do that? \u000a So basically saying, the same thing as Colby. More gases. Hannah.\u000a Aren't the gases from the water in the alka-seltzer, aren't they going to just stay the same?\u000a  Good question. So what you're saying, then, is if the gases are coming from the alka selzter tablet in water, so what are you saying the mass will do?\u000a I think it's going to stay the same. Actually, it'll decrease.\u000a  It'll decrease? Okay, why do you think it's going to decrease?\u000a I don't know.\u000a Okay.  Who could come up with the reason as to why it might decrease? Cameron? Why is it going to decrease?\u000a Because the acid from the, from the, from the tablet, the acid from the tablet is going to release gases, and the water will go out of the beaker.\u000a How is the water going to get out of the beaker?\u000a Because the tablet will react with water, and the gases will float away.\u000a But isn't there a lid on top?\u000a Maybe the lid will pop off or something.\u000a Let's assume the lid is does not pop off. Let's assume I have it on there tight enough that it's not going to pop off.\u000a Then, since air is lighter than water, then that means that the air, that means the mass will decrease because the water will be like not as much, and there will be more gas in the container.\u000a So. Correct me if I'm wrong. So you're saying that assuming the top stays on, it's still going to decrease. That's the decrease, right? Because the solid and liquid are going to turn into...\u000a Gas.\u000a Gas, and gas is lighter than solids and liquids. Is that correct? What you're saying?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Alright. Jared has something to say about that.\u000a I think that the mass will decrease because the tablet will disintegrate and that mass part will be  decrease.\u000a Okay, so he's saying that the tablet disappears, then the mass will go down. That piece that the tablet's bringing to the table for mass is not going to be there anymore. Kevin, what are you thinking?\u000a Pretty much the same thing that the tablet's going to dissolve into the water.\u000a  And so mass will go down?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay.\u000a  Who thinks the mass is going to stay the same? It's not going to change. Who thinks it will stay the same? Why don't you tell us why it's going to stay the same?\u000a I think it's going to stay the same because the water, the alka-seltzer piece is a water, it's just in a different form. But everything is still .\u000a Okay. So you're saying because nothing's going away, it's still going to be the same. It's just in a different form. So kind of like what some people were saying about ice in the water. Gabe, do you have a different reason than that?\u000a No, it was a lot like hers.\u000a  It was the same as hers, pretty much?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay. Anybody got anything else they want to input on the alka-seltzer one? Why it might go up, down or stay the same before we move on?\u000a Gavin?\u000a I said it would probably go down because if you have a bunch of gas in a bottle, it'll probably weigh a lot less than a cup full of water, like the same amount.\u000a  Okay, so you're going again with the idea that gas has less mass than the water and the tablet. And since we're turning them into gases, the mass will go down. James.\u000a I said since the tablet is gonna be kind of shrinked, once it mixes with the water, it'll stand, making it a lot more liquidy and bigger and then the mass will get higher.\u000a The mass will increase because it'll produce the...  Alright. Let's go to burning paper. Alright.  Burning paper. Let's start with the people, this time, let's start with the people who think the mass will stay the same. People who think the mass still stay the same.\u000a Colby's the only one. Morgan. Gabe. Not very many. Jasmine. Morgan, why don't you start us off for why you think it's going to stay the same.\u000a I said the mass will stay the same because the air and everything else is still in the jar and it's not going anywhere.\u000a Okay she says it stays the same because everything is still in the jar not going anywhere. Jasmine, you had your hand up. Do you think the same thing as her or do you have a different reason for why it would stay the same?\u000a I agree with her.\u000a  You agree with what she said?\u000a Colby?\u000a Burning stuff does not add. It's still the object, but it's more spread apart.\u000a  Okay, so the mass stays the same, you said. It's just we're going to take up more space with it. Okay. Michael? No? Yes?\u000a I was stretching.\u000a  Hannah?\u000a I disagree with that because it, when it burns,  I don't know if that's the word for it, but how it's  causing it all, when you burn wood in a fire, eventually all that will turn into ashes, so I don't think it has the same mass or anything.\u000a  Okay. James, you got some more on that?\u000a When that paper burns, it'll turn into charcoal which basically is lighter than paper, and then that'll make it so mass will be decreased.\u000a Okay, so given the idea that we're taking the solid things, and we're changing them into maybe non-solids, so either liquids or liquid acids they're not gonna have as much mass as those. Edward, what do you think? Do you think this mass will go up, down or stay the same?\u000a I think it will decrease.\u000a  Decrease?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  And what's your reason for that?\u000a 'Cause when the paper burns, it turns into a gas, so some of it, and then gas is, has less mass than solid objects.\u000a  Okay, so again, back to that gas is less mass than solid objects. Kayla, what do you think? Increase? Decrease? Or stay the same?\u000a I thought it would decrease, like what Hannah--\u000a, It'll disintegrate \u000a  Okay. So, as a quick vote, how many people thought, on this one, oh, sorry, Kevin, go ahead.\u000a Also, I think it's gonna decrease, because, the paper's gonna burn and incinerate, but also, the match, when you light the match, it's gonna burn, too.\u000a Okay. Some of you, maybe, forgot about the match. I haven't heard you mention it, until just now, so that, not only is the paper gonna burn up, but so will, at least part of, the match. Okay, 'cause it's burning too, alright? A quick vote. How many people, on this one, said the mass would go down, would decrease? And how many said it would increase? And, how many said it'd stay the same? So, the majority of you are on the decrease side, on this. Okay, here's my next question. We've now heard what a bunch of people had to say, about each different situation. One, if it would increase, or decrease, or stay the same. My question to you now is that, after listening to all the people throw ideas out there, has anybody changed their mind on any of these? In other words, like, maybe for the ice in the water one, I was thinking it was going to increase, but, after listening to every one, now, I think it's gonna decrease.\u000a

V It's probably three. Because five to the third is 125.\u000a  Alright, so let's test that out.\u000a Can I use my calculator?\u000a  You can have your guy test it out here.\u000a Oh.\u000a The other thing to work on is the pronunciation of this. This is something that is unusual because it's got that subscript. Read that first line up at the top where it says "pronouncing logarithmic equations".\u000a Log base b of x equals y.\u000a Yeah, so can you transfer that pronunciation to, for example, the one in example six? How would you say that out loud?\u000a Log base two of eight equals...\u000a  It's three.\u000a  Equals three. So, that's how we say these things out loud. Log base two of eight. The little number, this subscript, is the base. Keep going, you guys are doing fantastic.\u000a  Speak up.\u000a The log of 10,000 is four. Forgot, I don't have a pencil.\u000a  You're off. No pencil.\u000a In number nine, is it one?\u000a For number nine?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a When the log, when the base is equal to X.\u000a  When B is equal to X it will be one.\u000a  So would 10 be negative one?\u000a Uh, 10, yeah negative one.\u000a  Oh, I think I get it now.\u000a And then 11 would be...\u000a  Negative three.\u000a Negative three yeah. It's like the power stable thing, you know?\u000a : Yeah.\u000a It's like four to the y would be equal to this?\u000a : Yeah.\u000a : So, 12 and 13 would be zero?\u000a Let's see.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yep.\u000a  : Okay.\u000a Pretty easy.\u000a Yeah and...\u000a  : What's 14?\u000a 14 is one-half.\u000a  : So again what you're saying is...\u000a If it's a fraction or if like, like for 14,\u000a  : Yeah. It'd be a fraction. So 14 came out a fraction or a decimal of half.\u000a : Yeah.\u000a So that, what about that one made you think it's going to come out a fraction versus the other ones that were all integers?\u000a The other ones were integers because in the log, the little exponent there\u000a Mmhm.\u000a is less than the actual number.\u000a Okay, let's work on the pronunciation because this is something that's brand new as far as how to say this thing out loud. Let's go back up to the top, where it says "read this out loud". So, Matt, I'll have you... Are you the, what is your role here?\u000a We're professors here.\u000a Oh, so that's a good role for you. So, why don't you speak that out loud.\u000a Log base root of x equals y.\u000a Yeah, now I want you to say the first example out loud.\u000a Log base of, log base five of 25 equals 2.\u000a Yeah, so it's hard to pronounce it.\u000a Yeah.\u000a But the little number, that's down is what?\u000a Uh, base.\u000a Yeah, so it's the base. So when we say it, we're gonna say base little number, whatever it is. Alright, so now say what you were saying before, either of you guys. You told me why it comes out a fraction. How will you recognize it comes out a negative number?\u000a When the y, or when the x is a fraction, and the log base is a whole number.\u000a Okay, yeah, so like, which examples do that?\u000a Ten and eleven.\u000a Alright, that's good. How, will you recognize if it comes out as zero? See any patterns for the ones that log?\u000a If the x is a 1.\u000a  : Alright, yeah. Why does that make sense? Have you figured it out?\u000a : Like, any number to the power of 1 is itself, or no, it's zero. Or I mean, not any number to the power of zero is one.\u000a  : Exactly. Alright, you're very, you're getting right to the idea of what a log is. How will you recognize the ones that will come out one, without calculating?\u000a X equals the base.\u000a  : Okay, well said. Why does that make sense in terms of exponents?\u000a 'Cause if you divide itself, it'll equal one.\u000a  : Can you give me an example of an exponential equation that might look like this one? Because that's the next thing we're going to try to do...\u000a Seven to the fifth power.\u000a Seven to the one equals seven. Good, having done all of this, can you say what a log is in one word?\u000a A single word.\u000a It's like the power of...\u000a  : Mmhm, it's the exponent.\u000a Yeah.\u000a  : Good, a log is an exponent. Now, what I'd like you to do is try to do the bottom ones based on what your understanding of log is, yeah.\u000a : Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh...\u000a It would be.\u000a Don't stop.\u000a So it's gotta be two. Take the, so the first one would be 32 because basically the base is the actual number and the answer to the logarithm is the actual number.\u000a : So right to the there...\u000a Yeah, so 32.\u000a Something with...\u000a  : Something to the fourth...\u000a Yeah.\u000a Maybe five, five to the fourth.\u000a : Five, to the...\u000a Execuse you.\u000a So 59 is...\u000a : One, 52 equals one.\u000a So it'd be 59.\u000a Yeah.\u000a 18 would be...\u000a  : Just three.\u000a : Is it a thousand?\u000a Yeah, a thousand. You put ten thousand.\u000a : I have a question.\u000a Yeah.\u000a For this one, what's the, for this one, what's the log? No, well, yeah, I don't know.\u000a  : The log of what?\u000a  : I think I understand your question, but you first have to figure out the way to read these things. Read that part, that first, because the pronunciation is challenging at first.\u000a Log base b of x equals y.\u000a  : Alright, so now read example... Well, we know example four is three. So, the log is three. So read example four out loud.\u000a So log three of 27 equals three?\u000a  : Good, except I want you to say the word base in there.\u000a Okay log base three of 27 equals three.\u000a  : Perfect, so I think your question was about examples seven and eight?\u000a So, what's the base?\u000a : Wouldn't the base be one, it's just not there?\u000a  : It's not there. Here's the question, the answers, the logs came out two for number seven and four for number eight. Go back to what you guys were saying about an exponential equation. What's equivalent to that?\u000a  : Oh, if it's not there, the base is ten.\u000a  : Alright, so can you write the equivalent exponential equation for example seven?\u000a Ten squared equals 100.\u000a  : Ten squared equals 100. Does it still work for that? Is that void?\u000a Mmhm. Because it would be ten to the fourth equals...\u000a : But I thought he just said the base was one.\u000a Well, he said the base was one. He thought it might be.\u000a Oh, it's not.\u000a  : It turns out it's ten.\u000a Okay.\u000a  : So the base, if not written, is ten. I want you to check this two ways. Who's our calculator person here? Alright, so Brandon I want you just to type in the log, but just use this button. It's next to the seven. Just type in log of 100. So if he doesn't use any base, it comes out as two. Now, try it with the log base, on the new operating system log base ten of 100.\u000a Log base ten of 100?\u000a  : Mmhm. See if that still works.\u000a Two.\u000a  : It turns out, it's sort of optional. If there's no base what is the base?\u000a Nothing.\u000a No, it's a certain thing. So, if there's no base written, like all of the other ones had a base written...\u000a : Okay.\u000a  : If there's no base written it's saying what's the number to raise a certain base to, to get 100? And this one came out two. So, what's the number, that you can use as a base, squared to get 100?\u000a Ten.\u000a  : Yeah, so if there's no base, the base applied is ten. And it turns out, you can write it or not. So, what I'd like you guys to do is as you're working through these, also consider what would be an equivalent exponential equation for each of the ones that you're taught.\u000a So just do all of the ones at the bottom and then go back and do it again.\u000a  Yeah, sure. And the one's at the bottom, you can't just type into the calculator. So you got to kind of think a little bit about what would be the relationship there.\u000a : Then for like, any number in there?\u000a That's a really good insight. How come that's the case?\u000a Because anything to the zero power is one.\u000a  : You got it. Yeah. Except for one number. There's one number you can't put there.\u000a Zero.\u000a  : Yeah, good job. You got it, good job.\u000a Thank you.\u000a 20 would be 81...\u000a I wasn't even close.\u000a So, ten, alright so ten to the third would be 1000?\u000a  : For 18, wouldn't it be a thousand, supposed to be base, is implied to be ten. Ten to the third would be 1000.\u000a I'm not sure.\u000a  : For 18.\u000a  : I don't know. \u000a  : Alright.\u000a  : Alright, say it again, except this time include the word base.\u000a Log base of, log base of eight. Wait, log base of eight equals zero?\u000a  : Close. Log base eight...\u000a Log base eight of one equals zero.\u000a  That's it exactly, yeah.\u000a Okay.\u000a  : So we say base, where's the base always on a log equation?\u000a : Under the exponent.\u000a  : Yeah its a subscript, it's down.\u000a A subscript...\u000a  : So I'd like you to pronounce number 12.\u000a Log three of one equals zero.\u000a  : Close. I want you to get the word base in there.\u000a Log base three of one equals zero.\u000a  : Yeah, and that way, if you're always saying what the base is, when you create an equivalent exponential function, it's going to be a lot easier. So next to each one of these, let's do a few together. Let's do the top row, going one, six, 11. I want you to write an exponential equation using 5, 25, and 2.\u000a : So it would just be, five squared equals 25.\u000a  : Exactly. What's the base in that equation?\u000a : It's five.\u000a Yeah. So, you did two cubed equals eight. Yeah. Yeah, so now you recognize, you guys correctly identified that a log can be summarized as an exponent. Yeah, that's good. Each of these numbers is an exponent. What'd you notice about the ones that came up zero? Would you be able to recognize those and predict...\u000a  : Any number works for it. Really.\u000a What do you mean any number works for it?\u000a For this one...\u000a Oh, I see for that last one.\u000a You could put any number here other than zero.\u000a  : Yes.\u000a : I thought it was one, but they had got it.\u000a  : One works, but so does two.\u000a  : So does, two, three, four and five.\u000a  : I'm wondering about the ones like 12 and 13. How would you predict or recognize in the future, that the log is going to be zero?\u000a If it has a one for the...\u000a  : X\u000a For the X, yeah.\u000a  : Mmhm, yep. I think there's a fancy mathy word, called a characteristic for that. But we don't use that word very often. But yeah, you could say the x 'cause that's how it showed up in our first equation. Sure. How will you recognize that it's going to come out a negative number?\u000a : If it has a fraction in it.\u000a  : Mmhm.\u000a As the X.\u000a  : Okay, well said, yeah. Why does that make sense in terms of what you know about exponents?\u000a On the green chart, whatever is on the left side and whatever's left...\u000a  : Yeah. Our powers table. You're talking about all of our fractions here. Yeah. How about the ones that came out with one as the log. The log was one.\u000a : They have the same base and the same x value.\u000a And what about this one? This is a fraction, so...\u000a  : Yeah, how come it had a negative log?\u000a Well, I know it's because it's a fraction.\u000a  : Can you write an equivalent exponential equation?\u000a Two to the, no, two to the negative one\u000a  : Mmhm.\u000a equals, it doesn't equal this right?\u000a  : Actually it does. Two to the negative one, equals half.\u000a Okay.\u000a  : Yep.\u000a Okay, so that's correct.\u000a

V  From the top.\u000a  This way?\u000a  Starting from the top. Woo hoo!\u000a  That went better. \u000a  Can we have a ruler?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  75.\u000a  Okay, make sure you record it. 75 what?\u000a  75 cm\u000a  C-M. What's C-M stand for?\u000a  Centimeters!\u000a Centimeters.\u000a  Okay, now we've got to get the average.\u000a  I'm gonna do the average.\u000a  Go ahead, go to your next one. I'm gonna check on the next group.\u000a  Okay, no you don't put 75 for all of them.\u000a  I'm not.\u000a  Just on that one. We knew it wouldn't go any farther. Just put 75 for the first one.\u000a  Second part.\u000a  Trial two. Now, what do we do?\u000a  Okay, go ahead. Tell me what you found out? What did you discover about bubble wrap, sand paper, wax paper and just the plain ramp?\u000a  On the bubble wrap, it didn't go. Because it was a bumpy surface. Because all the bumps, because it was too bumpy and had to much friction.\u000a  Too much friction, okay. And so, what did you discover, Sean?\u000a  I discovered that on the sand paper it got higher and lower\u000a  What do you mean by that, higher and lower, and higher? Can you explain that a different way to me?\u000a  well-- \u000a  So what does that say about the surface?\u000a  \u000a  Increase and decrease. Spencer, what did you discover?\u000a  So--\u000a  So it went farther on plain wrap versus the wax paper?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay, so, right now  you're going to find the average, right? How are you gonna find the average?\u000a  Like 32 plus, plus 30, plus 41, divided by three.\u000a  Okay, you guys go ahead and do that. Who's going to be the calculator?\u000a  I am.\u000a  You are? Okay. I might suggest someone else also be the calculator, so you can compare your numbers, and then I'm gonna come back and talk to you about your results. Okay?\u000a  Okay, let's sit down. Let's see what your doing.\u000a  It's not going very good on the sand paper.\u000a  Because it's just like the carpet.\u000a  Why won't it go as far on sandpaper?\u000a  Because it's like the carpet.\u000a  Okay, what does that tell you about friction?\u000a  That if it's sand paper it doesn't have a lot of contact--\u000a  It rubs against the rug.\u000a  It rubs against the tires-- I think it doesn't--\u000a  One person at a time. Paul?\u000a  Because it rubs up against the tires and it doesn't have a lot of friction. If it did have a lot of friction it would go faster.\u000a  Okay, so does sand paper have friction, or not? Yes or no?\u000a  No. No.\u000a   Yes.\u000a  What is friction? One person at a time.\u000a  It's like...whoosh.\u000a  That's friction? Hm. Okay, can you explain, what is your idea, Stephen? Friction?\u000a  When a car rolls on carpet, it's friction because it slows it down. Sand paper slows it down, too.\u000a  So far, what have you discovered about friction, and wax paper versus sand paper?\u000a  Wax paper--\u000a  Let's let Stephen tell me, okay?\u000a  Wax paper is, kinda like, it's probably gonna be like the...\u000a  Look at your numbers and what have you discovered so far? Because you already recorded them.\u000a  It's the highest so far.\u000a  What does that mean, it's the highest so far?\u000a  It's the one that has the least amount of friction.\u000a  It has the least amount of friction, okay? And how do you know that?\u000a  Because we did the experiment.\u000a  And what happened?\u000a  It didn't go as far...\u000a  It didn't go as far on what?\u000a  \u000a  Okay, go ahead an finish your experiment. Go ahead and finish on the plain ramp, you have one more to do, I see here. Okay? And then we'll talk about what we should do next.\u000a  Oh, 39.\u000a  That's showing you more about fourth dimension. \u000a  Let's talk about our results. Talk about your results that you've noticed. Sh. Stephen, Tanner, I need to be able to hear this group, okay?\u000a  We found now, that our total averaged out to 85cm.\u000a  \u000a ...for our total average.\u000a  Okay, what does this tell you? Look at your averages. What does this tell you about friction?\u000a  That friction slows you down, like the salt slows you down on ice. Like the plain ramp is kinda like the ice. It makes you go faster.\u000a  Right, and you know what it's doing outside, right now? What is it doing outside right now?\u000a  It's sleeting.\u000a  It's sleeting, it's snowing, and the roads are very, very slick. So, what do you think's gonna be a great idea, because I know my husband's coming home from work tonight. The roads are gonna be slippery. What's gonna happen so they can create friction so the roads are safer? What should the road crews do?\u000a  Salt.\u000a  They can put salt and ...?\u000a  Salt and sand.\u000a  Salt and sand. Yes.\u000a \u000a  Why?\u000a  \u000a  So it didn't go at all? I wonder if it was small, little bubble wrap, if it would work better? What do you think?\u000a  I think if they were popped--\u000a  Oh, if they were popped, I wonder if they would. Maybe so. Okay, down here you have a graph that we're gonna talk about a little bit later. But this is what I want you to do: I want you to pretend like you're a teacher, and if you were going to tell someone one thing that you learned today from this experiment that we did. What would you tell them? I want you to write it on the back of here. What's one thing that you've learned today that you would teach someone and then we're gonna talk about it, okay? I want you to talk about it when you're done writing, talk about it with each other and I'll be back in a minute, okay?\u000a  We can share when we're done writing.\u000a  Or we can share them as we write them. So, what would we tell someone?\u000a \u000a  I would say friction on the ramp would make something go slower. What would you say?\u000a  I would say the rougher the surface, the more friction.\u000a  I would say something about the same thing that you guys were saying, except a little bit different. I would say... it depends on which kind of surface it is. If it's bumpy, it won't go. If there's bumps and air all over on it. If it's a smooth and soft surface, it will probably go a lot faster.\u000a  So, tell me what you-- are you still writing?\u000a  We all shared it.\u000a  Okay, but I want to see it in writing. Like I want to see something written down.\u000a  I said the bumpier the surface the more friction it makes.\u000a  Okay--  Spencer, what are you gonna write?\u000a  Because I'm gonna write kind of the same thing as Heather.\u000a  Is there anything your gonna change about it? Or add to it?\u000a  I'm gonna say the bumpier the ramp is the more friction and the less... and the less further it goes.\u000a  Okay, I like that. I think you guys are learning a lot about this. Sean, I see your writing something a little bit different. What are you writing?\u000a  I'm writing the smoother the surface, the farther the car goes.\u000a  You guys are right. The farther it goes. Because why?\u000a  Because the friction, because the surface is too bumpy and it has a lot of friction so it was causing it to not go. But on a smoother surface-- \u000a  Barely any what? What word is she looking for? She said on a smoother surface there's barely any friction. And I like what you said. You said "A smooth surface is like ice." A smooth surface is like ice, right?\u000a  I said the bumpier the surface, the more friction.\u000a  Right, but you also said, something, that if it was a smooth surface, it's kinda like ice. There's no friction to keep it from, like if it's outside today, if it's ice, your car could go anywhere, but putting sand down or the salt, keeps it ...\u000a  Less friction.\u000a  More, it has more friction. Okay. Okay, go ahead and finish. What? What do you want?\u000a  I wonder what would happen if you tried snow and see if it would run on snow and then we tried ice.\u000a  Oh, so how would be do that? I like that. How would we do it?\u000a  When it's like an icy day or something and there's a little bit of ice somewhere, we could bring the car out or something, not like a real car--\u000a  Oh, okay. \u000a  Just like a play car--\u000a  And try it out.\u000a  Try it out on ice and then they would put a little snow and then we would try and see if it would go faster on the snow or on the ice.\u000a  How could we change this experiment? What could we do next time if we wanted to change it to find something different out?\u000a  I think you could use a plain surface and you could probably use popped bubble wrap.\u000a  We talked about that.  Popped bubble wrap, and what else did you say? The bubble wrap could be what? Talk about that, the bubble wrap could be what? Guys, I need you to not come in here.\u000a  You can use  un-popped bubble wrap and you can use the tile, and you probably use, like a grid with the marbles. Instead you can, like, use a car.\u000a  Okay, talk about that.\u000a  To see if it would fall off.\u000a  Now, what would be the purpose to see if it would fall off? With force and motion, how does that tie in?\u000a  Well, what I mean is, will it like go far...\u000a  If you make a ramp and you try to get it on and wanted to see if it would fall off or not...\u000a  Like if it was on the--\u000a  It depends how fast it would go, if it went faster would it fall off?\u000a  But if we're talking about friction, does this have anything to do with friction?\u000a \u000a  Oh, I love that. So, wood, carpet, and ice. And we could freeze ice, because we have big containers...\u000a

V  Look, I can be a serk . \u266b Now, my whole house, is great \u266b I can do anything good \u266b I like my school, I like anything \u266b I like my dad, I like my cousins \u266b I like my aunts, I like my Allisons \u266b I like my mom, I like my sister \u266b I like my dad \u266b I like my hair, I like my hair cuts \u266b I like my pajamas, I like my stuff \u266b I like my room \u266b I like my whole house! \u266b My whole house is great \u266b I can do anything good \u266b Yeah, yeah, yeah \u266b I can do anything good \u266b Better then anyone \u266b \u000a  Okay. Ok, what'cha learn from the video?\u000a  She can do anything.\u000a  Ok, what else?\u000a  She likes to sing.\u000a  Be positive.\u000a  She likes to sing, be positive. What else? What else did you learn about the video?\u000a  Believe in yourself.\u000a  Believe in yourself. Okay now how is this going to be related to our yearbook class?\u000a  Stay positive about it. People get a... what's gonna-- what the outcome's gonna be.\u000a  Okay, and the outcome is something that we wanna be able to serve the entire school. Okay, what else? How is this also related to yearbook and what we're trying to accomplish?\u000a  We shouldn't blame ourselves?\u000a  I'm sorry?\u000a  We shouldn't blame ourselves?\u000a  Okay, good, good. Okay, so what we're going to do after this this is a good start, I think, for the work that we're gonna be having to do this afternoon. We're gonna have to work on our ladder. And I know that we've spent some time on it, we've had to make some considerable changes. But I think that the compromise.. the agreement that we all talked about yesterday, I think it can be implemented today. So what we're gonna try to do, is based on... These are the signatures, that we have allocated. One signature for elementary school. One signature for middle school. And five signatures for the high school. I think let's try to fit it in. Let's try to stay within the seven signatures. Don't forget, we have ads also. Okay, so I think Tanisha, and... Dustin, and... Jazz, will be on team one. And Sammy, Emily, and Colleen, will be on team two. Let's work together. What are the rules of getting the teamwork going? When we're trying to discuss, What are the things that I want you to think about?\u000a  Everyone has a voice.\u000a  Okay, everyone has a voice. What else?\u000a  We all have to agree to a middle ground.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  And it's not just for the high school seniors.\u000a  Okay, so it's for the entire school. The elementary school, middle school and high school. So let's be fair, and try to get everybody involved. What else? Discussion-wise, among yourselves. What would I like you to be working on? Collaborative work? Compromise? \u000a  Okay, let's go ahead and start. You have the books there, you have copies of the previous ladder. Let's get it good. \u000a Yeah?\u000a  I understand, elementary school, middle school, high school. In what order--\u000a  It's up to you honey. If you want to start with the middle school, elementary school, high school.\u000a  I don't know, maybe just 'cause I'm a senior, I kinda like that plan.\u000a  It just seems weird  starting at the elementary school. I think it's just that, they're not as important, just that--\u000a  'Cause it's always started at high school. It starts with the seniors and it's like this is what, for--\u000a  Okay now, remember, just because it's always done before--\u000a  I know but--\u000a  If we started with the elementary school, We'd be starting with the fourth grade. And that's really our--\u000a  Kind of an  awkward place to start.\u000a  Okay, now remember with your signature, you were gonna start with Student Life, correct? With the High School? So you could start with that. I mean look at it and you can see. \u000a  And then we're  gonna start it with, like the introduction... Um, like, um...\u000a  Pictures.\u000a  Student life, candid shots.\u000a  Right.\u000a  And then we're going to the seniors and all the senior stuff, and our classes. And then the sports and night clubs?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  We're not gonna have a class... class division page, anymore. 'Cause all of the classes are scrambled. Are we still thinking, like, doing division pages? Like how it was worded originally? Except, not for the classes. Because all the classes were split up.\u000a  Yeah, now it makes it easier to do your "me", right? Don't forget, what's our theme?\u000a  "Me".\u000a  Okay, so keep that it mind when you're creating your signatures. And I think, now that solicited more... allocated, the sections are allocated. Your division pages-- maybe more adaptable.\u000a  They'll fit in there more.\u000a  Yeah. They'll fit in there more. Don't ya think?\u000a  I guess. \u000a  So should we  just do one, like just high school division page, then middle school--\u000a  Yes, try it and see. See. Now you might still need a division page for sports, you might still need a division page. But you don't need as many. I think--\u000a  We definitely won't have one for the classes. 'Cause they're all split up.\u000a  They're already split up. And I think this is what helped save us pages. Remember, you're getting eight signatures.\u000a  Um, Question.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  The yearbook,  two pages and ads is under the high school?\u000a  Only because, I just put that as just to remind you that we need to have ads at the very end.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  So whatever, is your last section, you have to have ads. We have to start selling ads. And again, if you have any questions on the photographs, Sammy is here she can help you with what ever photograph you want. \u000a  \u000a  Show the blood drive scales. And then... \u000a  But their only  sport is the seventh grade basketball. Everything else is going into high school.\u000a  Does it make sense?\u000a  Yeah, yeah.\u000a  They all happened right there, together.\u000a  Are we still gonna do straight lines, and single lines like they did?\u000a  I think we might just do a big column.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  We can still do that, and then after our seniors, we can explore all the classes in line.\u000a  And it makes sense? If you have that quote.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  We are gonna do... "Student Life", seniors, all the senior stuff, And then classes?\u000a  Make sure that you have your page counts.\u000a  Are doing school division pages or are we doing section division pages?\u000a  I guess we could  do school, and then-- We would have to have the division pages that we thought of-- the spread division page with all the things. It could just be different little division pages.\u000a  Yeah, okay, so...\u000a  Or like, have  the title at the top of the page. \u000a  Don't forget, she has control of the photographs. So you need to consult with her, okay? You can ask her.\u000a  Okay, um.\u000a \u000a  So are we going  to do a senior opening page?\u000a  I think we could just  have... an opening page, on the division page.\u000a  I thought we were going  to do the top. \u000a  Instead of doing a collage, how they put in their, like, the song and all that on the second page. Around all the photos, we should put-- 'Cause, in our theme or whatever, it's just a strip. Of pictures. Blended in the big picture. So we're have written around it, to add in these. So I think that we should put these, on the first, opening page.\u000a  Now remember, we did this only because... we had no choice.\u000a  I like, well I like,  the happenings that we decided not to do, for the opening page for the seniors. Because, it's new life. Since our theme, it's just one strip. We could arrange it like this. I think that we should put, on that page, we should put these.\u000a  Oh, definitely. Yeah, good idea. Well, what happened, is the reason why I placed it and you placed it here because when you sort it all originally, it was so empty, and it didn't mean anything, so, we went ahead and did that.\u000a  I think it would have been better to do that from the beginning.\u000a  And then we can have  Alex start doing the onward for two others.\u000a  Do we... want to put favorites before the formal?\u000a  I think we should put favorites.\u000a  So, we're talking this one, right? These are the formals you want before the favorites.\u000a  No, we want our  favorites before our formals.\u000a  Oh, Okay.\u000a  And then we're combining formal and baby pictures in quotes right?\u000a  Yeah. Well, you know, what do you think?\u000a  Well I like, combining it.\u000a  Can you pull up the other ladder? Do you still have that one?  If we have that picture, and then another picture, and then another--\u000a  This one? Is this the ladder you want to see? Which section do you want to pull?\u000a  "Student life".  I think it's on that.\u000a  Right here?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Let me know. Because then I can go back and let her know.\u000a  So, you want to start off with that?\u000a  So it'll be like... The formal, then the baby, and then the quote.\u000a  Can you tell Emily what she missed yesterday? About the quotes. No, were you present? When you said that a lot of seniors who didn't have quotes last year.\u000a  They would rather have a big list of them and just have them pick and cross it off. If they can come up with their own.\u000a  And I have a quote book. Somewhere, and we can start deciding. We can go from very funny, to very serious. So the kids can have a good choice. \u000a  Did you want me to go back to the other one? \u000a  How are you deciding the order? Is it, just from serious to funny or...\u000a  Well it's more, funner stuff, the memories into the more serious stuff.\u000a  And you're ending it with the grauduation?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  You rather repeat our homecoming?\u000a  But that's spirit week.\u000a  There's another one--\u000a  That's what  homecoming fills. This is the problem. On the other ladder that we had, the only high school "Student Life" we had was "Holten Hemming" and "Spirit Week".\u000a  That's the same thing.\u000a  Yeah, Hemming  and Spirit Week. Like, one spread and then the awards honors. Well that doesn't make up for all the signatures.\u000a  Oh, then we had prom.\u000a  You had the prom, and then you had... how about the senior, the um... "Sports Banquet". Sports Banquet should award everybody. Not just seniors.\u000a  Yeah, it's got uh--\u000a  Do you want to put that under student--\u000a  I don't...\u000a  What if we-- You cut the prom down to one page, but maybe we could, put it back to two pages, we could show, like the planning of prom and setting it up.\u000a  Okay, but--\u000a  'Cause I'm  on the prom committee.\u000a  Okay, so, and you have your committee meeting, start taking pictures. Guys, remember, we have seven cameras. So take cameras with you when you're having little meetings. Just make sure you're flexible enough, just in case we don't have enough pictures, you can flip back to one page instead of the signature. I mean, instead of a spread.\u000a  Well,  I don't know how we're gonna fill up the signature then.\u000a  Well you don't have to have-- we can move everything up.\u000a  And then  we move seniors up into another half of the signature, and that half would have to be colored. Because it's the senior signature.\u000a  Um... Do you have a section for committee?\u000a  We had those  in with the clubs. With like, all of their-- what they do in the community.\u000a  Okay, if you want, you can bring it up a little more. Just the overall community that doesn't have a club. And use up that space. Like the blood drive. The blood drive is not part of the school.\u000a  Rotary does that.\u000a  Rotary, yes, but that's the... interact is with Rotary, yes?\u000a  Yeah, we help with that. We help Rotary.\u000a  But you also do the "Victorian Classic"?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  You don't have enough space. You need to put the blood drive up. I mean, how much space breaks--\u000a  A spread.\u000a  Oh, Interact has a spread?\u000a  Yeah, we've  covered this three times now.\u000a  Okay, sorry. Yes, but we've changed it three times. So... Find other community things. Well, if you want, do you want to talk about the tax bill?\u000a  Well, that's not  really student life.\u000a  It's going to affect your life.\u000a  Yeah, but...\u000a

Z - zebra.\u000a  Alright, I want you to find the letter that makes the sound that you hear at the beginning of the word "hedgehog." Hedgehog.\u000a  H.\u000a  H. Very good. I want you to find the letter that makes the sound that you hear at the beginning of the word "worm." Worm.\u000a  W. W.\u000a  What letter?\u000a  W!\u000a  Good job. We have been talking about spring and we have been talking about the seasons of summer and winter and springtime. What season are we in right now?\u000a  Winter.\u000a  Winter. Very good. Well this book, "Hedgehog is Hungry," that's written by Beverley Randell, is about a hedgehog. And he is asleep during the wintertime. And he wakes up in the springtime and he is hungry. But first, look at this picture. Have y'all ever seen anything like this before?\u000a  No.\u000a  I saw a hedgehog in a book, but not real.\u000a  You've seen a hedgehogs before in a book but not real?\u000a  Not me.\u000a  Hedgehogs are pokey. And when they curl up, their little spikes poke out. They pop up. That's right. Why do you think they pop up?\u000a  Cuz that means you're scared.\u000a  That means they're scared.\u000a  Nature protects.  If a person runs into the pointy stuff, they'll say, "Ouch."\u000a  That's right. And it protects them. Well, as we are reading this book today we're going to read this book to find out what Hedgehog is going to eat. What Hedgehog is hungry for, and what he is going to eat. I want you to look at your partner, and I want you to tell your partner what you think hedgehog might eat? \u000a  I am thinking he, is going to eat a worm.\u000a  I think he is going to eat a snail.\u000a  Okay. Alright. Well, I heard I heard worm, and I heard snail. And she said snail too. Why do you both think the hedgehog is going to eat a snail?\u000a  Because there's one right in front of it.\u000a  I think it's going to eat a worm.\u000a  You think it's going to eat a worm?\u000a  I think he's going to eat a leaf.\u000a  You think he might eat leaves. Okay. Alright. So, we're going to read this book to find out what Hedgehog is going to eat. Alright, why are we reading this book?\u000a  To find out what Hedgehog is going to eat.\u000a  But guess what? There's going to be some words in this book that we might not know how to read. One of the words we are going to work on today is new high-frequency word. And remember, high-frequency words there aren't any rules for them, are they? We just have to learn the way they look, so that we can learn to read them. Can you read, tell me what this word is? \u000a  Here.\u000a  This is the word "here." I love how you decoded it.\u000a  We already learned about it.\u000a  We have learned about here. Here is on our...\u000a  Word wall.\u000a  Word wall, isn't it? Excellent job! Well, today it is important that you not only know how to read words, but it's important that you also know how to spell words. So, I'm going to give you the letters that you need. I want you to dump them out, and I want you to spell "here" for me. I'm going to turn this around so you can't look at it. And I want you to spell "here" for me. I hear Lilly saying it's . Here.\u000a  I spelled it.\u000a  Alright, I'm going to turn it back around. Are you all ready? Alright, check it!\u000a  H-E-R-E\u000a  I did it!\u000a  Are you all right?  What word did you just build?\u000a  Here.\u000a  Here. Alright, now we can build it, so I want you to... write it. I want you to write the word "here". Not look at your letters. Okay. Are you ready? Show me how you write the word "here". And then I'll let you check it again. You're almost there. What else do you think comes next?\u000a  I think you push harder.\u000a  You want to try pushing harder? You think you got it, Natalia?\u000a  I put an exclamation mark. Here!\u000a  You put an exclamation mark at the end.\u000a  I spelled it.\u000a  You did? Alright, I'm going to turn it around. You all ready to check it? \u000a  Did you get it? Alright, read your word.\u000a  Here.\u000a  Here. Very good.\u000a  H-A-R-E, here.\u000a  Here.\u000a  It's not, A.\u000a  Alright, now, one way that we can help ourself is by looking at high-frequency words, and learning all of our high-frequency words. Our high-frequency words are on our word wall. So, that's one place that you can look if you get stuck. Another thing that we can do is we can look at the pictures to help us with the tricky part. So, we're going to go through, and that's what we're going to do right now. We are going to look at the pictures. Are you ready? "Hedgehog is hungry". That's our title. Now, what time of year do you think it is?\u000a  Winter.\u000a  Winter. It is definitely winter.\u000a  Because all of the leaves are off the tree.\u000a  Because all of the leaves are off the tree. Alright let's look at the pictures. Now, who do you see buried down in the leaves there?\u000a  I see Hedgehog.\u000a  You see Hedgehog. Is Hedgehog awake or is he asleep?\u000a  Asleep.\u000a  And you know why he's asleep?\u000a  Because it's winter and he hibernated.\u000a  And he's hibernating. Very good, turn to the next page. Now what season is it? What season is it?\u000a  It's spring.\u000a  It's spring! And is Hedgehog still asleep?\u000a  No.\u000a  No. Hedgehog is awake. Let's turn to the next page. And there he goes. Here he comes. He's going out for a little walk. What do you think he's doing?\u000a  Find something to eat.\u000a  He's going to find something to eat. Let's turn to the next page. Hedgehog is hungry. And what is the first thing he finds? He finds a...\u000a  Snail.\u000a  I was right!\u000a  Uh, you were right.\u000a  And me.\u000a  Okay, let's turn to the next page. He's still hungry.\u000a  He ate worms and caterpillar.\u000a  Okay, now that is a very big word, caterpillar. How did you all know that that was the word "caterpillar?"\u000a  I saw it right there.\u000a  Alright, listen closely. You all just told me two strategies you can use to help yourself when you come to a tricky word. You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound. Or, you can look at the... pictures. Tell me again. You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound. Or you can look at the...\u000a  pictures.\u000a  Okay, let's turn to the next page. Now, what does he find? What is that? Okay, we talked about one of the strategies is we can get our mouth ready for the beginning sound.\u000a \u000a  Alright, let's run our finger underneath it now. Let's look at it. Let me write it. Let's do, "Bug". Let's spell bug and see. How would we spell bug? Get your arms ready.\u000a  \u000a  Is that going to be the word bug?\u000a  No.\u000a  No. So we're going to have to look at that. This is the word "beetle." Can you say that word?\u000a  Beetle.\u000a  And look underneath it. What do you see underneath it? That is a slug. Ooooh. Now, just like-- eyes are up here, Lilly. Eyes are up here. Okay there we go. Just like we can get our mouth ready for the beginning sound, you all also know how to decode words, Is everybody's eyes up here? So, we can get our mouth ready for the beginning blend, which is, sl... What sound is the U going to make?\u000a  Uh.\u000a  Because there's only one vowel. And what sound's the G going to make?\u000a  Guh.\u000a  Let's blend it together.  Are you ready?\u000a  Sl-u-g. Slug.\u000a  Now, look at me. You have three ways now. You can look at the pictures. You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound. And you can decode words that have one vowel in them. Alright, let's close our book up. All the way up. When you are reading, I want you to read to find out what Hedgehog eats. What is your purpose for reading?\u000a  To find out what hedgehog eats.\u000a  Alright, start reading. Hedgehog is hungry. \u000a  What did we say he was? Use the pictures to help you with the tricky part. We said he was a... asleep.\u000a  Asleep.\u000a  Good job.\u000a  It wasn't doing that space in there.\u000a  That's right because  "asleep" is one word.  There's our high-frequency word: "here." \u000a  I'm tricked.\u000a  You're tricked. Alright, so what will you do?\u000a  H-un-gry\u000a  Hungry.\u000a  Very good. Hedgehog is hungry. \u000a  Good job. \u000a  Slug.\u000a  Good job. \u000a  It does spell the word "spring." Good job. Alright. I love the way you all did two things: I love the way you can all use your fingers to help you point. I saw Lilly stretching lots of words out. When she came to a word that she didn't know, she got her mouth ready and she stretched those out just like we did with the word "slug". I saw Poniyota using the pictures help her with the tricky part. We are reading to find out what hedgehog ate. Do you remember what hedgehog ate?\u000a  Snails.\u000a  He ate snails. What was something else he ate?\u000a  A snail.\u000a  A snail. What was  something else he ate?\u000a  A bug.\u000a  A bug. What was something else he ate?\u000a  He ate a beetle bug.\u000a  A beetle bug. Alright, let's read it and make it sound like talking.\u000a  Hedgehog is hungry. Hedgehog is hungry. Winter is here. Hedgehog is asleep. Spring is here. Hedgehog wakes up. Here comes hedgehog.\u000a  Let's all get together. Here we go:\u000a  Hedgehog is hungry. Here is a snail. Hedgehog is hungry. Here is a worm. Here is a caterpillar. Here is a beetle. Here is a slug. Hedgehog is hungry in the spring.\u000a  Very good job. I am very proud of you all.\u000a

V  I see lots of different levels of tennis. I see some balancing levels. Blake, why do you choose to balance this? Who wants to share? \u000a  Keeping that ball controlled. Back to back. Catching placement, find a partner, and standing with equipment on the ground. I've got two groups ready, equipment's on the ground. You're looking for somebody you may have not worked with already. You should have found a partner. If not, you guys will start. Thank you for placing the equipment down on the ground. Lost and found? Lost and found always come to the start, very good. When I say go, you're going to turn to your partner, I want you to talk to them about what is a lifetime activity? What I have on the board over here, and I also have it on my screen. Lifetime activity, what does it mean to have a lifetime activity? What does the word lifetime mean? Go. \u000a  Bryan: soccer, baseball... Maybe not.\u000a  Soccer?\u000a  Maybe one of those, yeah maybe it could be, yeah soccer.\u000a  Volleyball?\u000a  Yeah, volleyball \u000a  And five, four, three, two, and one. My partner and I, Zachary, had some really good examples of what lifetime means, so I'm gonna use his. Zachary said that lifetime means you do it now, as a third grader, but we could do it later in life as an adult. Raise your hand if that's what you and your partner kinda said? It's something you should be able to do later in life? Very good. And then we gave each other an idea of what some activities could be that we could do now and later in life. Zachary said two cool ones, "tennis." Anybody else say tennis? Awesome, pat yourself on the back. And he also said "bowling," and the reason those two are really good examples for having now as a third grader, and later in life is that they're pretty good on your body. You can still do 'em, they're not gonna injure your body too much. It's gonna make you strong and healthy. We have an organ in our body that really needs to be worked out. We've talked about aerobic capacity. And tennis will make your heart beat faster. You have to find something that's gonna make the heart beat faster. So now turn to your partner, talk about what you're gonna choose to make your heart beat faster. Go. \u000a  And five, four, three, two, one. Pat yourself on your back for your lifetime activity, that you're gonna choose, nice job. When I say go, you are your partner are now gonna travel back to any open area and stand back in face-off position. So this is where my partner and I came, and we put our equipment down. Then we'll turn and look at the board. Ready? Go. Looking for an open spot with a partner. Thank you for carrying your equipment quickly and quietly. Now, we're transitioning now to talk about working with a partner and doing some tennis challenges. So far, we've worked by ourselves to be responsible learners Brian, are you looking for your partner? He's right here. So now we can work with a partner and be responsible learners. On the screen is one of the challenges we did with the balloons yesterday. Zachary and Ms. Rock will show you an example of what you could practice. We're gonna actually skip this level today, but you could choose it, if you said "Hey you know what, let's go back to this other level." So Zachary and Ms. Rock both have our rackets, we're gonna practice underhand striking keep up. Raise your hand if you remember that? Awesome. Alright, here it is. I tick, step, tock, and he's gonna strike back or he can catch it, and then I'm gonna keep striking. We're gonna keep our paddles low, go ahead. Alright, I'm gonna wait 'til it gets low so I can strike, he's gonna also wait 'til it gets low to strike. Keeping that paddle low. We're trying to keep it up as long as we can. Awesome. So that was the first level. Striking, keep up with the balloon. Now we're gonna move to bean bag challenges with a partner. Super duper cool. It looks like this. Only one person will need a bean bag. Since I'm closest to the wall, I'm the person to have the bean bag first. I'm going to be the underhand thrower. Zachary, go ahead and pick up your racket. Create a flat surface. I'm going to underhand throw, he's going to catch it on his racket. Take a step, tock. Good try. You might have to reach out and get under it. Now he's gonna leave it on his racket, and he's gonna underhand throw it back from his racket to my hands. Go ahead. Take a step, tock. I catch, alright? He needs to have three tries with the racket, then it's my turn to have three tries with the racket. Thumbs up if you understand. Down if you got a question. Alright. Person closest to the wall, you will pick up your partners ball and switch out one bean bag. Bring it back, and place it in your racket. Go. Quickly, quickly, and five, four, three, two, one. You should have one bean bag back on your tennis racket. Raise your hand if you have a question. So, partner with the beanbag go ahead and pick it up. You're the tosser first, with your hands. You only need the beanbag. You only have the beanbag. Grab your place on your side. Thank you, Christopher, for being safe. We're gonna move through these challenges fairly quickly. We're gonna see how far we get. We're gonna be responsible, if the beanbag is not working so well, you can go back to a--?\u000a  Balloon.\u000a  Balloon. Alright, let's practice. Go. One catching on their racket, one catching on their hand. I hear good communication with a partner. You have to help each other. \u000a  One person is underhand throwing, one person is catching. Awesome, if you haven't switched jobs, go ahead and switch jobs at this time. If you haven't switched jobs. \u000a  See how many good catches you can get. Give yourself a point for each catch. Hands or racket. Are you using the opposite foot to step back with? Both partners pick up rackets. Both partners pick up rackets. Look at the board now, you're gonna see the toss from racket to racket challenge. Count how many you can get. Go.  There you go, Zach. Excellent\u000a  One.\u000a  And freeze.   Alright, from here, I'm going to now make you and your partner be responsible learners. We have learned to use a bean bag with a partner. We're gonna now learn how to use both a foam ball, and a large tennis trainer. Both of these offer different challenges. The first one is a foam ball. As you can see on the screen, they now have a foam ball. Zachary picks up his racket. We are doing an underhand strike back and forth. But like we did with the tennis ball, we can also catch it on our tennis racket at any time we need to. So, Zachary do you think if I tossed this to you, you could try catching it? Alright, let's see. Nice! He had to figure out how to keep that balance on here. He's gonna do the same thing back to me. This is just working on looking for that ball, getting our feet to it, and keeping a flat surface. We can do the catching with the ball, now we're ready for the tap offs. Remember what we did with the balloon? We're gonna try to keep the foam ball up. This is what it looks like. Tap, tap, good try. It went away a little bit, stop it, we come back. I tick, step, tock. Good. We're keeping a flat surface coming back, slanted out. The lower the racket, the better control we will have. I want the racket to stay at a slant to partner. Can you say that?\u000a  Slant to partner.\u000a  So that's the foam ball challenge. Some of you may just stay with the foam ball. But, if you're like: "I wanna challenge myself and my partner," I say "Zachary, we can now use the tennis trainer". And, it's going to bounce,strike, bounce,strike. The bouncing is gonna bounce here, before I hit it, then it will bounce in the middle, then my partner will strike. Okay? Ready Zachary? So, it's a bounce strike, bounce strike. Excellent. And I would come back and start it over again if I need to. Bounce strike, bounce strike, bounce strike, bounce strike. Catch when needed. Were we controlled? Yeah! When it got out of control, we caught it. So from here on out, you now have balloon to challenge yourself and a partner with, bean bag, What came next?\u000a  Foam Ball\u000a  And then?\u000a  Tennis trainer.\u000a  Excellent. See how far you get with the partner you're working with. This uses communication and cooperation. Say that.\u000a  Communication and cooperation.\u000a  Excellent. This is how it would look: Zachary, what piece of equipment would you like for us to use? Or you think you're ready?\u000a  The...\u000a  The foam ball? Or the balloon? What did you say?\u000a  The end one.\u000a  The end. He said he wanted to use the tennis trainer. "W" for Wilson, it's the brand. I said, "Oh you know what Zachary, "I don't feel like I'm ready for this one. "Can we go back to a foam ball first?" And he said "yes". I'm all "phew, thank you". We just had communication and cooperation. I know that I can practice with this one for a little longer I'll probably be ready for the challenge. Alright, ready, go. \u000a  Are you able to keep your paddles low? Keeping that balloon or that piece of equipment nice and controlled. Are you using an underhand strike?  Alright, ready Zachary? Bounce strike, bounce strike-- let it bounce one time. Bounce strike, bounce strike, good. Bounce strike, bounce strike, bounce strike, bounce strike. Now I'm going to give you a challenge, so I can go around the room and see if anyone needs help. You'll just work on tap ups, you can use any equipment that you need, okay? Tap ups, or tap downs. If you and your partner need a little help, you can always raise your hand, and I can come over. Try to review those cues with you. Underhand strike.  Okay bounce strike, bounce strike, bounce strike. Okay, say that, bounce strike. Okay, and if it's not working, then you and your partner need to say... "We need to go back to the--" Be responsible, try it again though. Bounce strike, bounce strike Ooh this is where, Aiyah, did she step with her opposite foot? Did you step when you strike? No, so it's key to step when you strike. You gotta step. Try it again. Keeping those paddles low. If you and your partner have to move off of your self space a lot, that's a reflection, you should say "Ooh, we A, need help or B, let's go to a different level." Responsible word I hear. Which piece of equipment are you going to have the most success with? And freeze. \u000a  Equipment should be  back on our rackets. Now, I see students at all different levels. So that shares with me that we have some very responsible learners in the class, which is excellent. But now, we're gonna see if you can switch it up a bit, and give yourself a challenge. You should be able to work with anybody. So what I'm gonna have you do is, let's see here, Ellie, Ellie is gonna step over here, come jogging down, all the way down to where Zachary is. Yay Ellie! Ellie is gonna slide down one, and that's gonna make everyone in this row slide down to a new partner. Where you going? Very good, Zachary. And then you go one down, yep, there you go. Now, wave to your new partner. Excellent. Same thing here, Harrison, come on down. \u000a And slide on down. Wave to your new partner. Now you all of a sudden have to have more communication, because you don't know where this partner is at. Ready? Go. Talk, which one are you gonna do? \u000a

V  Gina.\u000a I wanted to test the amount of acid in different brands of antacids, example Alka-Seltzer, Maalox and Tums, can effectively neutralize.\u000a Okay, so far we've been listening to this, are we talking mostly the same equipment, same supplies?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Right? Maybe some beakers, maybe some pipettes and some base? Right? Okay, is this similar to, Juan's? This one is, right? So maybe we can start grouping these two together. Christina.\u000a The goal of my investigation is to determine which laundry detergent is most effective, Tide, Clorox, or OxyClean by determining which is most basic.\u000a Any concerns? Yeah? Adrian?\u000a How do you know that the most effective detergents are gonna be the most basic? Maybe there's some other factors that go into that and they're, it's just, basic-ness.\u000a Juan?\u000a That some of them have really strong bases and maybe the vapors, I mean, Some of them have safety warnings that say like, don't get too close to the vapors that come out.\u000a Okay, so there could be some toxic chemicals that are associated with these which is why we shouldn't use them? Is that what you mean?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, okay, we use them in our homes, but don't bring them to school, right?\u000a Yeah, I'm a little concerned too, about your idea that it's about which one is most basic. Okay? 'Cause the active ingredient in Clorox, I think, is bleach, and bleach--\u000a Sodium hypochlorite.\u000a Is sodium hypochlorite.\u000a Which has a pretty interesting smell.\u000a I'd stay away from that. And then we have Tide, right? Tide is not bleach, all right? I'm not sure what the actual detergent, active ingredient is, but I'm pretty sure it's not bleach. So, this is probably going to require some cleaning up and making sure that we test something that we can test, and that it makes sense why we're testing it. Okay? All right, we'll come back to this.\u000a And OxyClean is powered by Billy Mays, so it doesn't matter, it wins anyway.\u000a I think he died, didn't he?\u000a Yeah he did, it's too bad.\u000a You know, that guy must have made so much money, I better not complain.\u000a Adrian! Go ahead.\u000a I will find the molarity of one of the magnesium sulfate bottles in the lab inventory. To do this I'll mix 50 milliliters of magnesium sulfate with 50 milliliters of one molar calcium chloride in a beaker. I'll mix it to form a precipitate of calcium sulfate. After as much precipitate as possible has formed I'll weigh the precipitate and calculate the molarity of the magnesium sulfate solution with the data collected.\u000a Any ideas? Jimmy?\u000a I'm kinda wondering why it's important to you, like you said, to make the lab meaningful.\u000a Yeah, it should be. So Adrian, do you have a response?\u000a It's just 'cause bottles that don't have molarity kind of annoy me, and I feel like I should, there should be like a label that says the molarity, I just kinda...\u000a You know my room is open fifth period every day, you can come on in and do these experiments and get them so that you know their concentrations.\u000a I don't have a free fifth period.\u000a After school's fine too.\u000a That's cool, that's cool.\u000a What concerns me is, I thought the theme was titration, right? Is the theme titration? Okay, where is the titration aspect to this? Do you know what I'm asking here?\u000a Yeah, I know, I just didn't realize.\u000a Because you're mixing, you're doing a precipitate reaction, everybody see it that way. I think you're doing a precipitate reaction and, so I just feel like, you know, this, you had the wrong theme going on here. Anyway, we'll move on. Nicholas, Artel, Artel. Sirhan Sirhan, although he was a bad man, though I think, right? He was accused of being a bad man. Go ahead!\u000a The goal of my investigation is to see which of two pills have more Vitamin C per pills and weigh them to 100 milligrams and cut away mass as appropriate, crush them, dissolve in water and use a base to titrate it. I would also use a pH sensor to see what the solution, to see when the solution is at seven, to see when it's neutralized. Doing this will let me know which company I should buy from for my Vitamin C pills.\u000a What do you guys think? Vitamin C is ascorbic acid, I don't know if you wrote that. Did you? No, okay, so if it's an acid, you can titrate it, right? Is anybody concerned about, like, anything here? Jimmy?\u000a Don't the pills tell you how much Vitamin C is in them? Like, the bottle?\u000a Wait, let me make sure, if you buy a Vitamin C that says 100 milligrams of Vitamin C, my assumption is when you pull out one of them tablets, and you crush it and you do this experiment, it's gonna be close to that 100 milligrams. So are you testing because you think they're not accurate?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Oh! Okay, so you're testing for accuracy on their part, just to keep them honest.\u000a Because, I mean, 100 milligrams, it's kind of a, non-specific number.\u000a All right, Ian?\u000a Actually, another way you could look at it is that, just because it says 100 milligrams, that's how much of the Vitamin C is in it, that's not how big the tablet is. Being that sometime, I mean you could have, and say, just arbitrary numbers, you could have a 500 milligram tablet that has that 100 milligrams of vitamin C, or you could have a 200 milligram tablet with that same 100 milligrams of vitamin C, so you might wanna know which one actually had more stuff in it, actually had more stuff in it per, density.\u000a Okay but, is that what you want him to do, I thought, are you doing it because you wanna make sure that when they write 100, you don't care how big this tablet is, unless, unless, what's the danger here? Some of that other that tablet contains, acids or bases in them, then that would affect your results, right?\u000a One of them I have is pretty pure, it's pretty much just ascorbic acid, the other company I have does have some other stuff in it, so I was wondering if anybody else had like one that was mostly Vitamin C.\u000a Have you ever been to like, the CVS and looked in the section--\u000a I mean, I could find one I just haven't--\u000a There's a bunch, you could even--\u000a What'd you guys figure out?\u000a It's turning yellow.\u000a Why do you think it's doing that?\u000a Maybe the bicarbonate when it dissolves, gets out some CO2 and turns it acidic. I didn't think it would be that big of a deal because--\u000a Wait! Hang on, so you mean, so far what you've done is you've crushed these things you tried to dissolve them and you added some bromothymol blue?\u000a Yeah.\u000a And, that bromothymol blue is not quite the color that you want?\u000a That's right.\u000a That's what you're saying?\u000a Yeah.\u000a What color should it be?\u000a Blue, I guess. It's kind of, green. It just looks as if this coloring is just, green dye.\u000a Have you thought about using like phenolphthalein? That has a distinctly pink color, otherwise it's clear.\u000a No, we did not think of that.\u000a You wanna try that?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah, that'd be better. \u000a So, the phenolphthalein is gonna be, it's probably going to be behind... - If it's pink it's acidic right?\u000a No, if it's basic. \u000a Do the bubbles matter?\u000a All right, could I just stop and ask you guys, did you guys get your color change you were looking for?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So the titration is working out?\u000a  Yep.\u000a Very clean.\u000a What? So, tell me what you got here?\u000a This is a disinfecting Clorox, we're just starting out, we're just trying to measure out 10 milliliters. That one we're done with, we got it to the brown, like, it didn't stir anymore, that was it.\u000a That's as far as it went?\u000a We put in 61 and that was it. Now we're going to start this one. And that worked with the one molar.\u000a So is this, oh, so this is a different concentration? Or how is this one different, this is just a different--\u000a This is a different type, and it's a different percentage of the hypochlorate.\u000a That's disinfecting spray and that's bleach.\u000a With a different type of Clorox cleaning product.\u000a All right. Did you make sure that mixing some of these would not produce anything poisonous?\u000a No, we did not make sure. But they're--\u000a I just wanna, you know, we don't wanna create any of these strange gases coming out of here.\u000a When we looked at the reaction this is the reaction that they showed on the thing. And this was fine, like it said it should be done in basic and everything.\u000a Okay.\u000a God bless you.\u000a Excuse me. \u000a How's everything going?\u000a Not good with this one.\u000a What's in there?\u000a It's red wine vinegar.\u000a But it hasn't changed color.\u000a The treatment's too powerful.\u000a Yeah, we're thinking it's too...\u000a So, we're gonna do the white--\u000a What's the solution to that, then? Why don't you just use less?\u000a Less of the vinegar?\u000a Right. All right?\u000a So we use five milliliters instead of\u000a Well, I mean, right? If you use less, then don't you think you'll be able to titrate it--\u000a Easier.\u000a Well, you'd need less base to get there.\u000a Right.\u000a Okay.\u000a Let's go over here, see what happens over here. \u000a So, squeeze that out.\u000a What are you guys, so you've got Vitamin C, crushed in there, you used, is this bromothymol blue, what did you use?\u000a Yeah, we used BTB, and now we're gonna see how much base we used.\u000a Just out of curiosity, why did you use a graduat--, what is this about, 50? You didn't want to use like... 'Cause that is, are you gonna--\u000a All the other ones were like dirty.\u000a Yeah, they were kinda...\u000a And I think this is accurate to two sig figs which is our experiment's limit. \u000a All right, coming along okay it looks like.\u000a  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,\u000a Hi!\u000a You're adding 20 drops of bromothymol blue?\u000a Yeah. Is that too much?\u000a Well, has it occurred to you, and it probably hasn't, it's okay, bromothymol blue itself is either a weak, my guess is it's a weak acid, it could be a weak base, but all indicators are going to be weak acids and bases. So, we always want to use a bare minimum amount. Therefore, how about if you use something that has a distinct color change, roughly at the, neutral point, like phenolphthalein. 'Cause then it'll go from pink, your...\u000a This is acid.\u000a These are acids, so they'll go from clear to a pinkish color.\u000a Okay, okay, but do you think the pink will be able to be seen?\u000a Well--\u000a Like the blue one?\u000a You know, the blue you need to use a lot more to get there, although, I don't know, I suppose since you already did this one--\u000a I mean, we could remeasure, out--\u000a You may wanna, well, we don't want to run out of time here, so, right? Stay consistent and then consider it, how you can make improvements later.\u000a Okay.\u000a All right?  \u000a Now that's very nice.\u000a You guys have questions?\u000a What was your results in comparing what the company says and what you--\u000a There was a little bit less, since we used 500 milligrams and the company labeled it as pretty much pure, pure ascorbic acid. As in the first trials it was around 480 per kil to, which is, it's pretty close and the other one was around than what you're probably paying for. But--\u000a But that's, then again, it could've been, because--\u000a Because not all the powder dissolved, some of it was still settled on the bottom.\u000a So they could be really accurate?\u000a Yeah they could be, you know, dead on.\u000a For the trials, did you guys use different amounts of stuff, for the two trials?\u000a For the first two trials we used 500 milligrams of powder for each pill, and then, for the third trial we used 100, right? A hundred.\u000a And then for those trials, like the third one you said you used a different concentration of NaOH?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Why did you use a different concentration?\u000a First of all there wasn't much left of the .567, and also, you know, who's to--, you know, maybe that could've been contaminated, it might not have been .567, so it's also good to use some different stuff sometimes.\u000a Right.\u000a You can't always base it, you can't have it all on one thing.\u000a Yeah, that's smart.\u000a How did yo actually figure out the amounts? What was the math?\u000a  Oh!\u000a We did the stoichiometry.\u000a Yeah, but we assumed that it was a one-to-one ratio, one hydrogen ion dissolved from the ascorbic acid from one OH from the base. And so we just calculated moles and changed moles to grams using the formula mass of Vitamin C.\u000a Do you know with certainty that ascorbic acid is one H plus?\u000a No we just assumed that, for the experiment.\u000a Maybe you should look that up.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah.\u000a The other thing, anybody else? So the other thing is, and I just wanna make sure, when you said 500 milligrams, that's .5 grams, right?\u000a We did it accurate with--\u000a Yeah, 'cause that thing, the scales here give you two sig figs, right? Okay, I mean to the hundredths, hundredths of a gram, right? So you crush this thing and you weighed out .50?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a That's what you did it? How much was left in the... ; I mean, of one tablet, when you, you know what I mean? When you crush it?\u000a Yeah--\u000a How much--\u000a We had excess, I mean, one of the pills I had was 1000 milligrams, so we, you know, we had about, we had a, like, about,\u000a It is my fault for--\u000a Oh, you were using 1000 milligram tablets.\u000a And then my pill was 500 milligrams and then we weighed them and it was actually six five seven, like milligrams.\u000a That's how we removed--\u000a So we had to-- we removed mass.\u000a Oh, well how 'bout this, if it, if they say 500, but the thing weighs six... What'd you say, six or seven hundred?\u000a Oh yeah.\u000a Then, aren't there other ingredients already in there?\u000a Not that were listed, like--\u000a Yeah, they weren't listed--\u000a It just said, it just said Vitamin C--\u000a Because they might just list the active ingredient, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a In other words, if the pill itself weighs more than the 500 that they claim, my guess would be there's more of something else.\u000a Okay.\u000a Because here's another thing. Don't you need possibly a binding agent to keep all the Vitamin C in a clump? Do you see what I'm saying?\u000a  Yeah , yeah.\u000a And they'll typically use, some, there's gonna be some certain chemicals they're gonna use that's in there. So I have a feeling before you write the company, be careful, they're--\u000a  Yeah, yeah.\u000a They probably added other ingredients.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Because what I think might've been even better is if they claim 500, then why don't you just crush the whole thing, regardless of how much it weighs? And then titrate that. You see what I'm saying?\u000a  Yes.\u000a 'Cause then, they're claiming there's the... You see what I'm saying?\u000a So that would be taking further just simply--\u000a Yeah, that would be--\u000a The experiment.\u000a Wouldn't that be like the next--\u000a Yeah.\u000a Thing that you could try? Same thing with 1000, right? I mean if they claim 1000.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Go crush the whole thing and see what--\u000a

V  Okay guys, good morning and welcome to class today. We're going to continue our discussion on energy, but we're going to extend it to cover some new points that we haven't talked about yet. So what I'd like for you to do first before we get started with out discussion is look at the big idea, the big idea for just a moment. So the big idea that we're going to talk about today is how do you think the sun is going to help you shoot the stretchy lizard across the table? So everybody's got their little stretchy lizard. Without shooting them, we're not doing anything with them yet, I'd like for you to talk in your table group and see if you can come up with a big idea. I'm going to give you and then we'll just go around and see what you think. Okay, so 30 seconds to think about what's the big idea.   Do you know who your spokesperson is going to be?\u000a   \u000a  Alright guys, it's been 30 seconds. I'm going to go to each table. If you could just have your spokesperson ready, you could just tell me what your big idea is. We're going to put it up here and we're going to come back to it at the end of class and see how we've done. Alright, so how about we'll start with you guys back here since there's just two of you. Alright, what do you think? Shawn, are you going to speak?\u000a  The sun would warm up the lizard and make it go across the table.\u000a  Okay, so the sun might warm up the lizard. I just put L for lizard, that's alright, and make it go across the table. Robert, how about your table, who's your spokesperson going to be?\u000a  The energy from the sun, once it shines on the lizard it would give the lizard energy.\u000a  Okay, the energy from the sun will shine on the lizard. Right, is that okay? Who's your spokesperson?\u000a  We said that the sun might make the lizard melt and make it sticky and then maybe it would shoot across the table.\u000a  Okay, so it might make it melt and sticky and that'll make it shoot across the table. Is that what you said? Alright, Kendrick who's your spokesperson going to be?\u000a  Blaire\u000a  It was unanimous. Alright, Blaire, what do you guys have?\u000a  We were going to say things like the other people said that like the energy from the sun is going...\u000a  Is going to do what?\u000a  Like the energy from the sun would like shine on the lizard and it's going to make it jump\u000a  Okay. Shine and make it jump. Nicole, did you guys decide who your spokesperson's going to be?\u000a  Arrington.\u000a  Arrington.\u000a  The sun would gives energy to the lizard to help it sling.\u000a  Okay, so the sun gives energy and I didn't hear the last part. You want to tell me?\u000a  That helps it.\u000a  That helps it, okay. And last but not least, Jada?\u000a  We think that the sun give heat to the  and make it more elastic so it would stretch.\u000a  Okay, so the sun would give heat to make it more elastic? I'm sorry, what was the last part again?\u000a  Like make it more elastic so it will stretch more.\u000a  So it'll stretch farther, good. Alright, so what I'd like to do now is I'd like to just kind of recall some of the things that we might already know about energy. So if I call your number, I would like you to think about what do you know about, let's start with potential energy. What do you know about potential energy? So if I call your number just tell me one factor, one thing that you know about it or an example of it. Alright, we'll start with 15.\u000a  When an object is like still, it doesn't move, it's holding it in.\u000a  Okay, still, doesn't move, it's holding it in. How about number eight? Robert. Something you know about potential energy or an example of it.\u000a  The lizards.\u000a  Alright, very good. When the lizard is still? When it's moving, what do you think?\u000a  Still?\u000a  Alright, very good.\u000a  It's stored energy.\u000a  Alright, it's stored energy and I'll do one more, number two. Potential energy. An example or something that you remember about it.\u000a  The pencil is still.\u000a  The pencil is still. Alright, very good. Now I know we haven't talked about these topics too much yet, but I know from your pretest you guys had a lot of background knowledge on it. Okay, the next thing I'd like to know is what do you know, what examples do you have, what can you remember about kinetic energy. So we talked about potential. Now I'd like to know a couple things that you might know about kinetic energy. Alright, so if I call your number let me know what you think. Number 20?\u000a  A car moving.\u000a  A car moving. Alright, number 13.\u000a  A paint can being dropped.\u000a  A paint can being dropped, alright, very good. Number 14.\u000a  When you push a pencil and it rolls.\u000a  Alright, when you push a pencil and it rolls, very good. And how about number seven, we'll do one more.\u000a  Like the energy of motion,  like the .\u000a  The energy of motion?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Thanks. Alright, and if I didn't call your number and you want to contribute about either potential or kinetic. Anybody have anything else to add about it? Dylan?\u000a  Kinetic is when like the stored energy from the potential energy leaks all out and it starts pulling.\u000a  Alright, very good and that's a great way to start into the next part, what we're going to use the lizards for today. Alright, so what I would like to know from you guys, is everybody has a bucket on their table, right?\u000a  Um-hum, yeah.\u000a -Teacher] Okay. And you can raise your hand for this part: how can you, from your seat, how can you make the stretchy lizard get into the bucket? Anthony.\u000a  Shoot it.\u000a  You can shoot it.\u000a  You can just toss it in.\u000a  You can just toss it in there.\u000a  You could pull its tail.\u000a  You could pull its tail and stretch it.\u000a  You could drop it in there.\u000a  You could just drop it in there. It's not too far away. Anybody else? Okay, how about, and I'm not asking for a demonstration yet, we'll get to demonstration, I promise. How about if I asked you guys, instead of in the bucket at your table, how could you get it into a bucket at your neighbor's table? At your neighbor's table? Javious, what do you think?\u000a  You could toss it.\u000a  You could toss it. Arrington.\u000a  You could sling it.\u000a  You could sling it. Wilson. That was your idea? Alright.\u000a  Walk over there and put it in it.\u000a  Yeah that's true. I didn't say you had to stay in your seat did I? You could walk over there and just put it in. Gavin.\u000a  You could like throw it.\u000a  You might throw it. Is that what you were going to say Dana? Alright.\u000a  Shoot it.\u000a  You could shoot it, alright, very good.\u000a  You could bend it back.\u000a  Yep, you could bend it back and shoot, very good. How about if I asked you to shoot it from one side of the room to the other? Jade, I'll start with you.\u000a  Sling it.\u000a  You could sling it. Lewis.\u000a  Like you said, you could shoot it.\u000a  Yeah, you could shoot it. Anthony.\u000a  You could throw it.\u000a  You could throw it. So we're kind of hearing the same things, right? We're kind of hearing-- Go ahead.\u000a  You could walk over and drop it.\u000a  You could walk over and drop it. I didn't say you had to stay in your seat. Alright. What would be the difference, though, between the bucket at your table, the bucket your neighbor's table, shooting it across the room, going out on the football field and going for distance? What would be the difference between what you did? What difference would you have between this bucket here, the bucket at your neighbor's table and so forth? John, what do you think?\u000a  The amount of energy you're putting into it.\u000a  Can you just show me without actually shooting it, for example?\u000a  Like if you're trying to get it into this bucket, I only have to go like this or drop it in there. If I were trying to send it across the room I'd have to really stretch it out.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  The distance away from the bucket.\u000a  Okay, so what would you do differently to make it go a different distance?\u000a  Stretch it more.\u000a  I might stretch it further, is that what you two were going to say?\u000a  The more potential energy or kinetic energy it has.\u000a  The more potential energy, the more kinetic energy it has? So when you talk about the lizard, what do you mean when you say the potential energy that it has? How's it getting potential energy? What does that mean?\u000a  Before you sling it, it's just sitting there-- .\u000a  Alright, so when it's just sitting there it's potential. What about when you stretch it, what do you think that is?\u000a  Kinetic.\u000a  Okay, have you let it go yet?\u000a  No.\u000a  Alright, so we'll think about that for a little bit. What I'd like for you guys to do is talk to your neighbors at your table, or if you don't like what they have to say, you can think about it on your own. I'd like for you to make a hypothesis and I'd like for your hypothesis to start with "I think" and then think about what we just said about how you would get the lizard in the bucket at your table versus your neighbor's table. What do you think you would do differently? "I think if I", do what to the lizard it's going to go in the bucket at my table versus the one at the next table. So make a hypothesis about how you could test how can you get the lizard in that bucket versus the next one.\u000a  By slinging it.\u000a  Yeah, talk amongst yourselves and see what you guys think. Alright, I'll give you \u000a  But then compare it to the next table as well. What would you have to do differently to the lizard to get it in this bucket versus the next one? That's what I want you to do. Okay, alright. So let me just have... Let's hear one table. Gavin, I kind of liked what I was hearing from yours. Ready guys? Gavin, I liked what I was hearing from your table when I was walking around. Tell me what you guys came up with for a hypothesis.\u000a  That if you were shooting it at your table you'd only pull back a little bit, but if you're shooting it across to another person's table, you'd have to pull it back farther.\u000a  Okay, any other table have a similar hypothesis? So their hypothesis then was if they want to shoot it into the bucket at their table, and correct me if I'm wrong, they'd only have to stretch it a little bit, but if they wanted to shoot it at their neighbor's table, they'd have to stretch it further. Did anybody have a similar hypothesis to that? You guys did. How about you guys, what did you say Nicole?\u000a  We said that maybe we'd have to aim our trajectory much different that we would between tables.\u000a  Okay, so not only the amount of stretch, but also the trajectory of how you aim it. Alright, very good. How about you guys over there?\u000a  You'd have to really aim and focus on how much power you put into it.\u000a  Alright, very good. And I know you guys were coming up with the same thing. So we're going to do an experiment in just a minute to test that hypothesis about the amount of stretch. Is the amount of stretch related to how far your lizard can fly? Okay, so if that's your hypothesis, I think the amount of stretch that I give the lizard will make it fly a different length, what would the manipulated variable be? What would the thing be that you change between the different steps? Anthony.\u000a  How far you pull it back.\u000a  How far you pull it back, very good. How far you pull it or can I put stretch also? Good. What would our dependent variable be? What are you going to watch for? How do you know if that stretch has made a difference? Jada?\u000a  \u000a  Alright, very good and where else might it go?\u000a  \u000a  Right, but you're talking about your bucket and you're also talking about--\u000a  \u000a  Very good. So we're talking about--\u000a  Distance.\u000a  Alright, so can I put that down for the dependent?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Okay, good. How about some constants. What are some things that have to stay the same? Guys, don't let that table do all the work, come on now. Alright, Ada.\u000a  The type of lizard.\u000a  The type of lizard, very good. Would it be fair if I gave one table battery powered and the other table not, right? Alright, very good. Sierra, what else?\u000a  The size and shape of it.\u000a  Size and shape of it, very good. Anything else that has to stay constant or the same?\u000a  How big is the container.\u000a  Alright, very good. How big is the container. Wilson?\u000a  How stretchy it is.\u000a  Okay, how stretchy it is. Alright, I'm going to give you 30 seconds and what I would like for you to do with those 30 seconds, is I'd like for you to practice. Alright, I'd like for you to practice at this point just at your table. If you want to practice on moving the bucket to one end and you guys try from the other end, that's fine, but I would like for you guys to control the lizards so they stay at your area, okay. Alright, go ahead. Without hitting your neighbor. Maybe move to the side, Kendra. Go ahead and practice and see the amount of stretch you give the lizard makes a difference. Gavin. \u000a  See if you have some information when you're done besides that it sticks to your neighbor's head. Alright, hold on and we'll try it again. I promise we'll try it again  at further distances in just a minute. Let's think guys. Can anyone make a conclusion that starts with: "When I change the amount of stretch..."? Can anyone make a conclusion that starts-- Good job. Nicole.\u000a  When I change the amount of stretch... If I change the amount of stretch far then it goes further.\u000a  Okay, if I change the amount of stretch when I make it further, it goes further? Alright, Lewis.\u000a  You might plan for it to go one way, but the way that you shoot it really, it doesn't exactly go where you plan. It's all over the place.\u000a  But if we just focus back to the amount of stretch and the distance--\u000a

V ... and your ideas, and we're learning from each other, right? Because a lot of times, who do we learn from?\u000a You.\u000a Each other.\u000a You learn from me but who else do you learn from?\u000a Us. - You learn from each other. Okay, Kelly if you would move the book away from the projector so we can see the screen. We're going to watch another weather forecast, and as you're viewing this, I want you to pay really close attention to how she...\u000a Talks.\u000a How she speaks. Okay. As a good listener and a viewer, what are some things that we need to concentrate on while we're watching this?\u000a How she, her face, her expression and how she moves and looks.\u000a Okay, and how are you going to find out if she does those things?\u000a By watching her?\u000a You're going to be watching her, okay... Sarah?\u000a Watch how her body is moving because...  Watch her eyes.\u000a Okay, catch your eye. And I like that you said watching. What are you doing while you're watching? Are you just staring at the screen?\u000a No. You are looking at them and you're making eye contact, and you're looking; you're watching their mouths because there are people who can't really hear, so they would read people's mouths, and that's really important to do.\u000a Anything else that you can do while you're viewing this?\u000a Listening.\u000a Okay, and how are you going to be listening? We talked about this a lot. How are we going to listen?\u000a With our ears and with our whole entire bodies.\u000a With our whole entire bodies. Why are we going to listen with our whole entire body? Naomi.\u000a Because if we're listening with our ears, then our hands are up here saying, "Oh, I've got something to say," then you're not really listening, you're not really listening competently.\u000a All right, can you go ahead and hit play for us, please? Yup, just like you did yesterday.\u000a Good afternoon, I'm Julie Wunder with your forecast. A north wind, five to ten miles per hour. Tonight 28, it's going to be partly cloudy out, and we can head to a 7-day forecast. About a 50 percent chance of rain transitioning over to some snow overnight Saturday and into Sunday. Temperatures fall next week, what a cold forecast we have. Coming up at 5 o'clock, we'll have the latest on that possibility of snow.\u000a Turn and talk to your buddy. We're going to do two right here, two, two, two...\u000a I noticed that under one of the clouds we had snow instead of rain. \u000a Turn your face...\u000a Okay and what kind of body language did she use?\u000a She was pointing and ... \u000a So why do you think she was pointing like that? \u000a Okay.\u000a And because you saw her looking at you, did that make you listen any differently? \u000a Did it help you listen more or less? \u000a When she looked away, what was she doing? \u000a Alright, so why do you think she wasn't doing this? Okay like you say, she was like. Why is that? \u000a Would you be listening as well if she were making those faces? Or would you  her face?\u000a Right, not necessarily what she was saying but you were focusing on her expressions. \u000a Alright guys let's come back in three, two, and one. Okay, you guys had some amazing things that you saw when you watched this little clip.\u000a What kind of things did you notice? Tell me what you and your buddy were talking about.\u000a We used this chart. If she was just like there... she was pointing at it so then it made me understand more but if she was just like there... ?\u000a  When you did your presentation, what did you feel like you were looking at?\u000a My poster.\u000a  You looked at your poster the whole time? Okay, and the second time when you did your presentation again, you said you were really focusing on your eye contact, were you able to achieve that goal?\u000a No -  No? Why not?\u000a Because I was looking at my poster again.\u000a  You say you were looking at your poster again. Okay, why do you think you did that? Were you nervous? What do you think you could've done to ease that nervousness?\u000a Take a breath. -  Going to take a breath? What do you guys think? What could Adrian have done to maybe be a little less nervous when he was doing his presentation?\u000a He could think about somewhere he was comfortable.\u000a Okay, think about somewhere where's he's comfortable.\u000a Picture everyone else in their underwear.\u000a Oh, underwear. Sarah.\u000a Be himself and just act like it's just any other day. \u000a The information we were presenting was it a little bit more in depth than what we usually talk about? What do you think? Was the topic you were sharing a little bit, you have a little bit more information than if you were just sitting here having a conversation?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So that make some of us nervous that we have a lot of information trying to remember?\u000a Yes.\u000a And then, was anyone able to get over that nervousness?\u000a Okay. Sarah, how were you guys able to get over that nervousness?\u000a I followed my goals and I just tried to be myself. I just followed my goals and I just had fun.\u000a Okay, do you want to show us part of your presentation where you did that?\u000a Mhmm.\u000a Avril, will you move the book away from the projector while she gets the computer ready? Alright, make sure you get to a spot where you can see. Got it?\u000a My project is about Legends of the  I'm going to start over with Werewolves people think that ... I don't know why because wolves howl at the moon This is a werewolf, a full moon is sometimes called a Wolf's Moon... since its yellow . This one is my favorite. It's about  ... she calls her brother Helius to find her sister Herse.  The study of geography to the moon is called Selenology. Okay this is ...  This is vampires, vampires are said to come out on every moon except for new moon I guess because they can see better. This is a vampire person trying to get his girlfriend to become a vampire. This is people, people think  to people that are aggressive and violent...  This is a witch from... \u000a Okay turn to your buddy for a second. Do you think she was able; she said she acted like she was comfortable. Like it was just any other day.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Talk to your buddy about that. Do you think that she accomplished that goal?\u000a Yes. \u000a Because she's a pretty funny girl, right? Alright. Let's come back together. Let's come back together please. Alright. So her goal, she said that she wanted to be more comfortable. And she was just going to act like it was any other ...\u000a Day.\u000a Did she accomplish that?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay. How do we know that she accomplished that? What do you think Arizona?\u000a  Because she was really comfortable with her surroundings and those people just wanted to get their talking over with and done but Sarah actually talked like we were just talking face to face acting like the camera wasn't even there.\u000a Okay. And as a listener, how did Sarah's confidence make you listen better? Did it make you listen better or did it not make you listen better? It did? Okay. Why did it make you listen better, Levin?\u000a Because it was fun.\u000a Because it was fun? Okay. And what made it fun?\u000a She was acting like, the way she was acting\u000a The way she was acting? Okay.

Alright, anybody else?\u000a What were some other goal that you guys created? Sit up and join the circle please. Alright, let's see. Someone I haven't heard from yet. Isabelle, what was one of your goals?\u000a One of my goals was to stop making really distracting movements because I was like twisting it and twirling it and I was really nervous.\u000a Alright so that was the first time you did your presentation, you felt you were doing too many movements.\u000a Yeah.\u000a And so your goal was to cut down on that and why did you choose that as a goal?\u000a Really, when we watched my first video, we decided that,  she said that she was kind of watching that and she couldn't really have her attention stay on what I was saying.\u000a And did you agree with her?\u000a Mhmm.\u000a Okay, so what did you do with your second presentation?\u000a I really was concentr...\u000a

V Our is, like, Crown-- Crown Royal, and, like, it shows, like, a helmet, and, like, an ad for it, and it says, "He who wears the crown, " I think that's, like, if you wear the helmet, you will seem cool.\u000a Mm-hmm, and the helmet is for what, do you think? Motorcycles or cars, kind of racing kind of stuff? And Crown Royal, tobacco or alcohol? Alcohol, and racing a car. Thoughts?\u000a Drinking and driving. Huh.\u000a Well, that's bad.\u000a But they appeal to your-- your, uh, love of racecars and motorcycles and cool stuff, but those two don't really mix, do they? Next group.\u000a Ours is tobacco, and it has a picture of a firefighter, and it says, A bit braver, so it's trying to hook you by you wanting to be braver, and trying tobacco.\u000a So the inference there would be that tobacco makes you braver? What do you think? Could it really work? If I chew tobacco? Am I gonna be able to fight a fire?\u000a No.\u000a But firefighting appeals to a lot of young children, right? That bravery, that toughness, that rugged fireman thing. It's like, if I do chewing tobacco, I'm a rugged fireman type. Um, what are my teeth gonna look like, though?\u000a  Yellow.\u000a Not gonna look like the rugged fireman type, am I? \u000a Fireman sounds like he smiles, is that what you said? All right, um, ladies?\u000a Um, ours was alcohol, and, um, they got our attention by, like, the grandma and the daughter playing patty-cake and telling stories about her.\u000a So grandma and daughter-- and granddaughter playing patty-cake, lovely little sunny porch, sponsored by... ?\u000a Budweiser.\u000a Oh, my.\u000a Oh, that's so popular.\u000a So drink? You're appealing to the family nature? And the message is, drink our drink.\u000a Yeah, it says that, like, all stories weren't about family, they also had some other stuff.\u000a Family and Budweiser.\u000a Yeah.\u000a No.\u000a Yeah, you're getting it now. All right. Ladies?\u000a Um, ours is, um--\u000a There's isn't really an ad. There's is a display at a grocery store.\u000a Yeah, like, there is, um, a whole bunch of, like, alcohol in the background, and up closer, there's tobacco, and then there's a bunch a candy bars that should appeal to the little kids.\u000a Right next to the... ?\u000a The tobacco.\u000a Tobacco, okay. Candy bars.\u000a Like right there, and then, um, also you have pretty much the candy.\u000a Alcohol behind the booth, tobacco right up front, and candy bars right at hand level.\u000a Kids would probably think that tobacco's candy.\u000a They might.\u000a Or as good as candy.\u000a Does tobacco come in flavors like candy does?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a No.\u000a Yes, it does.\u000a Oh.\u000a Mint, berry, apple.\u000a Ew, really?\u000a Really. Hey, I think I missed a group. Did I miss a group? This one up front? Nope. Did I get you guys already? Did you guys share? Oh, you did share, just with me. Share with the rest of the group. It's\u000a Ours is alcohol and, like, if you're a rockstar, you'll drink, like, if you drink this, then you will become a rockstar.\u000a What hook did they use?\u000a The girls in bikinis.\u000a So how many guys are in that picture?\u000a One.\u000a One guy, and he's the one who's drinking the alcohol, and... ?\u000a Fifteen girls.\u000a Fifteen girls in bikinis. So if-- the message is, if you drink this... ?\u000a You'll get hot girls.\u000a You'll get hot girls, yeah. \u000a All right, you've had a chance to let-- Oh, sorry. Eyes. Ears. Mouth. Thanks. You've had a chance to look at these ads. Um, you've got a chance to see how they're trying to hook you in. You're knowing that the messages that they're sending are slightly warped. It's their trick to pull you in, but it's your job to think and process through using your critical thinking skills. Weigh it out. Consider, but then choose something else that's healthier. So we've looked at negative influences. It's time to talk about positive influences in your life, things that can help you say no to all of that, no matter how appealing it is, no matter how many girls in bikinis show up. Leave your cards right where they are in the center. It's time to take a look at the charts that are around the room. There are five of them. These are activities you can do instead of things like using drugs, alcohol, tobacco, like a social activity, um, something you can do with someone else. Ideas?\u000a Have a sleepover.\u000a Sleepover, good. All right, so in just a few minutes, we're gonna be rotating around the charts with different groupings. We're gonna be writing down our ideas of other positive things instead of this. Can anyone name one physical activity, something you can do that would be instead of using drugs, a positive thing? Football? Yeah. Did you want to share too? Go ahead.\u000a Um, riding your bike around the block.\u000a Good. You're on the right track, guys. Keep those ideas in your head. When you get to the chart, you'll have to write it down. What's something you can do with your brain, a mental activity that would be positive?\u000a Chess.\u000a Chess.\u000a I like chess.\u000a Math. Not for everybody, I understand. Um, this chart over here says "Emotional." What's something you can do, um, that can make your emotions feel better, your passions, or whatever? How can you support yourself emotionally, so you can say no to this?\u000a Trying to think happy.\u000a Yep. Positive thoughts.\u000a Watching emotional movies.\u000a Definitely gets your mind off those. I know you got great ideas, and I'm gonna be willing to see those on those papers in just a few minutes, so save them in your head.\u000a Okay.\u000a The last one is spiritual. Spiritual. Somehow you can nurture your spirit, so you have the ability to say no to negative influences.\u000a Go to church.\u000a Church. All right. Save it. You'll get a chance. Time to look at your pencils again. Leave your papers right where they are, okay? Face-up. This time, we're gonna go by color, and you might notice that there are markers at each station, for the right color. So when you get to the station, if you are-- patience. I promise I'll explain it. No worries. When you get to your station, we're gonna start with your bag of colors. You will take your bag of colors and your marker, and you will only use your color marker. So if you are a green guy, you would grab a green marker and you will be writing at this station first. You'll write down however many ideas you want. You'll talk it out with your group. You might notice, Mitchell, that I also put group work, uh, reminders up here, about how to work with others in your group. One, everybody has the right to speak, so make sure you give everybody a chance to talk it out if they need to, and to write it down, the topic. Don't interrupt. Give everybody a chance to share their side. Two, everybody has the right to be respected. We're not looking for put downs. We're looking for ones that can encourage us, positive things, so when you're getting ready to write positive things, speak positively to each other as well. And three, everyone has to agree to work together to solve a conflict. So if you're having a difficulty in your group, talk it out. Work together to solve that problem. If it's not working, and you can't solve the problem, who can you turn to for help?\u000a You?\u000a Me. And others in your group. So if you're a green person, you're gonna get one green marker, and there are multiple in here, in case your marker doesn't work. Get a different one. Write down whatever ideas you want. When you hear me say, "Switch," or, "Rotate," you move to the next chart around like the face of a clock. Take your marker with you. So there'll be multiple colors on here. You'll get a chance to write on every one. Yes?\u000a How does this work? Are you supposed to write it down like a list?\u000a You can write all over that paper. Yeah. Anywhere, as long as we're on the front. Everywhere, all over that paper, so you can all be on there at the same time as you want, you can take turns, you can arrange however you and your group want to. You each can have a marker, though. There's plenty of them for everyone. Yellow's are over here at "Emotional," um, I believe blue's are "Social," purple's are "Physical," and oranges are "Mental." Questions before we begin? Think about something to do besides. You'll have approximately 30 seconds to a minute, so listen for me to say, "Switch." Keep writing until I say it. Go! \u000a Here. How about we take this and put it on the floor. Does that work better? I know, it's going everywhere, isn't it? Here you go. You guys want to take that one down, too, put it on the floor, so it's a little easier to write on?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Good.\u000a I know, isn't it cool?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So I see you got chess on there. Anyone think of some other ones? Other mental, ways to use your brain, things you can think about it? \u000a Think of school kind of activities, things related to learning, using the brain. Spelling. You can practice your spelling. You can do your math. I think you guys are in right place. You have a lot of good ideas. Tell me your favorite one so far. \u000a Give him a spot.\u000a Good.\u000a How do you spell "baseball"? \u000a Oh, online. The Playstation, yeah, that is definitely a social event.\u000a I've got XBox Live.\u000a So social means involving what? Talking to other people, human beings, a relationship with them? All right. Ready in 10, nine, finish what you're writing, eight, seven, six, taking your marker with you in five...\u000a Oh, our marker?\u000a Four. Yep. Your writing in your color. Three, two, one, rotate. \u000a Spiritual. All things that are spiritual. What does that really mean?\u000a Your spirit?\u000a Your spirit, yeah. It could be feelings. I think we did emotions, though, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So this one would be more nurturing your soul, yourself.\u000a We've got meditation.\u000a We've got mediation, right.\u000a Yoga!\u000a Oh, yeah! Why don't you write that one down?\u000a How do you spell "yoga"?\u000a Yes, perfect. The Bible, poems. How much do you connect with your spirit or your soul? Any other resources or people? Pastor from a church. Friends you know from the church, or wherever you attend services. Who else besides a pastor can lead, um, a group?\u000a You can pray.\u000a Pray, good. You guys are on the right track. Emotional support. Where can we find emotional support? Family, friends, good. Who are some other resources for emotional support? Culture? How can we nurture your own good feelings? What do you do to feel better?\u000a Cuddle your pets.\u000a Cuddle your pets. You know that one's my favorite, too.\u000a It's okay, you don't have to spell things. All right, capping markers. Ready to move? 10, nine, eight, seven, six, ready gentlemen in five, taking your marker in four, three, two, one. Rotate. \u000a

V Scientist number two? I want to know what your question is, what is your variable that you're isolating, and what are you measuring? You guys ready? Okay, so, table two? Or table one?\u000a Our central question is how does different types of oil stains clothes, even after they've been rinsed. And our independent variable is going through the different oils that we used, and the dependent variable is how they changed from before, when we first stained them to after when we rinsed them.\u000a Cool, and you may be able to use the light probe to determine the intensity of that stain. Tomorrow--\u000a We also were planning on taking pictures from before and after, so we could like, compare those.\u000a So, you may want to do a scale, like Marley did with the intensity of her hair dye, as well, okay? But get it set up today, make it really controlled with all your measurements, and just change the type of oil. Alright, scientists, do you have any?\u000a Our experiment is we're going to mix oil and water and then try and separate the oil using positive and negative charges.\u000a Okay, using positively and negatively charged particles to separate oil from water? I don't know, I read your document, I don't know what the positively-charged particles you are, but did you work it out? Okay, so what's your question then?\u000a Our question is does charged particles affect the oil scum?\u000a Okay, does charged particles affect the shape of oil balls, them coming together, scum balls? Okay, good. Table three, what's your question?\u000a Um, how long does it take to make scum on the surface of the water, like, using what we're going to use, mainly olive oil and toilet paper.\u000a Okay.\u000a Perfect.\u000a And testing, the independent variable is testing how long we're going to stir. How long it takes to make scum, and then our dependent variable, we're going to take the observations of time.\u000a Okay, so the question is, how long does it take to form scum balls? Independent variable is the stir time, and the dependent variable is the...\u000a How long it takes.\u000a How long it takes to do it?\u000a Uh-huh.\u000a What are you going to measure, though?\u000a We're going to actually try to measure the surface area of the .\u000a Cool, so you're going to say how much is covered by scum at that point in time? Okay, that should be pretty easy to do with a camera shot. Okay, table four, what's your question?\u000a How does temperature affect the oil and water?\u000a How does temperature affect the oil and water? Awesome.\u000a And we're trying to figure out how it will separate.\u000a How can you separate it? What are you changing in the experiment?\u000a We're changing, we're going to use regular temperature and put it on a Bunsen burner and put it in the freezer.\u000a Cool, and you're more than welcome to use the freezer in the back. Good idea. Alright, table five, what's your question?\u000a Does heat affect the scum ball?\u000a Does heat affect the scum ball?\u000a And our independent's going to be amount of scum and the amount of water, and the dependent's going to be heat .\u000a Okay, so your independent, now you said heat and then you said the amount of water in whatever, so your independent is really going to be temperature. So, I feel like you have two independent variables. Why don't you just spend a minute and talking about which one you want to isolate. Is it the amount of water and the amount of scum? Or is it temperature? Okay?\u000a We were going to change the temperature.\u000a Then keep the amount of water and the scum constant. Because you can't do different amounts of water and scum and different temperatures. It means you're testing for two different things. While you could do that, it's two experiments and we don't have time today. So, just one experiment. Alright, table six?\u000a So, our central question is, is it possible to create scum balls in different shapes?\u000a Okay.\u000a And our independent variable was the amount of oil. And the dependent was the shape.\u000a Okay, so is it possible to make scum balls of different shapes? Independent variable is the amount of oil or scum, dependent variable is the shapes. While I'm over here, I just want to draw your attention to the back of the room. That is the waste beaker, which has scum on top of it right now. It's every kind of oil that Copper used yesterday. So if you want pre-made scum, I encourage you to use Copper's waste from yesterday. So, the bottom portion of it is a lot of soap and soap water. But the top portion of it is just that less dense, oily scum, okay? Alright, table seven, what's your question?\u000a It's can we filter out oil from the water using the gravel filter?\u000a Okay.\u000a So, we're trying two different types of oil and we're going to put it through a bunch of gravel in the container.\u000a Okay, and you may need to use two of the same identical filters, so just make sure you're really consistent with your measurements between those two filters. Good. Alright, I'm excited about their project because Copper had one group that did a filter yesterday and their results were very interesting. So, check back in with this group later on if you want to see what's going on with the filters. And table eight, what's your central question?\u000a Does oil collect some of the things in the surrounding body of water?\u000a Does oil collect the most what?\u000a Does oil collect the most of each thing?\u000a Oh, the most of each thing in the surrounding body of water? Okay, so you're going to look and see what it attracts? And what are some of the materials you're going to use?\u000a Dirt, sand, and pebbles.\u000a Dirt, sand, and pebbles, awesome. So, your independent variable is type of material that it would possibly attract. How are you going to measure those results?\u000a Mass.\u000a Mass? Okay, cool. You may want to work on a microscope slide just so you can have a little bit of an easier time measuring the mass. If you get too big, it won't measure on our balances. Which brings me to my next topic, which is safety talk. Conservation of materials. \u000a  Did you guys get a lecture yet?\u000a  No, because Sam is too busy with her.\u000a  Why don't you go over there and see what they're doing. Go, talk to her. Thank you. Alright, lady scientists. What's going on?\u000a We're like, I thought that we didn't need to do the middle one because yesterday we didn't have enough time, so we just did the small amount and then the larger...\u000a  Amount? Okay.\u000a  Now that we did the middle speed, we're actually seeing a lot different stuff, because the balls are actually coming together. That underneath, and we noticed also under here that everything settled to the bottom except the dirt and oil that reached to the top.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  And this is thicker than that one.\u000a  Okay, let me get another group over here because they're also trying to form a scum ball, and I'd like them to see your results. Terrence and Catherine and Maddy, can you guys pause and come and check out this group's experiment?\u000a  I don't see scum. It makes me mad.\u000a  Ooh, this is so cool.\u000a  Why does it look like that? I want it to look like that.\u000a  Come on over. These guys are also doing an experiment on scum balls. Can you guys talk about what's your independent variable? What are you changing?\u000a  We're just changing the different speeds.\u000a  Okay, and Yasmine, what were some of the things you added that were controlled within all three?\u000a  The dirt, oil, and the water.\u000a  Okay, and they used the black potting soil dirt. Is it the peat moss? In the plastic bag? That's peat moss.  Okay, good. And Taylor, it looks like you have some cloudy stuff in the bottom, what's that? Don't know? Can you guys fill her in?\u000a  Toilet paper.\u000a  Toilet paper, which makes sense because there's a lot of toilet paper over there. Okay, and so far, your results have been, they've just done the high speed and the low speed, right? And they're like, oh it's the same, nothing happened, nothing happened, right? They came back today, and this is the medium speed, and what's going on?\u000a  A lot of dirt, balls are actually coming down and forming together. Because they were all little pieces of dirt, and now they're making big globs of dirt. And that's weird.\u000a  So, does time, sitting overnight, have anything to do with it?\u000a  That's what we talked about with these two. Actually this one, because, and this one too, because we didn't see a lot of carbon bubbles in the first one. And then this one, I just noticed that it's actually the toilet paper is on the bottom and actually attached to the bottom layer of the oil.\u000a  Okay, are the highs and the lows working, the speeds, yet? Have you tried to re-run the highs and the lows today?\u000a No.\u000a  Re-run the highs and lows, you have a good seven, six minutes. See if they start to form clump balls. Not sure if you can use this one.\u000a  Can I go get a funnel?\u000a  Sure. There's one on the table. I am not sure if your choice of particles simply is inhibiting the formation of the scum balls or not. If you want to add another part to your experiment to make it more controlled, maybe you could add some toilet paper and see if that adds anything, or you could leave it how it is. It's your choice. Got about seven minutes, okay?\u000a  Thank you.\u000a  Yes, cool. Hey, you guys have some diesel fuel on your table? Any information, research, observations that could be made about the shapes of the molecules would be awesome. The three of you all together. Alright, so...\u000a  We got 97, no, 47, 94 for all of them.\u000a  Okay, let me put the camera on you four. Ready? Let's talk about it. Is that okay?\u000a Okay, so you isolated your variable, different types of oil. You made everything the same, same size, same amount of water, same amount of soap, time, soaking, everything was super-controlled, right? Okay, and then you just did a light prep on all of them and the look was the same across the board.\u000a Yeah, it was 47, 94, like it jumped between them two numbers, constantly. None of them, like...\u000a Consistent, so it was consistent. Alright, so any initial conclusions? Yes.\u000a I said that since all the things were like a darker color, and the oils were kind of close, I guess, in like, how they felt and what color they were, I guess that maybe if we used a white shirt, maybe there would've been a difference because it would've soiled it more.\u000a Do you feel like there is still oil in this fabric?\u000a Yes.\u000a Yes, okay, alright. Let me hear your conclusions, and then I'm going to--\u000a This one that had water on it is different-looking than this one, like the material looks more like--\u000a Like dry or something, right? So, there's some qualitative difference. I know that this one needs to be flipped over. Because then it's the same side of the fabric. Okay, so water--\u000a That one's whiter.\u000a Lighter, okay, so you feel like these are a little bit darker looking. And your control?\u000a This one is darker.\u000a Your control was the same as all of them? The 47, 94.  Okay. And you? Any conclusions yet?\u000a Um, I don't know. I kind of think the sand thing is sand because I know the one we put on the paper, like it went all the way down to 40-something, so maybe the fabric was too dark to the point where it was .\u000a Okay, and Lauren, what was your central question?\u000a My central question?\u000a The central question of your experiment.\u000a Oh, it was to see after we washed it how much of it was still there.\u000a How much of it was still there? Okay, or if it would affect the fabrics differently?  Okay, but your light probe is saying, no they're all the same, so maybe your eyes are off or maybe the probe is a little bit off or whatever.\u000a Should I take that as data?\u000a I think you should take it as data, yeah. And it's okay, you addressed your question, which was, how does oil affect it different among shirts? In your case, with the soap, maybe not at all differently. I'd like you to try one more thing involving paper towels. And what you're going to do, is you're going to see, you're going to press down as hard as you can with a paper towel and see if there's any oil that's absorbed on the paper towels, okay? So, that can be one other way to take data. To see if there's still any oil still stuck in the shirts.\u000a Okay.\u000a Okay? Goggles on. Goggles on! Goggles on!\u000a  What's the highest temperature we could put it at?\u000a  Are you guys boiling?\u000a  You can put it all the way up, you just have to be really cautious. Get your Hot Hands out, the big glove. Alright, Heather's group, I'm coming over to you guys. Ready? Okay, what's going on over here?\u000a  We put 10 millileters of motor oil in 150 mls of water and we added five grams of salt.\u000a Okay, ooh. Salt, when I was a waitress, we used to put salt on our oil stains to get the oil out.\u000a Maybe you could put a second... Wait, that's kind of like clay. I was going to say flour, because that's what we do if I spill.\u000a What do you notice?\u000a It's starting to kind of clump.\u000a When we had the clay, it was really, really clumpy, but then it...\u000a It, the, uh...\u000a Yeah, like the clay just clumped. And then we had to get before and that didn't really make a difference, it just sat at the bottom.\u000a My hands are sticky.\u000a Oh, thank you. While you're here, do you remember the charge of the particles of clay? Positive or negative?\u000a Negative.\u000a Okay, so, negatively-charged particles, and now you've added sodium chloride, which dissolves in water. You've got an A plus, positive, CL minus negative. And you're clearly getting a scum ball. No? What happens when you turn it off?\u000a It just all settles at the top.\u000a When we put clay in there for the first time, it was all little clay balls that slowly rose to the top. But nothing of the magnitude...\u000a So, that motion really helps it to stay together.\u000a Yeah, that's what we did. We put it at 500 RPMs first, and then we dialed it back down to 100.\u000a Let's apply this to the water treatment plant. Was there motion at the water treatment plant?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Was there clay in the water?\u000a Probably.\u000a From where?\u000a From the sediment on the bottom of the Schuylkill.\u000a From the sediment on the river? Now remember, the stuff that's going in the water treatment plant is coming directly from the home, so it hasn't had a chance to go in the Schuylkill River yet.\u000a Okay.\u000a Would there be any clay in the homes?\u000a Not in the homes, no.\u000a Not in the homes? Not in anything flushed down the toilet?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So, yeah, there could be some, like, clay-like sediment, sand particles going through. Or at the very least, we could say that there's probably some negatively-charged particles going through, some kind of silicates.\u000a  Shall we throw away the fabric?\u000a Sure.\u000a Who knows what's in feces, right? Alright so, what I think is cool about your experiment is the motion is really important in getting those scum balls to form. Have you talked about CeCe's experiment yet?\u000a  No.\u000a Go ahead and give that a whirl because they actually put peat moss in theirs, and they started to get scum balls to form on medium speed. Also, Matt, Ian's, sorry, Catherine's station is using sand, specifically, and I forget what the other material is. It looks like peat moss, and they're having no success. So, go ahead and do a little quick walk-around. And clean up.\u000a Motion.\u000a Can you let them, give them a 10 second overview?\u000a Yeah.\u000a And then go? Taylor, pull it together, you'll be okay. You're good? Okay. \u000a  Did you get any scum?\u000a No we didn't, we just got into lumps. The fastest way we got a layer, and then everything, the soil settled on the bottom. And then for the middle speed, it actually formed big clumps of balls with the oil mixed in. \u000a  Clean up, clean up. \u000a

V You're going to test and be coming up here for materials. Okay, go.\u000a You just follow the lines.\u000a If, no, if the lines, if red lines are drawn on a white piece of paper, the termites will follow the lines.\u000a We should draw, like a bunch of different circles and different colors and see which one they follow.\u000a  And we'll make it like this.\u000a Well, it's not going to be on a circle.\u000a  It can be like this and see if they'll follow that circle.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Would that be a good, may I bother you with this?\u000a  I'm just covering them up.\u000a  What are you saying?\u000a  Yeah, well beside this one. If termites... we'll place on a red piece, on a white piece of paper with a red circle and red lines, then the termites will follow the lines, in the circle.\u000a Okay, so you're going to use the color red line again. What color paper would you use?\u000a White.\u000a White paper?\u000a Yeah.\u000a And I think since we've already used colored paper, I think that's a result of that.\u000a Well, again you could do yours and yours and tie them together. Use different colored papers, so what's the point of your test?\u000a That depending on the colored paper we'll determine what the termites sight can do.\u000a I would think it's the color of the line because that's what they're following.\u000a So, you think they're following the color of the line?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Yeah, but when they went to the end of the white paper, they went to the black and they came right back.\u000a  Well, no, that's because they knew what it was, that's because I, like, kept hitting them back.\u000a  Okay, so you're kind of going along with the idea of color. How could you prove that color was...\u000a That color effects their...\u000a  You draw a bunch of different circles, draw a bunch of circles about the exact same size, but of different colors and see which one they go to?\u000a I like that.\u000a Nice, okay.\u000a On a white piece of paper?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Again I've got colored paper. The more tests you do, the more accurate your results would be.\u000a All right, so let's do the same test but on two different types of paper. So, if termites are placed on a white piece of paper...\u000a  Put that on top of it just so we block some of the light out. No, that down. Good, and there you go. So, what were we thinking about testing?\u000a Um, putting tables in line using different color.\u000a And to see if, we're not going to finish the circle and see if they follow it around.\u000a  Oh, very nice.\u000a Yeah, because we drew a line leading back to the thing and they followed it down.\u000a  They followed it down...\u000a  Tricky, okay.\u000a  They went, it's true.\u000a  So they didn't follow this part?\u000a  Yeah, because it curves.\u000a  No, because they...\u000a  We drew the circle.\u000a  They go, like, then they curve and go down.\u000a  And they came here and went back up. They all followed.\u000a  Hmm, interesting. Thank you, four. You've got about two more, about a minute and a half actually. What are we thinking? I'm going to go ahead and cover these up.\u000a We were planning on doing, um, like, we think they're attracted to the ink and I'm going to test it with like a marker, a pen, and a crayon.\u000a  Okay.\u000a To see if, like, if they follow the ink better than the other ones.\u000a Nice, would you use the same color of ink?\u000a Yeah, because it would be the control.\u000a  There you go, very nice? Um, what color paper are you going to use?\u000a Should we use regular?\u000a White.\u000a I would say white yeah.\u000a All right, good. Okay, sounds good. Where are your termites? Stop playing with them and we're going to actually cover them to kind of get the light out. What were you guys thinking about testing?\u000a Mainly, if they are going to follow the red line, then they must be attracted to red.\u000a  They must be attracted to what?\u000a  Red.\u000a  Red? Okay, so how could you test that they are just attracted to red?\u000a We're going to make two large circles.\u000a  Two large circles...\u000a  And some other lines.\u000a  And some other lines...\u000a But, what are you testing again?\u000a If they go to the red line then they must be attracted to red.\u000a Okay, so you're talking about the color red. Um, would you use, so you tell me what you're going to set up. I'm trying to follow.\u000a  Probably just a black one and a red one.\u000a Lines or circles?\u000a  Circles.\u000a Circles? Okay, all right.\u000a Yeah, basically just for fun.\u000a  Okay, okay, just for fun, all right. Um, you should be collecting materials. If pens and things aren't working, let me know.\u000a \u000a  Dude, get the line.\u000a  What happened to your situations?\u000a Well we put tape over this and now it doesn't follow it over here.\u000a  I think they like the color red.\u000a  None of them are following any of these lines.\u000a  How could you continue to test that they like the color red?\u000a  Put more red over here?\u000a  I mean, we also put the tape there and it doesn't like the tape. It gets confused.\u000a  And we have the red paper and it didn't follow the black lines.\u000a  Or the pencil.\u000a  Yeah, that's what I mean.\u000a  None of them here are even doing anything.\u000a  They get tired and just start standing there twitching.\u000a  Do you need some new ones? No, there are still pretty lively.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So, what are some of the conclusions that you're thinking? Oh, Terrance, be sweet.\u000a  Ah, be sweet.\u000a  Ah, white on red.\u000a  They only like that. Also they only follow that type of pen. They don't follow any other type of pen or pencil. Um, they don't necessarily have an affiliation to red.\u000a  Okay, how do you know that?\u000a 'Cause they walked off the red paper?\u000a  Okay, they walked off the red paper? So, you threw that one out. How could you continue to say that they like that particular pen, and not having to do red?\u000a  We tried black pen.\u000a  We haven't tried another color on white yet.\u000a  See look, it stopped at the tape.\u000a  It's confused at the tape.\u000a  No, Neal, what I asked you is that a pen or a marker? It's a pen.\u000a  It's a pen.\u000a  Oh, he's following the other...\u000a  We drew it on the other side...\u000a  We drew a circle on the other side.\u000a  It looked like he was following it.\u000a  Is it something inside of them?\u000a  No.\u000a  Like, what the ink's made out of?\u000a  How could you test that?\u000a  Using the red pen on this?\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Taking two different pens...\u000a  Go grab some more. That's a good idea.\u000a Red color pen, red color pencil.\u000a You killed the ant...\u000a  Gentlemen, be nice to your termites.\u000a  Oh, oh, wait... wait?\u000a  Here Neal, let's get...\u000a  All right, group, here's a red pen, colored pencil.\u000a  Oh, look! That one's alive!\u000a  Okay, now then, so what are you saying is going on?\u000a They're still following the red one. Yeah, they're still following the red pen. So, it's not necessarily an affiliation to the color red.\u000a  So, it is something inside the ink.\u000a  So, how can you test if it's something inside the ink?\u000a I just got the other colored pencil.\u000a  Take another red pen.\u000a  Go grab some.\u000a  It's right there.\u000a  That's a pencil.\u000a  It's the color red, look.\u000a  Stick with the, no, you just threw out the idea that it's red. Stick with the color... stick with the pen idea.\u000a  We need a pen like this.\u000a  No, I think we have the exact same pen.\u000a  No, no, the blue one like this.\u000a  They have a blue one like that?\u000a  Go see, there's blue pens up there.\u000a  Hey, can we borrow a red pen? I meant blue, you know what I meant.\u000a  Bam, it's a different type of pen.\u000a  It's all right.\u000a  Different type of pen, but it's blue now.\u000a  Did you get a blue one?\u000a  No, I just got red ones. I got bundles. \u000a  Nice.\u000a  Now they're going to follow it.\u000a  Now, I thought we were going to get away from the red idea and go with the pen.\u000a  I think it's that pen.\u000a  I've got the same pen.\u000a  They're still the red. I think they are.\u000a  Okay, try that one.\u000a  There's a hole there, by the way. If you press through it, it will break.\u000a  Go.\u000a  Are you going to make it intercept the line?\u000a  Yeah I'm going to.\u000a  Oh, look, he's following the little one.\u000a  Maybe it likes circles.\u000a  Wait, wait.\u000a  I still think it's something inside the ink.\u000a  Draw a square. See if it follows a square.\u000a  So, that would be able, you would be able to throw out your idea that it likes circles if you drew the square. So draw a square, see what happens.\u000a  Yeah, draw a square.\u000a  I've got another black pen. I have all these pens.\u000a \u000a  Why not draw the square inside of there?\u000a  Inscribe the square in the circle. Terms...terminology.\u000a  You're a professor now.\u000a  Oh, it's following it!\u000a  It is the pen.\u000a  Curves are easier.\u000a  It didn't know where the line was.\u000a  Okay, five, four.\u000a  Um, we drew different lines in the different types of pens, markers, colored pencils.\u000a  Did you do it all on the same page or on different pages?\u000a On different colored pages.\u000a  Why would you do it on different colored pages?\u000a  Ah, to make sure the tests varied?\u000a  Okay, did you use the same color of ink on each page? Describe to me your experiment web. The whole group can chime in too.\u000a  Um, like we drew, like a black circle on a black sheet of paper.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  To see if they could only like...\u000a  Please don't be rude.\u000a  Black circle on a black sheet of paper. Keep going, what else?\u000a  And that didn't work. They could not see it or follow it or anything so we decided to go with an experiment that Christian came up with, that take a white piece of paper and we drew, like,  every kind of color their was all at once and they seemed to only the follow the blue or red circles. None of the other colors.\u000a What were the blue and the red circles drawn with?\u000a  I believe different types of stuff. Mainly pen though.\u000a And this was all on one sheet of paper?\u000a  Well, we tried it on different sheets too.\u000a Okay.\u000a  That's what started us off.\u000a Okay. Um, did you have it all on one sheet at first?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, what did you realize was wrong with that?\u000a They were pretty much getting confused.\u000a As in we're going to have issues with what? Maintaining?\u000a  A control?\u000a A control, good. Only one independent variable, nice. Um, Nick's group, how did you go through the indentation?\u000a We drew several circles using each of the utensils and then I think we placed the termites in the middle and they all sort of, if they weren't in the middle, sort of eating off of the wood or, like, just exploring around, they were following the pen.\u000a Okay, um, your indentation line, did you draw that with just pens, different types of pens, did you draw it with markers, did you draw it with a paper clip?\u000a We just used the same color but we used different things. Like we used pens, Vis-A-Vis, colored pencils, stuff like that.\u000a  Okay, and what was your conclusion with that?\u000a They followed the pen because we thought it was the one that had the most distinct indentation.\u000a  Because they came, the termites, into that line, because we saw them go up to the edge and because they would feel there is a drop, and I figured oh, well they must be blind because they can't see that there's a drop there.\u000a  Interesting point. Why might you have used a paper clip as well to create the indentation, instead of a pen?\u000a Because it wouldn't have shown a color, but it would have still left the same indentation as a pen.\u000a Okay, so any components within that pen, color, chemicals, type of pen, whatever, if you would have used the paper clip and then followed that indentation, you would have been able to do what? Pen verses paper clip.\u000a Pen would have looked, I think it would have looked...\u000a  The paper clip  would have looked deeper,\u000a but the thing is, like,  would it prove if you had it or not.\u000a  Had what or not?\u000a  If they followed the dent or not. Not just like, the color or the like, smell, or whatever.\u000a  Very good, very good. So, by using the paper clip to create the indentation, they would have been able to rule out any type of color from the pen that left the indent, maybe the scent from the pen, the chemical from the pen that left the indent. By doing the paper clip just by itself, we would have been able to say okay, that obviously doesn't leave any chemicals, it doesn't leave any color, and if they're following that indentation, we know that that's what they are drawn too. Okay? Carly, your group had an interesting set up.\u000a Um, we, well we kind of did two.\u000a  All right.\u000a But the first one, we have like a black piece of paper and we bordered it with, like, white pieces of paper and we drew a white circle in the black piece of paper to see if they would go away from the white to go to the darker paper. And that didn't really work, so we did the other one and, um, with, like, the different colors of circles on a white piece of paper, and they only went on the red pen one.\u000a  Okay, what could have been a variable in your experiment that you just described? As in something that might have thrown off the results?\u000a Paper? I don't know.\u000a  Well, notice in one of the experiments you used a what, to create the circle?\u000a The pen.\u000a  Okay, you used a pen and in the other experiment you used a what?\u000a Paper?\u000a  But you used a... Oh, white, yeah, you used a white colored pencil. So, by using a colored pen and then a white colored pencil, what are those two things now? Added on what?\u000a  Variables.\u000a  Added on variables. Okay, for one you're using pen and pencil, another you're using colors. So, how could you have made your experiment a little bit more definite that would of maybe ruled out some of the other variables? Gentlemen, calm down.\u000a We could have used colored pencils the whole time.\u000a Okay, could have used the same color colored pencil the whole time. Good. Um, what group haven't I talked to? Matthew, explain to us the set up of your group.\u000a Do you want to start?\u000a I don't know what to say.\u000a Oh, okay then we started off thinking that they followed the color and so we drew with a different type of pen and it did not follow it, so we decided maybe it's not color. So, we took a black pen, a big one. Um, we took a black pen,  and then two red pens of different type, and two blue pens of different type, and they only followed the specific type of pen red and blue. It was the BIC pens, so we decided there must be something in that, in the chemical structure of that ink that's, you know, similar to some sort of pheromone of some sort. Um, and the termites followed it.\u000a Okay, um, did you think of the pheromone thing yesterday?\u000a Yeah.\u000a After school.\u000a That was extracurricular.\u000a  All right so...\u000a But we figured out the BIC pens. We figured that out.\u000a Okay, good. Excellent set up there. Were there any variables that, when I was over there earlier you had different shapes with the different pens?\u000a You got this?\u000a Yeah, we were drawing with different shapes 'cause it followed the circle and then we were trying to get them back inside the thing. So, we drew a line pointing down there so they would follow it. And they did follow it but then we realized it might not be the shape, it might be in the pen or the color.\u000a  They don't really like sharp angles though. We drew a square and they got lost.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a They couldn't find the angle.\u000a  Okay, interesting. So, um, if any of you did do any sort of research , you were able to find that the pheromone that termites emit, and we learned that those were what? Pheromones?\u000a  Enzymes.\u000a Enzymes, not enzymes. What are pheromones having to do with? We just spent three days on it.\u000a  Animal behavior.\u000a Animal behavior, communication, their chemical signals. Okay, so we learned that termites emit these pheromones. We might have encountered this last time and that's the same thing why ants follow a specific trail. Um, when honeybees sense danger, they emit a warning pheromone that tells everybody in the hive to freak out, that danger's coming. But the pheromone that termite's emit to have them follow each other in the hole trails and all of that, the chemical in that mimics or the chemical in the pen, in Bic and PaperMate pens actually, mimics the chemical in the pheromones, which is why they followed certain pens.\u000a

V Tell them what you wrote. Describe your three pictures, and then they're going to share what they saw, and the three pictures they picked.\u000a \u000a The cat.\u000a I picked the roller coaster.\u000a Man.\u000a What did you get for what ?\u000a I only did two.\u000a \u000a I think the Earth .\u000a \u000a Y'all did the roller coaster?\u000a  Max, is that possible? Why not, what did you write?\u000a  There's no gravity.\u000a  So, in that picture he's weightless, but where is he?\u000a  In front of a building.\u000a  So, he's on a planet, right?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So, what should happen, if this was a video and we saw the next two seconds of that video?\u000a  He's falling?\u000a  He should fall, right? All right, write that down next to that picture.\u000a \u000a I don't mean to do that.\u000a  All right, so let's look at the roller coaster.\u000a He couldn't even fall like that because you got the gravity pushing down, so that's why why he wouldn't fall like that. And that's either like, strange stuff. But I don't think he could fall like that.\u000a Unless he... .\u000a He can't fall like that. That's impossible. Get his weight, and . Yeah, exactly, 'cause he can't do that. Yeah, 'cause you can see his shadow under that. And don't think he, I think he got like a hoop or something. So, like a little string or something.\u000a Or like, he fall?\u000a Yeah, 'cause he can't do that. They must have took that while he was. 'Cause that's impossible. Earth's gravity pulling him like that. Unless he in space or something.\u000a \u000a  All right, so why would he fall?\u000a Because the force of gravity pushing down.\u000a  So, why would he fall that way and not fall that way?\u000a The gravity would push him down, and not up, so . There's like, there's gravity on Earth, so like if you consider, like how Newton found the apple when it fell to the ground.\u000a  Okay, so you know there's something going on that's pulling you down. And you say, "What if you were on the "other side of the Earth?" Would it be pulling you up then? If you were on the other side? Or, would it still pull you down to the ground?\u000a It would still pull you down  to the ground.\u000a  All right, so on the planet, what can we say about gravity? Where is it trying to pull you?\u000a To the center.\u000a Ah, to the center, so it doesn't matter where you stand, it's not pulling you down, it's just trying to pull you where?\u000a To the center.\u000a To the center, okay. All right, one more minute for sharing. Make sure you have three pictures described on your T-chart. If you need to borrow an idea from your neighbor, do that now.\u000a  And you got the Solar System? Okay so, it says planets can move because of gravity. Where are they moving?\u000a \u000a   around the sun. And what has them go in a circle and not flying away? All right, who would like to share what they wrote with their group? Their favorite one, their favorite picture? All right, Arquel, which one was your favorite picture?\u000a  The roller coaster.\u000a Roller coaster, who picked roller coaster? All right, so let's all look at the roller coaster. And Arquel, tell us what your team wrote down and Sarah will add it to our list.\u000a  We had put that the gravity brings the speed to the... to the roller coaster. So, if you wanted to make the speed increase, you would want to bring your hill higher. So, therefore the... the speed will increase and it'll go faster.\u000a  All right, so Arquel says that gravity makes roller coasters go faster? So, if you want a faster roller coaster, you need to build a higher roller coaster. Did anybody write anything different for roller coaster? Carlos, what did you write?\u000a  Oh, the same thing, but the steepness of the hill when it's going down it increases its velocity, and it's more G's.\u000a  All right, so he says the steeper the hill, more velocity, more G's. What's a G? Let's have Carlos try first, then we can help him out if he needs help. What's a G? You said G.\u000a  Yeah. A G is a pull.\u000a Okay, so it's a pull. Adriana, you want to add to it?\u000a It's a force pushing against you.\u000a All right, pushing against you. Anybody else want to add to that? It's a pull, its a force, it's pushing against you. How do we get a G force? What do you think, Austin?\u000a  You have a push or pull, you have excess friction, air accelerates.\u000a Push or pull, excess friction. Arquel?\u000a All the forces together.\u000a All the forces put together on you? Okay. So, let's write "G force" down and put a question. 'Cause we're still not sure what that is, maybe we can get there. So, we're not sure quite what a G is. But we know it has something to do with gravity. All right, let's pick another picture. Who had a favorite picture that we haven't talked about that wasn't a roller coaster? What was your favorite picture, Greg?\u000a  The dude.\u000a The dude, who is the dude?\u000a \u000a He has a name. We know who that is. Who is that, Enrique?\u000a  Johnson.\u000a  It was Newton, right? What was Newton's first name? Not John.\u000a  Isaac?\u000a  Issac, there we go. Issac Newton, all right. And what does the dude say? Isaac Newton? What's he saying? What's his quote?\u000a  Not that dude, this one.\u000a Oh, the floating dude. Okay, the floating dude. He'd rather talk about the floating dude above Isaac Newton. Okay, so let's look at the guy floating in the middle of the air. He looks like he's planking. Is this a possible picture if you just saw the picture?\u000a  No.\u000a Greg, why do you say this is impossible? Because the Earth's gravitational pull, right?\u000a Okay, so he says the Earth's gravitational pull, what?\u000a Like, this wouldn't work because when you pull... .\u000a Okay, he should be being pulled down to the center of the Earth. Why do you say the center?\u000a 'Cause that's where the gravitational pull's coming from.\u000a 'Cause that's where all the gravity wants to take you and that's where all the gravity's coming from, I like that answer. Anybody want to add to it? Vanessa.\u000a  But if you have pressure against both forces, you could possibly stay up longer?\u000a Okay, so how could you get pressure to make you stay up longer? Chloe?\u000a  Force?\u000a  Where would that force come from?\u000a Your body?\u000a  So, how could he, if he's not touching the ground, make himself float? What's underneath you that you don't see?\u000a  Gravity?\u000a Well, we don't see gravity, but what's underneath him? It's around us right now.\u000a  Air?\u000a The air, right? So, let's think about the air. If we could make the air thicker, what would we also increase?\u000a  The gravity?\u000a  Not the gravity, we're trying  to go against the force of gravity.\u000a  The weight? The force against our weight. What's that called, let's think about a boat. Floating in the water.\u000a  Bouyance? Bouyant force, right? So, if you could increase the bouyant force of the air, and Vanessa said if you could make that strong enough, you should be able to float. Does anyone know a planet where there's more thick clouds than we have here? It's our neighbor.\u000a  Mars.\u000a He has clouds? Who has clouds, who has thick clouds? Jarissa?\u000a Venus?\u000a Venus. Yeah, is that what you were going to say? Venus has super thick clouds, right? And if we could go there, maybe there'd be enough air underneath you, that you could float in the air. If they was pushing enough bouyant force on your body, okay? All right, anymore for the floating guy? Did anybody write anything different for the guy who looked like he was floating in the air? I know that Karima and Anthony had a good answer. What did you guys write down Anthony?\u000a Put that... I put that the gravity will pull you to the center of the Earth, and it will like... Like it would...\u000a  It pulls you to the center of the Earth, and what did we decide about where you stand on Earth?\u000a Like on the other side?\u000a  So, what would happen if you went to the other side of the Earth? Would it still pull you the same way? Or is it going to pull you an opposite way?\u000a The same way.\u000a  The same way, where is it always going to pull you?\u000a Down.\u000a  Towards the center?\u000a  To the center, to the middle, okay? It doesn't matter what planet you stand on, doesn't matter where you are, it's trying to take you to the center of the object, okay? So, why do we get stuck to the Earth, and that the Earth's stuck to us in this picture?\u000a 'Cause the Earth's solid and it doesn't let us go out into the .\u000a Okay, so he said the Earth is solid. Are we solid?\u000a  Yes. Hmm, okay, so maybe it's not that we're solid, 'cause maybe there's something else going on. What do you think, Carlos?\u000a  The Earth has more mass than us.\u000a  The Earth has more mass than us. Jenny, what's mass?\u000a  Mass is, well, all of us then?\u000a  We all have it. How would you give a definition of mass, what is it about us?\u000a  The type of weight?\u000a  It's the type of weight. Okay, we're on the right track. Who wants to help her out? What's mass?\u000a  The amount of density?\u000a  Amount of density. Okay, we're getting better. Jarissa?\u000a The amount of space that it takes.\u000a  Well, what would that be, what's your space? Volume, okay? So, space is volume. We're still trying to figure out what's mass? We've heard some density words, we've heard volume words, what do you think, Ky?\u000a The amount of electrons?\u000a  Oh, we're getting closer. So, it's your electrons, your...?\u000a  Atoms?\u000a  Ah, your atoms. So, it's how many atoms you have inside your body. That's your mass. So, now someone else said weight, so let's go back to that. How do you get weight? So, you stand on the scale. How do you know your weight? What is going on? What do you think Hakeem?\u000a  Pounds?\u000a  We measure it in pounds? Okay, so how do me measure it? How do you get pounds? What's happening to your mass? What happens when you stand on the scale? What is it measuring?\u000a  Your weight.\u000a  Your weight. So, then how do we figure that out? What's going on? What's going on on a scale? Carlos.\u000a  The gravity is pushing you down?\u000a  Gravity is pushing you down. So, what happens to your weight, if you have more mass?\u000a  You're heavier?\u000a You're heavier. So, your weight, how would we give a description of weight now? We know mass is how many atoms you have. We know volume is how much space you take up. So, now what's weight? Carlos has kind of said it for us. How would we put it as a definition? It's the pull of what on your mass?\u000a  Gravity?\u000a Pull of gravity. So, let's look at the guy in the picture again. If this was going to be true, what would we have to say about his mass to be able to float? Would he be allowed to have a mass on Earth? Hakeem says "no," Vanessa says "yes." If you're going to float, and there's gravity, always trying to pull you down, in order to float, what do we have to do? With our mass? Decrease our mass, okay? So, let's think about if we go to another planet with our weight. Does your mass change if  you go to another planet?\u000a  Yes, no.\u000a Do all of a sudden, you have more atoms in you?\u000a  No.\u000a  Depending on the gravity.\u000a What did you say?\u000a  You have the same atoms, but your weight and mass changes.\u000a You said the same amount of atoms, so your weight and mass changes. But if you have the same amount of atoms, isn't your mass the same?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay, so what's the only thing that would change, Jarissa?\u000a  The gravity.\u000a The gravity, so then what would that change about your weight? Would it change, or would it stay the same?\u000a  It would change.\u000a  It will change. So, what can we say if we went to a smaller planet?\u000a  You'll become lighter.\u000a  You'll become lighter. Why?\u000a  Because it has less gravity.\u000a Has less gravity, so less pull. You weight less, okay? So, let's put "weightless" next to "G force" as another word we should look up. Ready? All right, so, what I want you to do now, using all your notes that we just took and what we just talked about, I want you to flip your paper over. And in the circle, I would like you to try with your partner, to write a definition for what you think gravity is. I'll give you one minute. You and your partner try to figure out what you think the definition of gravity is, and write that in your circle back.\u000a  Make sure you guys share that, okay?\u000a  A lot of weight, or... What's the other word of how many atoms you have? What's it pulling on? Very good, so it pulls on your mass. And think about where it's trying to pull. Oh, that's a good definition.\u000a  of gravity, try to write your definition on your paper. Make sure your neighbor also has a definition on their paper.\u000a  Pulls what? Pulls the...\u000a  Weight?\u000a  You almost said it.\u000a  Mass?\u000a  Mass.  Make sure you guys share that, okay? You guys done? Okay, so what is gravity? It's a force, so that means it's a what?\u000a  A...\u000a  A short pull? Gravity's pulling us, right? Okay, so what's, so what do you think, is it pushing or pulling?\u000a  Pushing.\u000a  Pulling.\u000a  Ooh, we have a disagreement. Better figure out which ones right.\u000a  Okay, so it's a pull. So, where is it trying to take you to?\u000a  And what is it trying to take about? Your... Your definition. All right, what are you having?\u000a I wrote that gravity is an invisible force that pushes or pulls you towards the center.\u000a  Okay, so the word I want you to make sure we say is "invisible." 'Cause we'll talk about that, okay? All right, so let's share our definitions. Who would like to share their definition first? All right, Ky.\u000a  We put gravity is a force that always brings you to the middle.\u000a  All right, Gravity is a force that always brings you to the middle. So Sarah, can you add that to the circle? Arquel, what did you guys write?\u000a  Gravity is a pulling force that brings you to the center of the Earth, and it wants to  the mass.\u000a  Okay, so you added "mass" to that. Okay, so it's pulling on mass. What do you want to add Angel?\u000a I want to add to Kyle's answer that it's invisible.\u000a  Invisible. So, let's think about what we learned about forces. If it's invisible, you can't see it. Is it touching you?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Or is it everywhere?\u000a  It's everywhere.\u000a Everywhere. So, is it a contact force, or a non-contact force?\u000a  Non-contact.\u000a Why do you say that, Israel?\u000a  Because it's not touching you.\u000a It's not touching you. So, even if you're floating in outer space, will gravity still be there?\u000a  Yes.\u000a What do you think, Carlos?\u000a  Yes. You say "yes." So, those astronauts, will they still feel some gravity? Even though they're out at the space station? What do you think, Angel?\u000a Outer space has some gravity, but greater than, that's why they wouldn't feel it.\u000a What do you think it depends on? We have mass so far. But the strength of gravity also depends on something else. We have mass, but what could it also depend on, Vanessa?\u000a  Force?\u000a Okay, gravity is a force. Angel was getting there, he was saying that it's still pulling on you, it's just not as strong.\u000a  The weight?\u000a That's mass. We talked about mass and weight. Trying to get the other thing that's going to control gravity.\u000a  How big the planet is?\u000a Okay, so that's mass. Let's think about the astronauts who are not as close to the Earth. Are they weightless? They have the same amount of mass, their mass didn't change. But they went farther away from the Earth. So, why are they weightless? Why do they float? What's the other factor going on with gravity? Moving away from the center of the Earth. So, what do we call that? Has to do with how the gravitational pull depends on... We have mass, and we're looking for the other factor we could change to change gravity. What do you guys think? If I'm really far away from Jarissa, am I able to grab her as much as if I was closer?\u000a  No.\u000a If I go real close to her, is it easier for me to pull on her?\u000a  Yes.\u000a But what happens if I go far away? I have the same mass, my mass doesn't change, can I reach her as easily now?\u000a  No.\u000a So, what's the other thing going on with gravity?\u000a  Distance?\u000a Distance. So, if you're far away from the Earth, can gravity pull on you as hard?\u000a  No.\u000a No. But the closer you get, the little bit stronger, little bit stronger. So, then why do we feel the pull of gravity here on Earth, but I don't feel the Sun?\u000a  We're closer to the Earth than we are the Sun. So, we're going to feel the Earth before we would feel the Sun. But now if we left the planet, we started going somewhere else, say I was going to Mars. What would happen the closer I got to Mars? Who would start pulling me now?\u000a  Mars.\u000a The Mars center of its planet would start to pull me. Okay? So let's look at the picture of the planets. Thinking about pulling to the center, why in the picture of the planets is the Sun in the middle of all the planets?\u000a  Because it's the biggest.\u000a  Oh, it's the biggest one.\u000a We got a couple of different answers, so let's share with our neighbor first. See if you know why the sun is in the center. You got 30 seconds.\u000a It's got the biggest mass.\u000a It got the biggest mass, and it's the biggest. So like, it got the most gravitational pull. That's why it's in the middle.\u000a \u000a  All right, Marco. Why do you think the Sun is in the center of our solar system?\u000a Because... I don't know.\u000a  You don't know. Okay, Javier, what do you think? You're his partner, what did you guys talk about? Based on what we just talked about, why would the Sun go in the center?\u000a It has more mass?\u000a  It has more mass. So, what does it also have more?\u000a  Gravity. So, he's always going to be in the middle, right? What if we had a bigger star come our way? Like what about a black hole? Say one of our neighbors blew up. One of our...\u000a

V Work of art in front of the class using the smart board.\u000a We have to--\u000a Continue working please.\u000a We have to finish the whole thing today?\u000a You should have enough time if y'all aren't drawing on the artwork that much. But y'all been working hard and a little bit of playing, but working pretty well. After you get finished with the analysis, go ahead and flip over and start on your interpretation. What you think is going on or what the artist is trying to portray in the work of art. All right, so y'all are on interpretation?\u000a Yeah.\u000a What do y'all think of the work of art? Kaitlin, what do you think of the work of art?\u000a Well, it makes us feel like calm.\u000a It made me feel calm.\u000a It made y'all feel calm?\u000a No, it made me feel calm.\u000a It made me feel calm.\u000a Okay. Now have any of y'all been out west?\u000a Huh?\u000a Out west like Colorado, Wyoming, places like that?\u000a Yeah. Yeah.\u000a Well, sometimes in the mountains, they have places where the snow has melted and there are actually small lakes or ponds up inside the mountains. So you could actually either be looking at a lake where you could drive up to or something that's hidden in the mountains. So if you're calm, that's a pretty good idea. All right, guys, what are y'all working on now.\u000a We're on judging the building. I keep working on one.\u000a Okay. Can you tell me what you have about interpretation?\u000a I think of this art as a rainy day. The sky is a dull gray.\u000a I like the bright colors on the doors.\u000a It's like a mixture of happiness and boredom. Since it looks like it's raining, the dark clouds at the top of the painting when it goes from white to dark.\u000a Like from light and it's going to dark, that's when you can tell it's about to rain.\u000a Okay, gotcha, gotcha. Sounds good.\u000a That, sir, is my interpretation.\u000a Okay, and with judgment, what are y'all think about the work of art right now?\u000a My judgment of the art is that it's kind of a boring day. It's slightly dull but you don't know what's about to happen.\u000a Sounds good so far. Keep working. Y'all doing all right over here?\u000a Yeah, we're doing...\u000a I wrote my opinion. Now he's gonna write his opinion.\u000a Yeah.\u000a And then Brody will write his opinion? Sounds great.\u000a All right. Y'all on interpretation. What y'all had? Oh, y'all are each doing interpretation?\u000a Yes, sir. We were going to do that for judgment and interpretation.\u000a Sounds great. And what are y'all looking at now for interpretation with the subway painting?\u000a We're doing what it makes you feel.\u000a Okay, what do you have so far?\u000a Well, he wrote most of them.\u000a Okay, so he can read it?\u000a Okay, actually it makes me feel like traveling...\u000a Okay.\u000a ...since they're on a train. And that's pretty much it.\u000a All right. Who would like to tell me what they are thinking of for interpretation on valley flowers?\u000a I don't know. I mean, it's a good painting but it's not really my favorite.\u000a Okay.\u000a It's not very exciting.\u000a So that would be for judgment? You don't find it exciting? Okay, kind of boring. What do you think of the work of art?\u000a I think it's a bit dull because there's not really any colors or anything like that, and it's got the same colors where each... Right here is green, and right here is orange, and blues back there.\u000a You know, if I was using my imagination, I would think of maybe The Incredibles in where the mole men came up at the end and were taking over the Earth. So these could be tunnel boring machines.\u000a,  Start using the principles of design, okay? So you look at the packet for the principles of design. With the principles of design, you gonna be telling me what you see in the work of art. So instead of shapes, you may be telling me, what's something you see in your work of art. You've got "Gold Is Where You Find It." What's one thing you see in the work of art?\u000a  Gold.\u000a  You see gold, what else do you see?\u000a  The miner.\u000a  Miner, and what is the miner doing?\u000a  Drilling.\u000a  Drilling, okay, so those would be all stuff that you see in the work of art. So go ahead and start on the second part with analysis, if you're ready to start on that. \u000a  Alright, are we doin' alright here?\u000a  Yeah, we don't get how was the work created.\u000a  Okay, you may have actually answered that when you were up here. If you look at the packet right here, and the title of the work of art is "The Sky Pond." read the rest for me? Who it was who created it?\u000a  Kauvar--\u000a  Kauvar--yeah, close enough.\u000a  Smith--\u000a  Smith.\u000a --Born: Cape--Ugh, this is hard.\u000a  If you can't pronounce it, just do the best you can.\u000a  Giradeau, Missouri-- Missouri, 1893. Died: Denver, Colorado, 1977. Oil on canvas.\u000a  Uh! What did you say?\u000a  Oil on canvas.\u000a  Is how it was created and it was about, this size right here, okay? So that tells you how the work of art was created. Later on, you're gonna look at why the work of art was created, and what purpose it served. \u000a  Yes?\u000a  What do I say, how--\u000a  I know what we do! It says, if they draw it in three-dimensional--\u000a  Okay.\u000a  And they take some kind of colored pencil, or painting, and then sketch it like you do, and then they go from dark to light.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  And, then they make the texture from, the sun is over here, and there's a little bit of shade because, this would be covering all this. There would be a shade right here. So it's over here, it would be lighting everything on this side of the tree,\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  and this side of the house, roof, and that side of the house.\u000a  And you've got, are these shapes back here? Or are those somethin' else?\u000a  These are shapes.\u000a  Okay, are shapes flat or three-dimensional?\u000a  Three-dimensional.\u000a  Shape forms are three-dimensional, alright?\u000a  Oh yeah.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So those are forms?\u000a  So those are forms, yeah. But you were right about everything, You were right about the sun, you were right about the texture, the shading, everything, that's really good. So you can tell a little about this on how you think the work was made, and also relate it to playing with your pen on your finger, and also oil on canvas. Continue working, please.  Alright, so y'all are on analysis now? And what work of art do y'all have? Y'all have got "Subway." Alright, so what are y'all lookin' at in the Subway for analysis so far?\u000a  It's something, asymmetrical balance.\u000a  It's asymmetrical balance?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  There are three types. You've got symmetrical balance, when everything is exactly the same, you've got asymmetrical balance when it's weighted the same. So there's the same amount of weight visually. It's not exactly the same. And then you've got radial symmetry, which is a project we did a little bit earlier. Okay? Good. \u000a  So, is it saying that shapes, especially right here, these shapes are more rounded versus straight and flat. 'Cause these are more 3-D than these. These kind of have shadows and are free. So, we were saying how that makes the consistence more complex than the simpleness of the, outside factors, I guess?\u000a  Yes, mm-hmm. Good! Keep going. Alright.\u000a  Would this be water?\u000a  That is possibly water right there. Yes it is. And what part are y'all on? Y'all are on the analysis right now? Okay. And y'all are lookin' at the "Valley Farms" by Rose Dickinson? Okay, cool. So what do y'all have so far for analysis?\u000a  Colors from the scene go together, it can show--\u000a  Could you speak a little louder? Sorry.\u000a  Colors from the scene go together. It can show, a straight web is going along the farm with the bridge in there. A small fire is going on, with smoke coming from the flames. Smoke is coming from the mountains.\u000a  Sounds good, keep going. Alright, let's check in over here. How are y'all doin'?\u000a  Good.\u000a  Okay, wow, y'all have got a lot for an analysis.  Alright, what else do you have? So y'all are about ready to start on analysis?\u000a  Yes, sir.\u000a  Okay, so let's look here. Now tell me how all the answers from the description you just made, are related to each other, i.e., how the effects were organized, complement one another, or create harmony or distress. This step can often be the most confusing, because it is very similar to the first, and can easily overlap. A good suggestion is think about all the principles of art: movement, rhythm, variety, portion, emphasis, and balance, and contrast work together, okay? So think about how they work together to create this work of art, and tell me everything you see in the work of art, but not by shape and colors. Alright.\u000a  The shapes and colors of the background create a texture that will--\u000a  What?\u000a  A texture--\u000a  What?\u000a  The--  The shapes and colors of the background, create a texture that will--\u000a  Like he is actually drilling near a cave.\u000a  Creative.\u000a  Now, would you say, these warm colors or cool colors?\u000a  Warm\u000a  Warm, way warm.\u000a  Warm? Now why would you say they're warm colors?\u000a  'Cause they're darker.\u000a  They're darker? Okay.\u000a  It shows that the colors of the background...\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Now something else. Does it look like he blends into the background?\u000a  No.\u000a  He doesn't?\u000a  Yeah, uh-huh.\u000a  Okay, so think about that too. If he stood out, he would look like he maybe didn't belong, but it kind of looks like he belongs there. I like what you said, keep working. I'll be back in a minute to check on you. Alright, Guys. Turn around. Alright, what are y'all workin' on now? Analysis?\u000a Analysis.\u000a  What do y'all have for analysis so far, Patrick?\u000a  I didn't get that. I got one for variety and balances.\u000a  Okay, so something is different from this picture. Can you just read to me what you have so far, please?\u000a  Something's different from this top picture, because the floor is green beneath the room, because it's different, because I thought, I thought the floor's just one color, so that's why it's different.\u000a  Okay, that's good, and it's also different from up here. You could say that there's a contrast. Let's look for the definition of contrast in here. Do you all know what the definition of contrast is, or what contrast is?\u000a  Two things are very different from--\u000a  I was on balance, I'm on balance now.\u000a  Okay, so contrast is what? One more time, I'm sorry.\u000a  Two things that are very different, and have a large contrast.\u000a  Okay, so would you say cool colors and warm colors have a strong contrast?\u000a  Yeah, because they're bright colors and they give out perspective.\u000a  What about the two Cs?\u000a  Okay, two C's, so? Keep going. Alright, what part are y'all on now? Analysis? And y'all have got "The Subway", okay? So, can you read to me what you have, or tell me something that you haven't added, but you were about to?\u000a  Jaymen's adding that.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  I wanna add, it has radial balance, because you can kinda see where the center print is, and then you can kind of see all these people, all these stuff.\u000a  Okay, now I have a question. Have y'all seen that there's a commercial on a few months ago?\u000a  It's a radio commercial!\u000a  Yeah!\u000a  The TV, where she's sitting in the train, and she's watching the TV, someone's reading the newspaper and she's watching the TV? And she steps out, and it looks like they may have gotten the idea, from that ad, from this work of art, 'cause there's lots of people on the train car, they're reading newspapers and she steps into the future, by actually reading her's on a Samsung Galaxy or something like that. So that'd be a good connection to popular culture, okay?\u000a  Hello, I was just \u000a  Which one we were talkin' about earlier? Okay, sounds good. What's up? Okay. Alright, what ya on? Okay, what added, or what  have y'all gotten to since I was last over here?\u000a  We see the ocean behind the mountains, green grass is covering the farmland, and the lines on the mountains are curved, not pointed. The mountains are curved.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  The houses are spread apart, the sky is a light green-blue.\u000a  Sounds good, and it sounds like y'all are just about finished with analysis, so are y'all gonna be moving on to interpretation next? Okay.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Active listening, right hand. Active listening, left hand. Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of people are having really great and meaningful discussions in the groups, but please remember that we are all doing different works of art, studying them, and we're also discussing them together. So that everybody's able to work without yelling across, can we take it down just a notch, a little bit, please? Keep it a little bit lower? I'm not telling you to whisper, and I'm not telling you to stop what you're doing, 'cause your doing a great job. Just let us take it down a notch, please. Keep working, please. Alright, how are y'all doin' over here?\u000a  We're doing really good.\u000a  Okay, what can you tell me about your analysis on this work of art?\u000a  It said that for the first question, well, the first thing, we said the artist Douglass Crockwell is using repetit-- well, is  repeating shapes and colors to create a visual image of the painting. And right now, we're writing, how classes are organized.\u000a  And how it's saying what we introduced for description.\u000a  Okay, now, with "Paper Workers", Now let's look at the workers. The workers, do they look like they stand out from the industry and from the industrial aspects of this work of art?\u000a  No.\u000a  They kind of look like they blend in. So could they actually be considered to be parts of the machinery?\u000a  Mhmm.\u000a  Okay, so that's something you may wanna think about when you're working on analysis, or when you switch over to interpretation in just a little bit. Can you go touch the keyboard to bring the Smart Board back on, please? Alright, what are y'all workin' on now?\u000a  I don't know.\u000a  You don't know, okay. You don't know what principles you've covered, or you don't know what aspect of the painting you're working on right now?\u000a  We're working on analysts, and so far we've covered how the miner and the vat ground relate to each other. We covered what colors they have and how they can relate. We're about to work on shapes. Shapes are in there.\u000a  So let's think about texture, some.\u000a  Yeah, we are.\u000a  Look at the definitions, okay. And let's look at... I wouldn't look at space or balance, variety, and you may wanna look at the definitions of proportion, okay?\u000a  Okay, we are completely, totally, and absolutely, confused of analysis.\u000a  I'm not! You're just--\u000a  Analysis, okay.\u000a  I'm not!\u000a  I'm completely finished.\u000a  She's going all haywire.\u000a  Okay, what's wrong with analysis here?\u000a  I don't know.\u000a  Nothing!\u000a  Nothing's wrong with the analysis.\u000a  Nothing's wrong with analysis?\u000a  She's going haywire.\u000a  I do not understand what art is.\u000a  Active listening, right hand please. Active listening, left hand. Table four, please. Ladies and gentlemen, when we stopped a moment ago, because we had gotten too loud, let's take it down to a whisper now. That way everybody can hear themselves without getting too loud. So right now, let's take it to a whisper, for our discussions, please. Alright, with analysis what you're doing is you're looking at the principles of design. Don't worry about balance. Let's flip to the beginning. Now, let's look at texture. Do you have a texture in here?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  And what kind of texture do you have?\u000a  Well it's really bumpy, but some of it is smoother, like a snow.\u000a  Okay, so that's what you could talk about in the analysis. Also in the analysis, with balance: is it asymmetrical, symmetrical, or radial? Now, symmetrical is when things are the same on both sides. Radial is when it's radiating out from a point, like a rim or a pizza. Is it either one of those? So, I'd look a little bit at asymmetrical balance, and then variety. I look at the definition, and then determine what variety you see in here, and after that, go ahead and move over to interpretation, okay? That way, if you're being frustrated, you don't have to get bogged down and worry about it, you can move to the next step. You might find that easier, okay? Keep going, thanks. Alright, so y'all are on interpretation now?\u000a  Yep.\u000a  Okay, what are y'all about to do for interpretation? Can someone read me the interpretation part?\u000a  Basically, how does the painting make you feel? What does it make you think of? Don't say you think a painting sucks, artwork sucks. That said, that goes in the next step. What do you think, What do you think the artist is trying to communicate to you as a viewer?\u000a  Okay, so let's bring the painting back over here so you can see it while you're working on the questions, and think about telling me a story, or what's going on. Now, does this look like you're in a cafeteria?\u000a  No.\u000a  Does it look like you're in a school?\u000a  Oh yeah.\u000a  No.\u000a  It looks like a barber shop.\u000a  Okay, and what does it look like is going on in the barber shop?\u000a  He's shaving, cutting someone's hair.\u000a  Now what about over here?\u000a  These guys are probably waiting for their turn.\u000a  Okay, that's what you need to tell me in interpretation. What all is going on, or everything the artist had within the work of art that tells a story. We're talking about the story that's created in the work of art. Alright, what part are y'all on, interpretation?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay, so...\u000a  It kind of makes me feel like...\u000a  It makes me feel sad.\u000a  It was, when I think of it before, and it really doesn't make me feel sad. I'm not really sure how it makes me feel, but I kind of think that maybe he was trying to say, it went from-- 'cause this is kind of simple.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  And I keep going back to the simple and complex for some reason. But, I think he was trying to say that maybe things were simpler, and it kind of got more modern.\u000a  I like that, I like that. And also, one thing that this makes me think of, is earlier this year, we studied the artist Jacob Lawrence, and one of his was a work of art of a guy on a train, controlling that with only industry in the background. With the big cog or wheel here, it kind of looks like a train over here, with industry in the background. But I like what you're saying about the calmer times, and the more difficult times, and I think that would be a great thing to have in your interpretation.\u000a  It doesn't look like a train, though.\u000a  Yeah.  Alright, how are y'all doing? Y'all doin' alright? Hey, what part are y'all workin' on now? Y'all got "Valley Farm?"\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Interpretation.\u000a  Okay, what do y'all have so far for interpretation?\u000a  This painting makes us feel bright, but kind of boring. The smoke from the mountains make us wonder who is making it. We also wonder, "Why is there a fire with nobody there?"\u000a  Okay, sounds good. Ah, can you put your stool back up on two legs? One more time? Thanks. Alright, what are y'all on right now? Analysis, and y'all have moved on to interpretation?\u000a  Mhmm.\u000a  Sounds good. Active listening, right hand. Active listening, left hand. Right in here, we have about seven minutes left. This should give enough time for most everybody to finish their interpretation, and start on their judgment today. After you get finished with your interpretation, one thing I would like you to focus on, is why you think the work of art was created. Think about the time period, in which it was created, and why the artists were creating works of art. Think about your work of art particularly, and you'll be able to have a space on your paper to answer that, so continue working on what you're working on. We have about seven minutes. Next time you come in, what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be working on presenting. So, those groups that have enjoyed this, will be able to look at the Smithsonian packet, find their information, add that to what they've been doing today, and then present on their findings regarding what they thought about the work of art along with what the historians thought about--\u000a

V  First are your group activity, your group creations. Now, you all created, in your group--\u000a  Sorry.\u000a You created in your groups eight counts of dance that incorporated, in some form or fashion, the time step. I don't want - don't grade right now, just look, just watch the first one. \u266a  \u266a \u266a  \u266a What are you noticing? \u266a  \u266a\u000a,  Good, right? So I was telling you that these are the piece of bread and these were a piece of bread and I could have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on white bread, or I can have a peanut butter and jelly on wheat bread. We're going to keep the white bread for right now. Pop push. Then this made me laugh. Think about this as the heel of the bread.\u000a  I don't get it. \u000a  I'm glad to know that you're like "I don't get it." There's a piece of bread and there's a heel of the bread--\u000a  Oh! \u000a  The butt of the bread?\u000a Yeah! Oh, that's why! Because you call it the "butt of the bread". Oh! But it's the heel of the bread. Ok so not so funny. \u000a  So we have pop push, step as our ingredient and then as our butt of the bread, good flap step dig, right? So today we're going to do pop push, step, good flap, step dig as a review on the right and on the left. And then we're going to do pop push, flap, we're going to add another ingredient, flap step dig. Okay? Flap step dig. Now remember--this-- is important, why?\u000a  It's the ingredient.\u000a  barely comes up, think about it.\u000a  Good flap because when you step flap means that it's two sounds to .\u000a  Boo ya! Remember it's two sounds and that's why you say "Good flap" and to get it up, she said, real high. Alright, everybody up,  spread out. Pop push. Pop push again is spank, kick. It's exactly what we did as warm up the one across the board. Put your right heel out. I need a good pop push. Ready and . I need a good step.  As we step, what do we do? What happens to the body?\u000a  We swing right.\u000a  We sure did, pick up that foot. Good flap,  step dig.  Alright, do it one more time. Let's do an echo. Let me do it. I'll do pop push, step, you do\u000a  Pop push, step.\u000a  I do good flap, step dig. You do--\u000a  Good flap, step dig.\u000a  Right, right. And I go.   Okay, I go.  \u000a Better. \u000a  Ok by now our muscle memory is either going "I got it! I've worked it out" or "I don't got it" and we need to correct it before it becomes muscle memory. So here's what I want you to do. Say "Pop push step".\u000a  Pop push step.\u000a  Good flap step dig.\u000a  Good flap step dig.\u000a  Pop push step.\u000a  Pop push step.\u000a  Good flap step dig.\u000a  Good flap step dig.\u000a  Pop push step.\u000a  Pop push step.\u000a  Good flap step dig.\u000a  Good flap step dig.\u000a  Right foot out. Six,  here you go. You take--\u000a  Pop push step\u000a  Good flap step dig.\u000a  Pop push step Good flap step dig.\u000a  You can do a shuffle. Pop push step Good flap step dig. You want to? Okay. \u000a  Not too bad! Look at y'all keep on going just like wonderful kids! Now let me take a dip. What I need you to do real quick: bunch up right here. Bunch up. Do me a favor and... bunch up right there. Do you body roll?\u000a  Not really.\u000a  Yeah you do. \u000a  No.\u000a  Sure you do. Ok well I got it wrong. You don't body roll but you will. You rock, you rock, knee right.  No?  Come on, right hand. Flap, step, dig. See you're doing this really well.  Alright point your leg, listen. We're going flap, step, dig.  Flap, step, dig. Ready? And right foot, step, flap step dig. Yes! \u000a  How is this group doing? Okay everybody look, everybody look! Here we go. Five, six oh you precious thing. Are you ready? Deep breaths. You need your right foot out. Six, ready, and pop push step. Good flap step dig. Almost, left foot. Pop push step Left foot, good flap step dig. Okay, let me tell you why. You're doing a shuffle. We do pop push, step, lift your foot up, good flap step dig, on left foot. Pop push step. Good flap, step dig. These were all two things. Okay, body roll. Do a body roll. Now you can't do a body roll back here.  Hold my hand. Here we go. Pop push. Step. Shift it over. Good, flap step dig, right here. Good flap step dig. Did you get all this? Again the right foot. Flex your toes. Good flap step dig. Good flap step dig.  bring it in. Oh, no you gotta body roll! Bring it in. Good flap step dig. That's better. And since the problem is your weight distribution it's back here and it's hard to do it like this. So you gotta do like this. Yeah? Okay. Alright, let me see the middle group. Middle group! Right foot out. Ready, oh sorry, I got all excited. You were ready. Six, ready, and pop push step. Yes, okay. Let's go pop push step, hold for a second, good flap step dig. Ready? Right foot. And pop push step, hold for a second, good flap step dig. Yes! Left foot, left, foot, left foot. Six, ready, and pop push step, good flap step dig. Almost, almost. I saw it on the right, do it on the left real quick. Left foot and... pop push, push your heel down. Base.  Let me hear some base, do it again. Pop push step, pick up that foot, good flap step dig. Good flap step dig. Left foot, good flap, come on baby.\u000a  With the lift?\u000a  With the lift. Oh sorry, my bad, my bad, to the right. Good flap, step dig. That's it!  Show some love, very nice! Alright this group, come on. Right foot out. Six, ready, and pop push step. Oh I got overachievers I love it! This time with the hold punched in it. Now let me see the hold. Six, ready and pop push step hold for a second good flag step dig. Left foot. Pop push step, hold for a sec, good flap step dig. Love it! Let's take out the hold. Let's take out the hold. Pop push step, good flap step dig. Pop push step, good flap step dig. Five, six, right foot ready and Pop push step, good flap step dig. \u000a  And ready stop. You know what? Not so bad. Alright this is what we're going to do. We're going to move on, we're going to move on. I want to see pop push FLAP. Pop push flap on the right foot. Put your right heel out. Put your right heel out. We're gonna go pop push flap. Where's my head?\u000a  Over you.\u000a  Over the front of the body, that's right. Five, six, ready and pop push flap. Five, six, ready and pop push flap. Yes, five, six, ready and pop push flap. Five, six, ready and pop push flap. Not bad. Five, six, last time in push and freeze. We're going to take a second piece of bread, that heel and go good flap step dig. It happens with the left foot. Five, six, ready and good flap step dig. You already know that part! Isn't that fabulous? So we're going to put together pop push flap, flap step good. Five, six, right foot goes pop push flap, flap step dig. Oh! Wah!

Pop push flap, flap step dig.\u000a  Let me see the next move.\u000a  In the shower?  Be careful you might slip. That's a hazard, always safety first. Yes? Okay, Andra?\u000a  In Walmart.\u000a  In Walmart, really?\u000a  Love it!\u000a  Okay.\u000a  I do mines in Kroger. \u000a  Do you find--okay.\u000a  I do mines in the kitchen.\u000a You do yours in the kitchen. Does your mom yell at you?  No.\u000a Be careful.\u000a  Like when you sit down on the desk in class and you just sit there, all year.\u000a  Okay so Jasline, do your teachers get on to you when you practice in class?\u000a  No cause I'm quiet.\u000a  Because you're quiet. \u000a  Well number one, I'm super proud of you for practicing everywhere. And do you find that you do it all the time? In the store, in the school. So it's not just something that you're going to do in class. You see this? And what you're going to find is odd a lot of former students come back and they go: "Oh, well I continue to do this "and I'm not even taking tapping. "I wish I could go find and tap more." Okay when that's gonna happen, because it is going to happen to you, it's like a bug, it's like a virus, you just get all excited and all that. Go to Youtube for me, and on Youtube, there are lots of how-to videos. Do you know you could look up how to do this time-step on the Youtube video? Now is it going to be your standard buck and wing arc, buck times step?\u000a  No.\u000a  No, it may not be because remember the sandwiches it may be a different kind of sandwich, a different kind of time-step. So, if you're ever curious and you want to continue this through like, because you're gonna. Do you have to have tap shoes by the way?\u000a  No.\u000a  No. What do you have to have?\u000a  Hard floor.\u000a  Tammy, sit up for me. You what?\u000a  A shoe with a hard bottom.\u000a  Yeah. Look, I'm in heels right? That's all you have to do. Now one of the things that I wanted to point out to you as we're about to evaluate yourselves and evaluate your peers, I want you to look at weight distribution. Say "weight distribution".\u000a  Weight distribution.\u000a  What is weight distribution?\u000a  Can I use an example?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Like when we're doing the good flap ball change, you have to move your body up for the good flap and you move it back down for the step-beat.\u000a  Okay, so great, Jasline said that you have to move your body forward on the good flap and then back, and sit it back down, for the step dig. Anybody had something to add?\u000a  Shift your weight.\u000a  Yes, you're right you shift your weight which way?\u000a  Opposite of which way you switch your knee.\u000a  Oh, opposite of which way of whatever foot I'm using because if I have this foot up I've got...  right? Does my body have to turn?\u000a  No.\u000a  No, but it kind of does, don't it? Got some hip action going on right here.  Alright anybody else see any weight distribution? \u000a  We can do the sink, you're kind of down a little bit.\u000a  Okay, I was going to say, I was trying to get to you. The weight distribution doesn't necessarily have to go right to left, right? Or front to back. It can go, up and down. What is the reason we want out weight distribution kind of lowered?\u000a  So we can move.\u000a  Move.\u000a  To have \u000a  to have a better base for what?\u000a  \u000a  Okay so we can keep the rhythm. Because if the rate of speed, speeds up then our rhythm has to stay with it, right? Tell me how different, how important is weight distribution as opposed to females and males? Anybody know the difference? We covered this one. Where's the woman's center of gravity?\u000a  In her glut. \u000a  You are absolutely correct. In her glut, right through here and that's where women tend to put on weight right gravity centers, her center of gravity around her belly, the baby belly and around...\u000a  Idk.\u000a  Oh Idk, alright you don't know? So where is the men's center of gravity? Where do they tend to...\u000a  Torso.\u000a  Torso. Right, their diaphragm and that's where we get that spare tire from. A man's center of gravity, and this is what it means, are we here? There we are. Here's what it means. As the woman's center of gravity if your body can be forward and your bottom is still back and you're fine and dandy. A man, if this is him, he's going forward. He's going to fall. He's not going to be able to keep his weight. So it makes a difference in your body posture and your weight distribution. Yes? Let's look really quickly... Oh, how many of you have taught your significant adult? You taught a significant adult and you taught the time-step. What did you see, anybody?\u000a  Sometimes your parents got the rhythm  has lost. If your parents are a little older than most average parents, let's say like 40s to 50s.\u000a  Good, good.\u000a  Their rhythm has kind lost it. It takes a longer time to teach them. They have to be concentrated because they're like "Uh uh do that again, do that again!".\u000a  Okay, Jasline, that is awesome I'm going to put you on hold for a minute because I have heard from you several times. Let me hear from somebody new. Come on, Audrey.\u000a  I found that I really got my skills from my mom. My fast-learning skills.\u000a  You got your fast learning skills from your mom, awesome!\u000a  She learned real fast.\u000a  She picked it up good. Alright who else?\u000a  Instead of teaching a significant adult I taught my whole family to tap.\u000a  You taught your whole family? Rock on!\u000a  I found out that my youngest brother learned faster than even my mother.\u000a  So why do you think your youngest brother learned faster than your mom?\u000a  I think she slowed down over the years.\u000a  Over the years, okay. Okay let me hear from somebody up here because I haven't heard anything from up here.\u000a  While I was teaching my mama, my daddy got excited and he wanted to,  so I taught both of them and they decided upon themselves who was going to learn it the quickest and--\u000a  Right, competition--\u000a  And my mama, she actually learned it faster but although it took my daddy more time, once he got it, he could do it over and over again. He actually got pretty good, like speed-wise.\u000a  See? Tap is for all ages guys. It'll keep you in good health, it's something fun, it'll keep you active. You don't have to learn a certain... you know we learned a step and I hate to teach a step but that's the beautiful thing about tapping, it's you can come up with all kinds of stuff. And you know-- Hey, look here,  I want you to hear. How many of you like step, step dancing? Oh, all around the room. Oh, we love the step dancing right? Step and tap are similar, do you see the correlations? You're making rhythms, there are prescribed movements. So we need to really think about the ways that they intersect and it may become the next big thing. You just never know. You might have tap groups all around. Let's go ahead and do some peer evaluation real quick. I want you to watch the screen. Now what I want you to watch--\u000a

V ...boys and girls, for the last week, we have been looking at videos about Dr. Martin Luther King. We've been reading books about Dr. Martin Luther King to get a feel for who he was, why people loved him so much, why laws were changed because of things that he said and things that he did. So, today, we are going to watch another clip of Dr. Martin Luther King. This is probably one of the most famous speeches he ever gave. It was his "I Have a Dream" speech. I don't want you to so much listen to his words today as I want you to think about what else he does as he speaks or while he's speaking that makes him such a great speaker. How does he capture his audience? How does he get people to want to listen to him? Alright. So, I want you to pay close attention. It's just a short clip. Then you'll turn to your partners. So, let's see... Let me go ahead and get this started.\u000a  I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of "interposition" and "nullification," one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together. This is our hope. This is our hope and this is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to...\u000a Okay. I'm going to stop it there. And I want you to tell me first of all, what are some things that you notice that he did to capture his audience? I want you to think about it for a minute. I see lots of hands up. What I want you to do is turn to your share partner first. Talk to your partner about what you saw.  Okay. Let me have your attention back up here. I'm going to write Dr. King in the middle of this web. What I want you all to do is to tell me what are some things that you and your partner discussed about what you saw that made people want to listen and to focus and pay attention to what Dr. King had to say? Sara?\u000a He had hand motions.\u000a He had hand motions.\u000a But there was no hand motions in that clip.\u000a Yeah, there was.\u000a I'm glad that you all saw that. I almost said something. You could kind of see this hand go up, but it was so close. The video was so close. That's why I picked that particular segment because I saw his arm and I thought, "Oh, I hope they get that," because I couldn't find a better clip. Zachary?\u000a The way he said a few words at a time .\u000a Okay.\u000a He said  words at a time and stopped...\u000a Very good. He spaced his words, for lack of something, a better term to use. Zachary said he would say a few words and then he would stop so that people could absorb almost what he was saying and then he could go on. Annie? Okay. Emma?\u000a He spoke in a very low voice so it was really easy to hear him.\u000a Okay. So, his tone of voice, right? We'll put tone of voice. So, it was easy to hear him.\u000a Yeah. And then he didn't mumble. He spoke up really loud.\u000a He spoke loudly. He did not mumble, she said. He spoke loudly.\u000a He spoke very serious.\u000a Yes. He spoke very serious. Jesenya?\u000a He shook his head.\u000a He shook his head, didn't he? He nodded. Very good.\u000a That was my idea. He shook his head.\u000a Or nodded. Dalen?\u000a He was looking at the audience.\u000a Very good. He was looking at the audience. We call that eye contact. He had notes in front of him, but he didn't do this, did he?\u000a No.\u000a He looked up constantly. He might have looked down to see where he was in his speech, but he always looked back at his audience. Lenare?\u000a He said nice words that the people knew.\u000a Okay. The words that he spoke, he had a good message, didn't he? If you have a good message, people are willing to listen to you, too. He was a good, good man. One more. Kalen?\u000a He even had a gooder life-- a better life.\u000a Very good. And that goes kind of along with the words that he spoke-- the good message about having a better life. All right. So, you guys came up with some really good points right here. What I want you to think about when you do your readers theater, I want you to think about how you can incorporate what Dr. Martin Luther King incorporated into his speeches to get people to listen to him so that you're believable in your part, that people can understand what you're saying. So, what we're going to do is we're going to create a rubric together that's going to help you. So, it's called Rubric For Speaking Out for Justice: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a readers theater play, grade two because you guys are second graders. Now, let's take a look at what I've written-- listening, speaking viewing. There's a three, a two and a one. Let's do listening first, okay? Now, if three is the highest, how do you think you can get a three? Sayid?\u000a By getting a one plus two?\u000a Okay. But don't think about math right this moment.\u000a Oh...\u000a I want you to think about if I were grading you, you were grading yourself or your peers were grading you, how would you give yourself a three or someone else a three? Emma?\u000a We start with listening. You wouldn't be just fumbling through your pages of your book and just traveling around. You'd be listening to the other people because you have to know when your part is. You have to be ready.\u000a Very good. You have to know where your part is. Part of doing readers theater is listening to the people that are reading before you because that is going to give you your cue of when it's your turn to speak, okay? So, "I was a good listener." Let's look at number two. How do you think you would get a two? How would you score a two for listening? If the best is that you were a good listener, what would two be? Annie?\u000a Looking at your paper and then like doing something else.\u000a Looking at your paper but doing something else. Maybe looking away, maybe fidgeting. So maybe you tried to listen most of the time, but you had difficulty with it. So, we could say, "I tried to listen most of the time."\u000a Most of the time.\u000a So, what about a one? Kennedy?\u000a I didn't listen at all.\u000a Very good.\u000a Like purposefully not paying attention.\u000a "I forgot to listen." Yeah, you don't decide to do that on purpose, Whitney. Now, the next thing you're going to be scored on is speaking. So, how could you get a three for speaking? Sara?\u000a Don't speak like just normal, like how the actor would speak.\u000a Speak how the actor would speak. Good. Lenore? Let's do a body check, please. I need you all on the carpet.\u000a You're supposed to like listen to what he said .\u000a Okay. Annie?\u000a Like speak a little louder. When you speak loudly, then .\u000a "I spoke loudly enough for people to hear."\u000a, I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama will--\u000a Will be.\u000a Will be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\u000a My dad and I have that dream too.\u000a When we let freedom ring, we will let it rumble. We will let it ring from every village and every hamlet and every state in every city. We will be able to see that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics will join hands and sing the words of the old Negro spirit, "Free at last. Free at last. Thank God almighty. We are free at last."\u000a Dad, when I listen to Reverend King, I know that he's right. I know that things are going to change.\u000a I think you're right.\u000a Act IV--It is now spring of 1963. The speech of Reverend King has continued to lead people and speak out their . He has met with another president, Lyndon B. Johnson, and has seen changes sweep across the country.\u000a May, Billy, please come in here. I have some news.\u000a What is it Mom?\u000a Reverend King is dead. He was shot in Memphis, Tennessee.\u000a No, Mom. That's not fair. He was helping all of us.\u000a I agree, Billy. It isn't fair. But remember, Reverend King lives on in us. Every time we remember the words, every time we speak out against things that are unfair, we are giving remembrance.\u000a Okay? So, go find the people that had your card and have your conversations, get your feedback about how you did.\u000a Miss Walters, I got all three too.\u000a Great. Great.\u000a Did you see me? I had nine points.\u000a You were a good listener.\u000a Very good. Great feedback.\u000a

V  Most friends have finished their first trials. I wanted to talk real quick about what's happened on your first trial. Who wants to share what happened on your first three trials? And I want to know was it something that you predicted would happen? Cody?\u000a  At first we kinda got a little, it kind of got a little complicated. Since you came around it fixed it a little.\u000a  Why was it complicated, cause the rest of the group didn't see your experiment. Why was it complicated?\u000a  Because it keep turning and the wax paper was--\u000a  What kept turning?\u000a  The car\u000a  Your car kept turning?\u000a  Yeah and the wax paper  kept coming off and turning it. So it was a little complicated.\u000a  So after you got it fixed, and after I helped you then what did you find out?\u000a  That it was kind of easy to do.\u000a  So did your measurement, did that end up being what you predicted it was going to be? When it closed did you think the car was going to travel that far or did you think it was gonna go a shorter distance?\u000a  We thought it was gonna-- I thought it was gonna go very far. Because that's a little bit slicker.\u000a  Because that it's slippery. Well I was listening to another group talk about something, I think it was at Bhavana's group, raise your hand if you're in Bhavana's group. And really deep had really good observation. Because they were thinking that it was gonna go a little bit farther too. But you told me something about the surface that we were testing on.\u000a  I said the... the wax paper was a little bit smooth and the carpet was a little bit rough.\u000a  So do you guys agree that the wax paper being smooth and the carpet that we're testing on being rough, if you agree that that has anything to do with how far the car's going to travel, give me a thumb's up. I think that makes a difference. Lucy, why do you think it makes a difference?\u000a  The carpet, there's a  feel of bumps if you could feel it, and the wax paper is slippery. So that's how it makes the difference cause slippery kind of makes stuff fast, like if they have wheels or something, it makes stuff fast.\u000a  That's true. So as we get ready for our next test, you probably only will have time to do maybe one trial. But I want you to predict, now that you've kind of explored the wax paper and you know how far the car will travel, looking at your information, your measurements, I want you to talk with your group about how far you think the car will go on the bumpy surface. And we're choosing to use the shelf liner today. The black shelf liner in your tub. Do you think the car's going to go farther or a shorter distance than what you measured on your first trial? We may only get through one trial. And that is okay. Alright but I want you to talk about it with your groups first and then start. So Lawson what are you gonna do first before you test?\u000a  Get in a group meeting and sit down and meet\u000a  Yeah and talk about your predictions first. That's what good scientists do. They're always making really good predictions about what they've observed. Alright. Go. \u000a  I'm setting the timer.\u000a  I think it will go really bumpy, well not really bumpy but a little bumpy. And it might go just a little less than the smooth.\u000a  I think that it will go slower because the surface it's really bumpy and one time I went on this bumpy slide and I did not go down very quickly. \u000a  Don't worry about recording the information right now but we'll record in a little bit.\u000a  I think they're gonna go a little bit far.\u000a  I bet slower.\u000a  Hey, you can't pick off of me!\u000a  I think that it's gonna go farther and faster.\u000a  I think it's gonna go a little bit farther and a little bit faster.\u000a  I think it's gonna go a little bit slower.\u000a  I think it's  kind of gonna go, since it's bumpy it's gonna slow it down.\u000a  I think it was gonna go farther.\u000a  Group meeting's over! \u000a  So you think it's gonna go faster than it did on the wax paper?\u000a  No I think it's going a little bit slower but still a little fast, like medium.\u000a  So you don't think it's gonna change that much, why do you think that?\u000a  Cause it doesn't feel too too bumpy.\u000a  It doesn't feel too too bumpy, she's making a really good observation. What do you think Jaylin?\u000a  My predict is  when you put the car on it it's gonna kinda go medium, it might go a little bit slower and a little bit fast, and then when it gets to the carpet it's gonna go slower and then it's gonna turn.\u000a  It's gonna go a lot slower and then it's going to turn?\u000a  I think like that fast.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Not too fast, not as fast as the wax paper\u000a  Go ahead and test but let's think about your setup here. Before you move this, let's look at your setup. As the car rolls, what would happen maybe if it stays in motion until it gets to that green rug? What might happen?\u000a  It might get stopped.\u000a  Remember the car's going to continue to move until something makes it stop. So what might you want to do with your ramp?\u000a  We might want it to  be here so it will go straighter?\u000a  But it might bump  into the black box.\u000a  It may, well you know the rug is going to--\u000a  I don't mean there, but I mean...\u000a  I know what we could do, we could do it this way so it won't crash.\u000a  Well you could either move it over just a little bit so that it has nothing in its way.\u000a  Javier could you go get us some tape?\u000a  It may not even need tape it might cling to it without the tape. Try it and see.\u000a  Let's try it without some.\u000a  Yeah it doesn't even need tape.\u000a  Who's the task manager here?\u000a  Me\u000a  Look out he's doing the first test.\u000a  I think it should be Jaylin.\u000a  Okay, Jaylin now do you test sideways, we talked about this yesterday when you wouldn't agree. And you guys talked about that if some friends tested sideways and some friends teted behind the ramp that it may make a difference. Then you guys said you wanted to keep it the same.\u000a  Javier can you move out of the way?\u000a  You ready?\u000a  Now wait a minute, wait a minute. Cause I bet you probably got his on tape. Jaylin show me how you did that again, go get the car. Watch what he did with his popsicle stick. Cause I hadn't seen that before. Do it just like you did the first time. What did he do with his popsicle stick?\u000a  He flipped it down\u000a  Do you think that makes a difference in your test if he flips it down or raises it up? Why might it make a difference Olivia?\u000a  Because it might, when you put it down you're putting it down fast and I bet it makes the car go a little bit faster. And it gives it some force.\u000a  Did it give it more force? So, Jaylin is this surface the same as this surface? Is this the same as this?\u000a  Yes, I think\u000a  Is this popsicle stick the same as this here?\u000a  No.\u000a  So if you test the car on this and this is that going to be the same as testing it on something bumpy?\u000a  No.\u000a  So what do you need to do with the popsicle stick?\u000a  Raise it up.\u000a  You might want to raise it up next time. Alright? Try it again. I'll come back and see if you guys are ready.\u000a  One, two, and go!\u000a  Wow that was great!\u000a  Now let's start measuring\u000a  Now we're gonna start measuring.\u000a  Okay \u000a  Okay, one, two...\u000a  No, Tessa's gotta do that.\u000a  One, two three ready.\u000a  Oh my gosh we were right.  \u000a  Our first prediction is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight! \u000a  It's eight!\u000a  Oh my gosh!\u000a  Why's it eight? \u000a  And ours keeps getting a mess up!\u000a  I predicted eight, too, see?\u000a  I predicted seven mostly.\u000a  We got eight cubes on this one\u000a  Eight cubes, really? Before we clean up I would like for you to have a quick group meeting about what you learned about the different surfaces so far. Quickly sit down with your group and have a quick group meeting. I'm gonna come around and be watching. Quick, quick, quick! It's almost time for us to go.\u000a  About what you learned?\u000a  What you learned today about the wax paper and the bumpy surface that you used, the shelf liner. What did you learn from what you tested?\u000a  I learned that the bumpy surface made it go, that bumpy makes things go slower and that smooth makes things go faster.\u000a  How do you know that?\u000a  Because when we use the smooth it went further\u000a  How far did it go?\u000a  It went about-- \u000a  eight cubes.\u000a  No\u000a  I think it actually went seven. I don't know we didn't put the lines behind it.\u000a  36 about further than this because it went 36 or so and this only went eight cubes. So that makes it the point where bumpy is slower.\u000a  So 35 on the wax and only eight on the bumpy? The shelf liner?\u000a  I think it was seven on the bumpy.\u000a  Big difference isn't it? Is that what you predicted?\u000a  No I didn't predict eight\u000a  I predicted 16\u000a  No I didn't predict on the bumpy, but I predicted... I predicted one and I got the right answer for it on smooth.\u000a  Alright. Well you guys have two more trials to do so we'll see if your numbers are close when you use trial two and three. Alright? Go ahead and get cleaned up.\u000a  We already cleaned most of them first\u000a  Well no you need to clean all your things up everything back in your tub. You can go ahead and record your data but we're gonna get cleaned up. Go ahead and get cleaned up.\u000a  Alright push the red button, you can push the red button. Mary, come over here. Tell us what you learned.\u000a  Okay Mary, come over here.\u000a  I learned that different surfaces can make something different, whatever you're testing make it go fast and slow.\u000a Mary what did you learn?\u000a  I learned mostly the same thing except when we did that, you know how this is less bumpy than the carpet? It makes this go faster than the carpet, which makes a difference.\u000a  Yeah. Jaylin what did you learn?\u000a  I learned if you put the car on this it's gonna go a little bit faster. If you put it on this it's gonna go a little bit almost fast. And it's gonna stop and go slower and that's why it went right there.\u000a  Okay does anybody have anything else?\u000a  Javier what did you learn?\u000a  Well I learned that if it's smoother it's quicker. But if it's a little bumpy, it's slower. That's it.\u000a  Alright everyone put  your things in the bucket. \u000a

V  She saw sparks in the sky and a beautiful panda bear appeared in front of her.\u000a  Don't be scared, I'm your Fairy Panda Bear. I will turn you into a beautiful princess so you can go to the parade.\u000a  But I don't have anything to wear!\u000a  I will wave my bamboo wand and I will take care of it.\u000a  The Fairy Panda Bear waved her wand, and suddenly Daisy was dressed in a lovely gown. On her neck was a dragon necklace that glowed.\u000a  Don't forget, when the fireworks are over the magic is done.\u000a  Daisy walked up to the celebration, and everyone looked at her. No one knew who this beautiful princess was. The Prince of China saw her from across the parade. He went right to her and said,\u000a  Hello beautiful princess. I like your outfit. Do you want to hold my dragon puppet with me?\u000a  Sure!\u000a  Daisy was having the best time of her life at the parade. Suddenly, she saw the fireworks show in the night sky and she knew she must leave before the magic wore off.\u000a  Sorry, I had a wonderful time but I have to go.\u000a  Daisy turned and ran, but she caught her dragon necklace on a stair post and it fell off. It stopped glowing as it hit the ground and the prince picked it up.\u000a  But I don't even know your name! I feel nervous because something bad might happen.\u000a  The Prince looked all over town for the girl who would make the dragon necklace glow. He went to Daisy's animal farm. Out in the distance the Prince saw a little shadow by the animal pen. Could that be the girl from the parade?\u000a  Can I try the necklace on?\u000a  Daisy tried the necklace on and the prince smiled when the dragon lit up like the sun.\u000a  Tomorrow we should be married, right in the morning.\u000a  Alright, then we shall.\u000a  And they lived happily ever after. \u000a  Let's give our puppeteers a round of applause!\u000a  Bravo! Bravo! \u000a  That was awesome you guys! \u000a  Class?\u000a  Yes!\u000a  You're going to earn yourself another smiley. Class class class?\u000a  Yes yes yes!\u000a  Boys and girls if you are on the list of children that are going to go out to work on an art project could you quietly stand up and walk to the door? If you are staying in with me for our work, will you sit hip-to-hip with the  person that...  I'll get it.  No, Ms. Turner wants to do it. Please sit hip-to-hip with your partner. Good job Zoe that was awesome! That was so cool.  Okay, just a second then. Alright,  \u266b turn your bodies this way \u266b\u000a   \u266b Okay \u266b\u000a   \u266b Criss-cross applesauce \u266b\u000a   \u266b Okay \u266b\u000a  Who's your partner?\u000a  Zoe.\u000a  Can you sit hip-to-hip with her? DeShaun face this way. Alright, if your legs are criss-crossed then look up here. Wow. Theodore why don't you pop up and go close the door for me. Alright, this morning when we were talking about the books about China, Xander wrote down a lot of the things we were talking about that were different between us and the people that live in China. So as a class we figured out that they have a different flag, they eat with chopsticks, which is really neat,\u000a  We do too.\u000a  Sometimes we do,  right? They have a different alphabet, they have water buffalos there, they have the Great Wall of China, and they speak a different language. And they also have dragon puppets which you just saw on the...\u000a  Puppet show!\u000a  What we're gonna to do now is we're gonna talk about things that are the same between our culture and the Chinese culture and we're gonna use our listening stones. So Toban, I'm gonna be coming around and I'm gonna give a listening stone to one of the people in the group, and if you're holding the listening stone you're gonna say one thing that's the same and then you're gonna pass it to your partner and they're going to say one thing that's the same. And then they're gonna pass it back, and we're gonna go back and forth and see if we can start to talk about what's the same. We know a lot of things that are different. I'm curious of what's the same. Could you please sit knee-to-knee with your partner? Can we show them knee-to-knee Zoe? Like this? Facing your partner, like we do-- There you go! I'll give you a Band-Aid in a minute Finn, okay? Can you sit knee-to-knee with Graham? Like this?\u000a  I have another thing that is dis--\u000a  Another thing that's different?\u000a  Uh-huh.\u000a  What?\u000a  They have more dramatic designs on their clothes.\u000a  They have more dramatic designs on their clothes? We saw that in our research material. As soon as you get the listening stone, I want you to say something that's the same-- and RJ you might want to start saying like, "we both..." might be a way to help okay?  RJ you have the listening stone. Okay? So look at Zoe, listen with your eyes and your body and say, "we both..." and see how many things you can think of. \u000a  Can I be the stone keeper?\u000a  You may, yes.\u000a  We are the same as them, because we all... \u000a  We all have eyes.\u000a  We all have eyes, yep.\u000a  We all have clothing.\u000a  We all have hands. We both can see!\u000a  We are the same as them.\u000a  How are we the same as them?\u000a  We wear clothes.\u000a  We all have to wear clothes, right?\u000a  We all have beds?\u000a  We all have beds.\u000a  Can we do something different?\u000a  You may say something different, yeah.\u000a  We both have to sit down.\u000a  We both have a mouth.\u000a  We all have hair, yep.\u000a  No, some people can be bald.\u000a  That's true,  some people can be bald. What else between us and the Chinese culture is the same? We all have shoes.  We can all walk and we can all do things.\u000a  We all have bodies.\u000a  Did you guys see  anything from the puppet show that made you think of something that's the same between us? What?\u000a  We all can make things.\u000a  We can all create things and be really creative. Did you see something from the puppet show that made you think we were the same? \u000a  We all have clothes. Did you see the clothes on the puppet show?\u000a  We all have dragon puppets?\u000a  There are a lot of dragon puppets at Chinese New Year.\u000a  Oh, we all have puppets.\u000a  We all use puppets.\u000a  That's what I was just going to say!\u000a  Okay, we all use puppets.\u000a  We all have an alphabet.\u000a  We all have an alphabet, even though it looks different. Alright I'm going to see if we can earn another point. Class?\u000a  Yes?\u000a   That was so good. Boys and girls hey, can everyone turn their bodies this way? Alright let's share out now, we had the chance to pass the stone back and forth, I just wanted to quickly hear one thing per group of something that you thought of that was the same. Zoe and RJ can you tell me one thing that you talked about in your group?\u000a  We both have imaginations.\u000a  We both have imaginations!\u000a  And RJ said we both have brains.\u000a  We're all pretty smart aren't we? Finn and Graham, can you tell me something that was the same?\u000a  We both see.\u000a  We both see.\u000a  We both have rotten teeth.\u000a  What do you mean by that?\u000a  We sometimes all have rotten teeth.\u000a  We have to go to the dentist sometimes? Yeah, okay. Xander and Nazarette, what did you guys find in your group? What? You tell me, what's the same? We both...\u000a  We both can make things like necklaces and fireworks and actually Chinese people were the first people to invent gunpowder and that's what makes fireworks.\u000a  Did you hear that boys and girls? Finn did you hear what Xander said? He said that the Chinese were the first to invent fireworks.\u000a  Because they were the first to invent gunpowder and gunpowder is what powers the fireworks a lot.\u000a  That's cool. Wait wait wait, it's Anna and Toban's turn. Anna and Toban, tell me something that's the same.\u000a  We both have families.\u000a  We both have families. Did you think of one Toban?\u000a  We all have dragons.\u000a  We all have dragons?\u000a  What does that say?\u000a  I'll tell you in  just a minute, okay? And DeShaun and Gabrielle you're the last ones. What's something from your group?\u000a  We talked about...\u000a  We both...\u000a  We both...\u000a  What's something that's the same?\u000a  We all have rainbows.\u000a  We all have rainbows?  Yeah, they see rainbows in China and we see rainbows here. And DeShaun what about you? What's something that's the same between us and the people in China?\u000a  We're gonna have the same melanin as somebody.\u000a  We have the same melanin?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  What do you mean by, "we have the same melanin as somebody?" Here sit up so I can hear you.\u000a  I think he means we have the same melanin in our skin.\u000a  We have the same melanin in our skin?\u000a  Cuz we both have light skin.\u000a  Yeah but what if the people in Africa have...\u000a  I'm not talking about them.\u000a  The people in Africa have dark skin, they have more... melanin.\u000a  Yeah but the people in Asheville.\u000a  Oh, in Asheville. In our city we have lots of different colors of skin and different kinds of melanin but in China did it look like their skin was pretty similar? Yeah, yeah. Alright, so this is what we're gonna do. Does everyone see these circles over here?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  You're gonna come up and you're gonna pick one off our chart and you're gonna go draw a picture of something that's the same between us and the people in China and then you're gonna come and you're gonna stick it back up. And this is actually a word bubble chart. Okay? So when I see you're sitting nicely I'm gonna call you up and you come pick your color and I have brand new markers at the table. Alright, Zoe and Finn come pick your color. Xander and Nancy come pick your circle. You're gonna draw a picture of something that's the same between us and the Chinese culture. You can write words too. Okay, the rest of you. It says, "We will go on hug patrol today." We're gonna see if we can earn it. You're gonna do orange?\u000a  I wanna do pink. \u000a  Can I do green?\u000a  You have to do orange or... Alright. So what's the same boys and girls? Thank you. \u000a  I love brand new markers!\u000a  We have to do something on the same.\u000a  Something that's the same. Anna what are you gonna do?\u000a  We all have families.\u000a  We all have families.\u000a  Can I sit by Anna?\u000a  I'm doing green.\u000a  Can you sit by Anna, yes. Anna, Toban's gonna sit next to you. Sometimes you can say, "we both..." Or "we all..." \u000a  Xander that was cool. How do you spell melanin? You just sound it out. We all have brains, we're all pretty smart? Can you write that in words on there? You guys are such good writers. RJ, what are you writing? what are you writing RJ? Can you read it to me? What do you mean by it, "we all have rooms"?\u000a  We all have our rooms.\u000a  We all have art rooms?\u000a  Bedrooms.\u000a  Oh bedrooms, we all have bedrooms. We're gonna make a word bubble. Can you read it to me? We all...\u000a  We all have a heart.\u000a  We all have a heart.\u000a

V  I'm not gonna have no peace with that. If you feel something, I don't know, something  like done bothered me that done made me like... brought me down to the point where I was crying about it The first thing he say, "I ain't gonna tell nobody, "but I feel where you coming from." He tell me it shouldn't get to that point where you mad over something that doesn't matter. If it's good or not, that seriously don't matter. That's in the past; the past ain't gonna do nothing. The past can't hurt you.\u000a  Okay. Alright.\u000a  That's what I'd tell him.\u000a  So, really this kind of conversation should've been held with what kind of friend?\u000a  A pretty good friend.\u000a  A pretty good friend, or maybe even your best friend. Nope? Not your best friend?\u000a   Oh yes, my best friend. You already know who I'm talking about. He's my best friend. Now, he one of them people that he done did some stuff to me that made me mad. I ask him, "Man, why you doing this? "I thought you was different from everybody else." But, not once have I actually went out there and played the cards while I'm at home. How I'm not gonna tell nobody, and then come two days later, everybody and their momma walking up to him, and asking him questions. "Uh, why you did this to her?"\u000a  So, let me ask you this. So, your saying you've had conversations with your best friend before, and then he's divulged information that you've said to him?\u000a  No, from time to time, he might get mad, and he'll say something, then we have to have that one on one talk. "OK, this was between me and you. I don't want to hear this coming out nobody else's mouth." Cause then I know point blank that you done said something.\u000a  Let me ask you this, if you would have that conversation with someone, is he truly your best friend? Is that a conversation that... Jay, chime in any time. If you got to keep reminding him that, hey man, if you tell somebody something and you gotta be worried about whether their gonna tell it to someone else,\u000a  Honestly. are they really your best friend?\u000a  No. Like I said before, that's another acquaintance, because you can't trust him like that man. He telling you he ain't gonna tell nobody, but he going back on his word.\u000a  He going to get a friend to turn on you in a heartbeat, that's why I said it's about you.\u000a  Johnny? No.\u000a  Between what you say...\u000a  I don't blame Johnny.\u000a  If he's truly your best friend...\u000a  He won't tell nobody.\u000a  He won't tell anybody.\u000a  But then, you got like... it's a boundary between stuff you tell. You can tell your best, best friend something deep, but it's a certain boundary between that which you wouldn't tell him certain stuff. I tell my best friend almost everything, but certain stuff. he don't need to know.\u000a  Right, cause certain things we...\u000a  My business don't need to be his. He have one of those days when he feeling down, then I come over there, "Blah, blah, blah, don't say nothing to me." Then, he flips out on me, and he wanna tell something that's so deep to me that I'm sitting there looking like, did he really just say this.\u000a  Cause your shocked. You're in shock, and...\u000a  You don't never expect, well anybody wouldn't expect their best friend to spill the beans or say something that's not meant to be told. Me, I would never expect Chris to say anything I tell him. So far, he has been a best friend. He don't tell nothing I say. I don't want to have to tell what he tells me, because we got that best friend relationship.\u000a  Cause a best friend should be loyal, all the way to the end.\u000a  Not when it's necessary or needed.\u000a  That's right. Not when it's necessary, but at all times, right?\u000a  Yes ma'am.\u000a  Okay. Alright. Let me go to the next scenario. You decide you would like to take in a movie, but you choose not to go alone. You finally reach someone by phone, who is just as bored as you, and is dying to be in the company of someone pleasant. You both enjoy yourselves so much, you plan to do this again. Where is that person at on the grading scale?\u000a  I'd say that's a group thing, because they interested in the same thing that you're interested in.\u000a  Group friend.\u000a  Okay. Alright, group friend?\u000a  Group friend.\u000a  Someone that you  know through association. Now, in this scenario, it's just you and that person. And, it could be someone that you met through the group. Or, it could be... It's not necessarily your best friend.\u000a  You just started hanging out out of the blue. You met them, and when your friends not around, y'all started to talk a little and get to know more about each other then.\u000a  I'd say that's a pretty good friend.\u000a  Pretty good friend?\u000a  I could say a pretty good friend, cause I would hang out with a pretty good friend.\u000a  A pretty good friend you can take on the outside of school and you can go do activities that both of y'all enjoy.\u000a  Yeah, because a group friend is normally someone you hang out with in a group. Kind of like we're together. Because, once again, you know that person through association of someone else. But, a good friend is someone that you actually can call up and say\u000a  "Okay, you want to go out?"\u000a  Yeah "You wanna go out? Let's go..." It's nothing between you guys. If its a girl, you understand that she just want to see the movie, and I want to see the movie. We laugh, we joke, we go out eat pizza together, but it's nothing else there. We ain't trying to be boyfriend-girlfriend.\u000a  You can't try to make it more then what it is.\u000a  Right. Then, if it's just a friend, one of your dudes that you hang out with, y'all like the same movie. Like, I... You know... You can't call me, cause we're not on the same level. I'm your teacher at all times. Even though you know I like the same type movies you like, and we always discuss the same type of movie, we're not going to go to the movies together.\u000a  Cause you on the adult level, we on the young people level.\u000a  Right, and we're different types of... Our friendship scale is different.\u000a  Is not even up here, it's...\u000a  Right. Okay? Now... Someone approaches you about going to see an exhibit at the museum. You were glad to hear it, because it just happens to be an exhibit that you wanted to see anyway. So, your parents tell you both that you can go, and you can... The exhibit is in a different city. Your parents tell you both that you can go, and you can spend the night over out of town. What kind of friend is that? Is that just an acquaintance?\u000a  That would probably be with like with my best friend. I wouldn't go out of town with somebody that's not by best friend.\u000a  I ain't going to go out of town... I got to go with somebody that I know is going to speak to me. You know what I'm saying?\u000a  mm-hmm\u000a  Got to be somebody I can trust. I don't have to many friends I can trust. I don't know why, but all my friends is just the reason why I don't get too close to them. I can't exactly tell you why. I just don't. Because, I can't trust everybody.\u000a  Okay. Alright.\u000a  Because, you'll never know who will be your best friend today. and, they might turn on you tomorrow, so you'll never know.\u000a  Okay. So, that's why this is a good piece to do. Because, we got to figure out who is just an acquaintance, who is someone we that we will just see on the hall, "hi, how you doing, bye". Got to figure out who is the acquaintance, and then we got to figure out who is the group friend, who is a good friend, who is the best friend. Because, there's somewhere... There's a fine line, like you guys said, there's a fine line between all five of them, but you got to know the line. You got to know where the line is drawn. You got to know the conversations to have with all of them, because there are certain conversations that you would have with that best friend...\u000a  That you want to tell somebody that you just met in the hall.\u000a  Right! Right!\u000a  'Cause there like, "you just telling me your whole business, but you don't really know my name or nothing about me." That's something... The stuff you telling me, I wouldn't tell you. I would tell it to my best friend, but as far as what's going on in my house, I'll probably let you know I got sisters and brothers, the basic stuff, but not oh my momma's strung out, or doing this and that. Cause everybody's business is not your business. Your business is not  are you.\u000a  That's right. We always got to keep that in mind, because so many times I'll get calls from parents, and they'll say, "So and so... Just talking too much." Especially when people are getting into a lot of issues, or getting into confusion at school, or what have you. And, a lot of that comes from the fact that they don't know when to be quiet, or they don't know what to say, or how to say it, or who to approach. Because, if someone says to you... stand up for a minute. In the morning, when you first come in, and the first thing I say to you is what?\u000a  Good morning.\u000a  Good morning. Good morning, Vincent. How you doing?\u000a  Good morning Ms. Jenson.\u000a  How was your weekend?\u000a  I went to my cousin house, I got to spend time with my Godmother, and I went grocery shopping.\u000a  Okay. so that... Now, you told me... I didn't say what did you do.\u000a  Oh.\u000a  I said how was your weekend.\u000a  It was good.\u000a  It was good. And, that's basics of that conversation. It should not be oh guess what? My momma... My momma and her boyfriend was fighting, and they threw the cat out the window, and then the police came over. Because, at that moment, you have just did what?\u000a  Stepped out of bounds.\u000a  You've stepped out of bounds. You've divulged way...\u000a  Too much.\u000a  Too much.\u000a  You done opened the book before it could be read.\u000a   Or you done read the book before it could be bought. Because, really, I didn't buy into all of that. I didn't want all of that.\u000a  You just wanted to know your name, and how was your weekend.\u000a  I just wanted the generalities of it was a good weekend. And then there are times that we could probably get a little deeper.\u000a  But you not asking for that. You just asking for the simple.\u000a  That's right. That's right. Jeremy, I'm going to ask you.... Stand up for a minute. Jay... 'cause you're a pretty secretive guy.\u000a   Mmhm.\u000a  So normally we got to pull stuff out of you. 'Cause I said to you earlier, I said, "Your Dad called. And what was that about?"\u000a    I was stuck on the river.\u000a  And he said, "I was stuck on the river." My first thought was Jeremy got a boat?  So I said, "You got a boat?" That's what I said, right?\u000a  Yeah. I was over there at the Wafflehouse, over there by Brian Gates behind over there at the apartments. I went to see someone.\u000a  And so he went to see someone, but again, sometimes you got to know when to hold your conversation--\u000a  ...and when to divulge it.\u000a  --and when to divulge it. Because, even though he went to see someone, he didn't give me no elaborate details, yeah this honey, she was... Because a lot of times,\u000a  You don't need that.\u000a  I don't need that.\u000a  You just wanted to know where I was at.\u000a  Just wanted to know where you was at. I want to make sure you was okay. Make sure that your Dad got in touch with someone to be able to say, "Jeremy's okay". Okay? Alright?\u000a  Alright.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  You can have a seat.\u000a  That was a good conversation.\u000a  Huh?\u000a  This was a good conversation.\u000a  This was a good conversation? You thought this was a good lesson?\u000a  Today was a good day. It was a good day.\u000a  Because some people don't know their boundaries of talking and telling it all.\u000a  Some people just give up too much information.\u000a  Some people around here got to even say what  did to you and everything.\u000a  From here we're going actually, the next thing we're going to discuss is conversations. That's where we're going to go from here. I wanted us to... because, the other day, we kind of looked at friendship, but I wanted to go a little deeper, because I know.... I want us to realize that friendships... they should be reciprocal.\u000a  Not always.\u000a  And when I say reciprocal, everybody understands what I'm saying?\u000a  The same.\u000a  No.\u000a  Should be the same, like how I feel about you, you should feel that same way about me.\u000a  I feel like you trustworthy, but you feel like I'm going to tell on you any chance I get.\u000a  Right. Exactly. But, they're not always reciprocal, but... keep in mind that friendships are always changing. Because, who you put down on your friendship scale on Thursday...\u000a  It change.\u000a  It changed. You gave me a whole different... not a whole different set, but you gave me some different people, and you actually moved some people. Where you had Yolanda as a good friend, she became just a group friend four days later. Okay, and you had valid reasons, and keep in mind that things do change. Just because someone was a best friend last week....\u000a  Don't mean they going to stay your best friend.\u000a  They're not. Nine times out of 10, I promise you guys. When I was in high school, I could..... there were three, there was four of us, and I considered them my very best friends. Now, I don't know how deep they would've had my back, but I considered them my good friends. We talked on the phone, we shared secrets, we shared stuff, you know, when we was sneaking and doing stuff. We shared those things, but today, I really can't tell you where they're at. Now, there was some friends that I met in college that we're still friends to this day. They're friends that I've had since I came into teaching, that I don't know where those people are. Because I've been teaching... when you think of teaching for 18 years, people have friends... people have come and gone in the teaching profession, but I haven't kept in touch with all of them, because there has to be a... there has to be something in common that's going to keep you friends. It can't just be, I see... if I see them just at school, and that's all we ever talk about is school, and schoolwork, and complain, and fussing, and about lesson plans and stuff, then nine times out of 10 those are just my associates. Those are just acquaintances, people that I pass in the hall. We laugh, we joke, but we don't share any intimate conversation. Okay? I'm glad this was a good exercise for you guys, and next time we're going to look into conversations. The type of conversations you have with each one of those type people.\u000a

V  All right. So, I showed you all that video for three reasons. Number one, I want you to see that volleyball is not a girl's sport. Here in the South a lot of people think of volleyball as a girl sport because we don't have a lot of male high school volleyball teams. I don't know why, we just don't. That's a common misconception, that volleyball is a girl's sport. Everybody in that video was a male. Everybody in that video was over 50 years of age. That means volleyball is a lifetime activity. Raise your hand if you can take a guess at what a lifetime activity is. Yes ma'am.\u000a  A lifetime activity is something you can do when you're older.\u000a  A lifetime activity is something you can do basically for the rest of your life. Would golf be a lifetime activity?\u000a  No.\u000a  Golf?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Golf would be a lifetime activity. There's people 70, 80, 90 years old that are playing golf. As a matter of fact, playing golf is an accomplishment, to be able to go out and shoot your age. So, I'm if I'm 70 and I go out and shoot a good. Golf is a lifetime activity. How about bowling?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  How about tackle football?\u000a  No.\u000a  No. Tackle football would not be a lifetime activity. If I was to go to the YMCA, do you think I would be able to find a league to sign up for tackle football at my age?\u000a  No.\u000a  No. Can I go out to the YMCA and find a volleyball league for somebody my age?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Yes. So, volleyball is what we consider a lifetime activity. Something you can do the rest of your life. Okay, the third thing, those guys were pretty good.\u000a  Mmhmm.\u000a  And they were pretty athletic. So by playing volleyball and staying active, you're going to be more athletic than a lot of people that are your age. So, not only is volleyball a lifetime activity, it's going to help you stay in shape, help you stay active, okay? First thing we're going to do is the serve. With the serve there are a few things we need to remember, okay? First thing I want us to remember with the serve is that the ball must stay at the waist. When we hit it out of our hand, we want it to stay at our waist. If I hold the ball up here and I hit, the ball is going to go up. It's all about the angles, okay? If I hit the ball right here it's going to go up and out like I want  it to go, all right? So, then I want to hit it at my waist. Second thing that we're going to remember is that my opposite foot needs to be forward. If I hit it with my right hand, I want my left leg to be up front, like this. What other activities have we done that your opposite foot is forward? Yes?\u000a  Catching.\u000a  Throwing, right? With the overhand throw we step with our opposite foot. What else? Yes, ma'am?\u000a  The underhand toss.\u000a  The underhand toss, that is exactly right. I think Ms. Beldo taught y'all the underhand toss. Step, tick-tock point. Which foot do we step with?\u000a  The opposite.\u000a  The opposite foot. Do you see a trend? Can you make a little connection there? Opposite foot forwards, okay? Now, the next things that I want you to remember kind of go hand in hand. They are tick-tock. Tick-tock looks like this. Tick. Tock. Pretty easy, right? Tick. Tock. Tick, I want to pull it back. Back here. Tock, our arm is coming forward. Now, we are going to add a little something to the tock part. All the tock, when we do tock, I want you standing like this and do tock. When we do tock, we are actually going to transfer our weight from our back foot going forward into the front foot. What do you think that's going to do? If we transfer that weight forward. Yes?\u000a  If we transfer our weight forward it's going to put more pressure.\u000a  It's going to put more pressure on the ball. Am I plugging it harder or softer?\u000a  Harder.\u000a  Harder. It's going to produce more force. Right? I'm going to hit the ball harder if I do this than if I do this. Does that make sense? Because you're getting that momentum going forward. It's just like in baseball. If I'm playing baseball and I'm standing in the outfield, am I going to throw it harder if I do this or if I do this?\u000a  The one with more force.\u000a  The second one, right? Because my momentum is going forward. Does that make sense? So, my momentum is going forward. Just like in four square. If I'm playing four square and I want to hit the ball and I'm trying to get somebody out in four square am I going to hit it harder if I do this or if I do this?\u000a  That.\u000a  The second one. I get my force from the momentum going forward. That's right, and the last thing I want you to remember with the serve is the follow through. Follow the ball, John will you stand up please? If I want the ball to go to John, my follow through should be towards John, right? If I want the ball going towards the flag, my follow through...\u000a  The flag.\u000a  ...towards the flag. If I want the ball going to the cougar, my follow through...\u000a  The cougar.\u000a  ...going to the cougar. But right now we're working on hitting it straight so my follow through goes to my target. Watch, see me take everything out. Ball's at my waist, my opposite foot is forward, tick...\u000a  Tock.\u000a  Tock, just like that. Okay? We'll do it a little bit farther. Ready, John? Opposite foot forward, ball at the waist, tick, tock. All right. Did you see everything that we had just talked about? Opposite foot forward, ball at the waist, tick, transfer my weight into tock. All right.\u000a  You're kind of hitting it like that.\u000a  I hit it.\u000a  Good. That's great.  Tony, you ready? ...Tony? You ready? Tossin' it up and hittin' it...\u000a And stop just a second, put the ball on the ground. Ball on the ground. A lot of people are doing a good job getting that opposite food forward, but they're not transferring their weight to that foot, they're getting that opposite foot forward and they're standing like this. Am I going to generate much force by doing this?\u000a  No.\u000a  Think about baseball. I could step with that opposite foot, but if I step and then throw is that helping me generate any force?\u000a  No.\u000a  No. I want to step into it. Same way in baseball. When I throw a baseball, I want to step and throw at the same time to get my momentum going forward. We're generating force. So, instead of... Tony, are you ready? Instead of this, opposite foot forward and...like that. I want to generate more force, so I'm going to start with my weight back here and go into it. You see the difference? Ball on the ground please.\u000a  Yes. So, work on generating that force going forward. Okay? Continue. Go.  And... stop just a second. Ball on the ground. All right. One more way that we're going to try to generate force is by following through after we hit the ball. So, instead of... Alex, are you ready? I'm going to serve this to you. Instead of doing this, kind of almost like you're punching the ball and stopping, I'm going to follow through to my target. If Alex is my target, my arm should finish up here at my target. Watch. Do you see the difference in the force between punching it and following through to your target? So, that's another thing to work on. Remember,  if you are doing a good job with the ball that you've got, you can switch to another ball. If you've got one of these big yellow ones and you're doing perfect every time I would recommend switching to either this or one of the yellow and blue ones. Challenge yourself a little bit. Let's go ahead and switch stations so that if you were here, one person walk up here and get a clipboard and paper so you can leave notes for your partner. If you were over there, come over here.\u000a If you weren't over here just put your clipboard on the steps there. \u000a And everybody stop. Put the ball on the ground just a second. No balls in the air. Everybody stand up. Everybody stand up. Alright, put everything on the ground. Everybody should have to free hands. Together, let's work on tick, transfer your weight through to your target. Ryan, go in his place. Tick, arm back, transfer weight, follow through to your target. I still see some people doing this. Where's that ball going to go?\u000a  That way.\u000a  That way. If I'm aiming at the... Ball on the ground. If I'm aiming at the white poster, my follow through is to the white poster. Everybody pick out a target. Tick, step, follow through. Go. Pick out a target, tick, step, follow through. \u000a Go get that ball. We'll get you another ball. Who can raise their hand and tell me the first thing we need to remember for the volleyball serve. Yes, sir?\u000a   \u000a  The first thing we talked about. Yes, ma'am?\u000a   \u000a  The ball should be at your-\u000a  Waist.\u000a  The ball's at your waist. And what is that going to impact? And what's it going to influence?\u000a  How far the ball goes.\u000a  It's going to influence how far the ball goes. All right? So, if the ball is up here, it's going to go where?\u000a  Up.\u000a  Up. If I'm down here, the ball's going to go... Go out, so I want to add my weight in order to get that angle so the ball will go over the net and drop. What's the second thing to remember? Yes, sir?\u000a \u000a Remember, it's what we talked about with the underhand throw, four square, and the overhand throw. Our opposite foot is...\u000a  Forward.\u000a  Forward, right. Our opposite foot is forward. Like this. What's the third thing.\u000a  Shift your weight.\u000a  I want to shift my weight. We actually did tick-tock when I talk about shifting my weight, but shifting our weight is one of the most important things, because that is how we produce--\u000a

V Like compared to osteoblasts... the osteoclasts to be more efficient, and work harder than the osteoclasts, therefore you're  more than you are building, so that ratio can cause brittle bones.\u000a  So what--Okay,  right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a One's up, one goes down.\u000a Yeah, if you're taking away more than you're putting back--\u000a No, I'm sorry, why don't osteo...\u000a 'Cause there's a lack of estrogen and, or testosterone that is triggering the osteoblasts to work.\u000a We kind of hit on that a little, I don't know.\u000a I kinda did, but I kinda didn't.\u000a What causes osteoblasts to work?\u000a That it? Okay, so when they're saying that the osteoclasts are working more, what they're not saying more than they used to work, they're saying more compared to the osteoblasts, okay? It's not like the osteoclasts have been activated and are elevating their activity. They're just doing what they do. It's just because the blast activity dropped, which you guys got that, the blast activity dropped. Why did that blast activity drop?\u000a Because there weren't enough hormones to trigger the action of osteoblasting Good.\u000a Is everybody get that? 'Cause see now, the blast activity's what's really dropping. And the clast activity keeps going, like it normally goes, but relative to one another, you have more clast activity, less blast activity and therefore you're losing bone. Everybody got that idea? Okay, good, you did a good job reasoning that out. Okay, you can keep going, Matt.\u000a Okay, our next question kind of gets off of like, the description of osteoblasts and it says, "How can osteoblasts-- or, how can osteoporosis be prevented?" Brooke? \u000a Well, they recommend having, like, a good number, a good amount of calcium intake, a day, about 1,000, 1,500 milligrams, you could do that, something simple like that could prevent like, osteoporosis in the long run.\u000a All right.\u000a I would also suggest regular exercise in order to, kind of build up the bones with weight bearing exercise, so that there's less, there's more bone actually broken down.\u000a Basically, a healthy lifestyle and refraining from smoking and alcohol lots of other stuff and then bisphosphonate for extremely high risk.\u000a Along with everything else, there's a, I went to the Food and Drug Administration, you can have Zoledronic acid, which can be injected every two years for, like, prevention along with the diet and exercise.\u000a Anybody else have anything they'd like to add?\u000a I was going to say hormone replacement therapy then some other... \u000a Nobody else? Okay. Now who's on to how is osteoporosis diagnosed?\u000a Yeah, I found the most current one is a form called Dual Energy X-ray Reabsorption Test to test the bone density, you get a score of either one or below, means you're normal, one to 2.5 is osteoporosis, 2.5 and above it's just, your bones are gonna break any time.\u000a All right. Anybody else?\u000a There's just a bunch of ways that they measure the bone density, so there's like a centimeter scanner and then a quantitative,  that's what they use, 'cause it's like really hard to detect osteoporosis sometimes and not   so you kinda need more ways to test...\u000a Good.\u000a You can also take a sample of your  and analyze it to see if there's any signs of erosion or anything that'll lead to osteoporosis.\u000a Okay, what's that called? Anybody know what that's called? What is it?\u000a Bioscan.\u000a Good.\u000a Before you even go to the doctor, like, it's  really hard to diag--, like, there's not really symptoms of it. But some of the symptoms are like  bone pain and tenderness and stuff like that, and breaking bones with little or no trauma.\u000a What do we call that when a bone breaks with little or no trauma? What kind of fracture?\u000a Traumatic.\u000a Traumatic would be if it was, kind of trauma. Pathological, good job, yeah! Pathological fracture, that would be a pathological fracture, if there's a disease under there, like osteoporosis, which has made it weak enough to break. Good call! So, somebody mentioned the scanner, Zach, right? You talked about that? The abbreviated, what did, what was the full name of that scan again?\u000a Dual Energy X-ray Absorption.\u000a Okay, has anyone ever heard of a DEX scan? DEXA scanner, that's where the D-E-X comes from, Dual Energy X-ray, DEXA scan, and that's very common, yeah?\u000a Is that like what the guy from Pursuit of Happiness, ... ?\u000a Yeah.\u000a I don't know if you ever saw that movie.\u000a I didn't.\u000a Yeah, the bone density scanner.\u000a I didn't know if that was it.\u000a Yeah, okay, so, how did they, what the general, how they actually, what bones do they look at in the scanner?\u000a I think it was the wrist, the hip and the spine those are the most common places for osteoporosis.\u000a The lumbar part of your spine, because that's the first to go\u000a Why?\u000a What else is important to consider if you, if you think about the type of bone being affected, what type of bone being affected? What type of bone? I should remember.\u000a Trabeculae.\u000a Yeah, so that's a spongy bone, right? So trabeculae of the spongy bone, why would the lumbar vertebrae be particularly vulnerable now?\u000a It's a spongy bone.\u000a Yeah, it's an irregular shaped bone, but the body of the vertebrae, is basically a cortex in, and it's a spongy bone in there, it's all trabeculae. What was the other bones that you said, Madhura?\u000a Wrist and hip.\u000a Okay, so hip as in, what do you mean by that do you think, Robert?\u000a Ilium.\u000a Ilium!\u000a It's all a spongy bone.\u000a A spongy bone in the ilium, good place to look for it. But, here's the thing, what about the wrist? How come, think from a practical scenario, how come the wrist? Yeah, Lexi.\u000a I think it's 'cause you use it like, so often, that they  is probably the most common  because you use your wrist for like basically...\u000a Do you use it a lot? Another possible reason?\u000a Yeah, Kevin?\u000a Because it's a lot of like small bones so, they  may be easier to break, or like, be more fragile.\u000a Okay, that's a possibility. Mikey?\u000a I would say 'cause it's easy to get to, like, it's pretty hard to take like--, and actually have your hip where they do like biopsies going in to your hip. It's kinda hard to get like a good angle, but like your wrist can, there's not a lot of like skin or muscle covering it, so they can like put it under a scanner and get a pretty good picture.\u000a Okay, thank you for that. That's exactly  why they use the wrist. I mean the wrist bones, when you think about 'em, you know, they're not weight bearing, so they're probably not the best to evaluate for osteoporosis, it would be better to evaluate weight bearing bones, but they do have spongy bone in them, they're little irregular shaped bones, which have a cortex with some spongy bone. So there is some material in there to evaluate, but you don't have to disrobe, you don't have to do anything, you just put your arm in the machine and they can do what's called a screening, a screening test. Has anyone had a screening test for anything ever before? Or thought of, ever heard of screening tests being done for other things? No? Not familiar with the screening tests?\u000a I think I've had one.\u000a Have you?\u000a Yeah, because, if I had, like, it wasn't for bones though--\u000a It could be for anything.\u000a Like they were looking for appendicitis, but they couldn't find it so they were doing other-- all these other kinds of tests, I don't know if that...\u000a Well, a screening test, it could be, it could be a screening test. Screening tests are basically more generalized testing, not the most specific, but meant just to give you a clue if something needs further evaluation, okay? So if you put your arm in the scanner, and it was towards the low end, it's not the best for making an end all, you know, quantitative diagnosis. But it's a good for determining if we should go ahead and do a scan of the lumbar spine or ilium, you see? So that's why the arm. So it's interesting that you brought that up, that was really good, 'cause it really helps us look at the whole, "Where is this occurring?" and "Why do they use those specific bones?" Okay, Matt, anything else there?\u000a Our next question, we have already said how it's diagnosed, we know what it is. So, how can we treat osteoporosis?\u000a Well I said, I found online that there were really no treatments, like true treatments for osteoporosis. It's more of trying to prevent it, by getting enough calcium and all the other stuff we said before, because you can't really treat it once it's gone.\u000a Well, that's funny, I found something a little different, there's a few medicines right now, like talking about, you've seen all those commercials and weird stuff that actually do prevent it. Now, they're actually saying, like helping you actually reabsorb the calcium that you've lost from the bones. But it's, also something kind of funny I saw, if the bones start to become more dense, they also found that like around your jaw, starts to deteriorate faster, some reason actually get like sore throat. So I was wondering if anyone, try to reason that out. Because I could not figure out why, just your jaw starts losing calcium, but your long bones, start gaining it.\u000a Are you saying that they're taking medication and then they're experiencing pain? So that--\u000a Yeah, like the calcium  to deteriorate. But like your long bones it's like your limbs and everything start to become more dense.\u000a Is your jaw a lot of , is it one of those bones... ?\u000a Yeah, some, but there isn't a whole lot in there, there is some. \u000a Is it a more compact bone?\u000a Probably a more compact bone in your jaw, there isn't a lot of cavity space, or spongy bone space there. Maybe that has something to do with that?\u000a Even having a sore throat, I don't know why that would affect it at all. Maybe because it's a horrible medicine.\u000a I don't know, like the thyroid gland, like this one, or the parathyroid, this is like calcium  like bone absorption, so maybe, I don't know, it's not working as efficiently, so it's not getting the through to the jawbone.\u000a Or maybe it's working too much or something. Maybe since your jaw is losing calcium, and it's kinda gaining, like losing its calcium, so it's probably starting the beginning phases of osteoporosis. Your hyoid bone, isn't your hyoid bone isn't it... ?\u000a Sort of high.\u000a It doesn't really touch any other bones, but it's... kinda in there.\u000a So it's kinda in your throat, so that could be like, I don't know, it's kinda unusual.\u000a Just answer this one with the general area, 'cause there's a lot of instances where you couldn't sit or lay down, for like three hours after you took it because it would deteriorate your esophagus. So I don't know, there were a lot of really bad side effects just...\u000a Well, what I was wondering, I kinda see like some doctors like, just wanted you to be aware in order to treat it would be prevention, would be the other side to treatment, just go do like those lifestyle changes. Instead of like thinking "Oh, I'll wait until these signs come up, and have platelet scans and I'll take medicine." Just to be proactive about it and have those lifestyle changes like not being a smoker and don't drink excessively, and like, have those good workout regimens so you prevent it  rather than treat it.\u000a Yeah, seems like a disease that's either prevented or managed, not so much treated, but I thought, I think someone mentioned this before but the bisphosphonates... 'cause other people who get osteoporosis are people who take corticosteroids, for like, asthma, like in your inhaler. So it's something that inhibits bone breakdown, so it doesn't sound like it treats it, but it kind of manages it so you don't break bones...\u000a Yeah, did anyone request a name, a name brand Fosamax? Did we see that? Yeah? Did they tell you how it worked?\u000a No, actually--\u000a No, well, Fosamax is like, did you see something there, Zach?\u000a Yeah, wasn't that the bisphosphonates bind to the hydrocapsin crystals in bone and inhibit osteo, osteo-something bone reabsorption?\u000a So they're inhibiting which cells?\u000a  Osteoclasts.\u000a Okay, yeah, so that's how Fosamax and those work. They inhibit the osteoclasts, so they're not building bone, though You see the difference?\u000a Yeah.\u000a They're not really building the bone, they're stopping the erosion, it's a little different.\u000a But if you have like dead bone, or old bone that needs to be replaced, wouldn't that just inhibit it just as much because there's still old calcium sitting in your leg that... ? I don't know, whenever there's waste in your body that doesn't get dealt with, I mean, like when you have an appendectomy and there's waste in your appendix, that like, it can kill you if there's like waste in your body. So, maybe that would just prolong the process of osteoporosis, not so much as help it in the long run. I'm thinking, 'cause, any time you're keeping like, something that's old in your body that's not good. Like, you eat something, you have to like, you have to digest it, and I don't know.\u000a Yeah, it's a good thought process. Good thought process. So that's what Fosamax works that way. So if we were gonna try and design something and our job is to design a drug that helps, let's say someone who has osteoporosis, let's assume they have it now. What types of mechanisms, in other words, what types of things will we try and get a drug to do? What would we want it to do?\u000a You want it to like stimulate the osteoblasts like a little bit better. And someone already mentioned this, but they had like estrogen supplements, like supposedly like help out with that. Maybe stimulating more osteoblast ability.\u000a Okay, well go with that a little bit about the estrogen replacement. Did anyone request that as a therapy? Yeah, Kevin?\u000a And there's like these, like it's, like hormone therapy and we have like estrogen patches, where you can take it as a pill. So it adds estrogen to your body so, it balances out your loss of estrogen, and raises it.\u000a Yeah, there's like, he was talking about the hormone replacement, but I also read on Google Health that it's rarely used and it's not used twice with women. I don't know if that has anything to do with it,  I can Google it. I guess like if you use the treatment once .\u000a Any ideas why? Anybody find out why estrogen replacement, they used to, you know what? They used to give estrogen like they give vitamins, it used to be "prevent osteoporosis by taking extra estrogen." Seriously, and it wasn't all that long ago, how come it isn't get--\u000a Because then your body stops producing, its like, natural estrogen, so...\u000a Good idea, maybe. Any other poss--, Nick any idea you can think of?\u000a I don't know, you're not producing enough?\u000a So because you're not, we should get more, well, how come, have anybody heard of anything that's related to estrogen therapy, bad things? \u000aFacial hair growth\u000a Well, testosterone can increase facial hair growth, someone else over here?\u000aCancer.\u000a Cancer, and that's the problem, they saw incidences of, particularly breast cancer, went up substantially, and so that's why, Artie, they're saying that, you know, hormone replacement, it's still being used--\u000a It's rarely used.\u000a Yeah, but not like it used to be, not like it used to be.\u000a So if we could stimulate the osteoclasts to work properly, or blasts, to work properly then shouldn't you like, have like some sort of treatment to, like,  make the osteoclasts work as efficiently as the osteoblasts? We would have like, sort of a difference in their relationship.\u000a Good idea.\u000a But isn't that the job of the osteocytes to basically maintain the bone? So shouldn't we find a way to, like, make sure that the osteocytes are maintaining the bone? Because if the osteoblasts are going to do their job once they're stimulated. But they have to be stimulated, so show me if you're looking for a way to stimulate them more than... make a more efficient solution at the osteocytes.\u000a No, that would be more like a genetic thing, 'cause your osteocytes, your DNA is like breaking down as you get older. So it's like not, it's like, I don't know, is it mutating? When it gets older? I don't know a lot about genetics, but I know your DNA kinda breaks down as you get older, and so that makes your cells not as efficient. So it might be more of a DNA kinda thing. Where you have to engineer that DNA-wise to make your osteocytes work just as well when you're, like, 78 as when you're 12. So it might be in like that area, but I don't know a lot about that, so...\u000a Yeah, it's interesting where you can go with it. All right? You can take this, because even Artie even you were saying something about hormones before with maybe why that treatment gave a sore throat. What were you saying about that?\u000a I don't know, maybe it had to do with the parathyroid gland. I don't know, maybe it like produced too much, I don't know, the jaw bone, and it reached the jawbone first and I thought that it had too much and like released all of it and went to, the rest of the body...\u000a So which hormone of the calcium related hormones would we wanna increase if we thought along those lines?\u000a Maybe that's why your jaw's--, if you release a lot of that hormone then it's building your jaw up and when you're building bone you get growing pains. Maybe it was like a growing pain thing in your jaw? Maybe.\u000a

V Like a long A?\u000a Not long A.\u000a Long O?\u000a No, I'll give you a hint. There's some letters up on the front. What is the sound?\u000a  "Er."\u000a It's "er."\u000a "Er. " Everybody say "er."\u000a  "Er."\u000a Okay. What we're going to do... If you remember last week, we looked at some pictures. And when you heard the "er" sound, what sound did you make?\u000a "Er."\u000a No.\u000a  E-R.\u000a What did you make?\u000a Tweet, tweet.\u000a Tweet, tweet because a bird says tweet, tweet and a bird has "er." So my first picture is a train. Do you hear it?\u000a Yes, ma'am.\u000a No.\u000a Do you hear an "er"?\u000a Oh, no. No.\u000a So are you going to say tweet, tweet?\u000a  No.\u000a No. Shirt.\u000a  Tweet, tweet.\u000a Girl.\u000a  Tweet, tweet.\u000a Bird.\u000a  Tweet, tweet.\u000a Rope.\u000a No.\u000a Skirt.\u000a  Tweet, tweet.\u000a Purse.\u000a  Tweet, tweet.\u000a Shark.\u000a  Tweet, tweet.\u000a Do you hear "er" in shark?\u000a No.\u000a Do you hear the difference? What do you hear? "Ar." That's different. Okay. Let's look really quick, eyes up here. When I have the word skirt, what two letters make "er?"\u000a  I-R.\u000a Very good. This is a nurse. What two letters make "er"?\u000a  U-R.\u000a Good.\u000a Tweet!\u000a This is a fern. What two letters say "er?"\u000a  E-R.\u000a Very good. We're going to read some words, okay? I want you to look at this word first. Connor, look at the word. Everybody, what word is that?\u000a  Sir.\u000a Look at it. Think about it first. What word?\u000a  Fur.\u000a Four.\u000a Fur.\u000a What's this word?\u000a  Fur.\u000a Very good. Think about it first. What word?\u000a  Spur.\u000a Think about it first. What word?\u000a  Hurt.\u000a Think about it. Don't say it. And what word is it?\u000a  Spurt.\u000a Spurt. Very good. Think about it first. What word?\u000a  Nerve.\u000a Think about it. What word?\u000a  Serve.\u000a Think about it.\u000a Nurse.\u000a What word?\u000a  Nurse.\u000a Think about it.\u000a Purse.\u000a What? You're thinking. I can't hear you think. All right. Ready? What word?\u000a  Purse.\u000a Good. Think about it. What word?\u000a  Germ.\u000a Think about it. Don't say it yet. What word?\u000a  Term.\u000a Term. Eyes up here. Okay. Good. Now we're going to go to our work mats and we're going to build some words, okay? Okay. You can give the students a point, because you all did a very good job. Everybody was paying attention and participating. All right, watch how Miss Dodd is doing this because you're going to do the same thing. Get your word mat out in front of you and put your letters out so you can see them. We have to go kind of quick. I'm going to put this on top of this just for now, okay?\u000a Thanks.\u000a You're welcome. All right. Let's see. Let's see how fast we can get those out. Let's see. I'm going to say we can do it in 40 seconds. Let me help you out. Let's put all these out so you can see them.\u000a You have a lot of words.\u000a Shh.\u000a Okay. We're not putting them down on the mat. We're going to put them up here and then we're going to pull them down to the mat. There we go.\u000a Economics.\u000a Shh.\u000a All right. Let's see if we made it. Are we all done?\u000a Yes, ma'am.\u000a All right. Give the students another point because you did it in enough time. Okay. Miss Dodd has the words up here, also, the word parts. So first, let's look at the ending parts, okay? What do you think this says?\u000a  "Er."\u000a "Er." Very good. Look at this next one. What does this say?\u000a  "Urt."\u000a "Urt." Eyes up here. Eyes up here. Good.\u000a What does this say?\u000a  "Er."\u000a Good. What does this say?\u000a  "Urse."\u000a And what does this say?\u000a  "Erve."\u000a Okay. These are the same cards that you have, so we're going to make some words, okay?\u000a Okay.\u000a First, we're going to start with "urt." U-R-T. So let's pull that down to where it says rhyme. U-R-T. Okay? And I want you to make the word hurt. Hurt.\u000a Good job. All right. Let's spell hurt together.\u000a  H-U-R-T. Hurt.\u000a Very good. All right. So Miss Dodd will pull down my H and it looks like everybody got that. Okay. Now I want you to take your U-R. Pull down your U-R. Okay? And this time, I'm going to give you a clue. I want you to make the word that is something that is on an animal. Covers an animal. Keeps him warm. His what? We don't want our H right now. Let's see if you can figure it out. You should have U-R right here, okay? And now we're going to... So what was the answer to my clue?\u000a  Fur.\u000a Fur. Spell it.\u000a  F-U-R. Fur.\u000a Keep your U-R and I want you to make the word spur. Spur. We talked about this word last week. A spur. Okay? Yes.\u000a Who put the things out?\u000a I did. Okay. Who remembers what a spur is?\u000a Something that you kick?\u000a Very good. Here's a picture of a spur. Remember there was a thing that the cowboy has on his boots that he kicks the horse and it makes the horse go fast? Okay. So I should pull down my S-P and this word is?\u000a  Spur.\u000a Very good. All right. I want you to pull down your U-R-S-E. U-R-S-E. And you shouldn't have anything in front of the U-R-S-E. You should just have it just like Madison has it here. She doesn't have anything for onset. She only has her rhyme. Okay? All right. What does that part say?\u000a  "Urse."\u000a "Urse." Okay. I want you to add a P and see what word you get and if you have a D, you might want to flip it over. It's also a P. Okay? All right. What word is that?\u000a  Purse.\u000a Purse. Very good. Okay. I want you to take your I-R and pull it down. And this time, I want you to make your own word with I-R. It might not be the same word your neighbor makes. I want you to make your own word with I-R. Look at all the onset parts that you have and see what you can add to "ir." Good job.\u000a All right. Let's look at what we came up with. What did you come up with?\u000a Sir.\u000a Sir. Okay. So I'll pull down my S here. This word is sir. That is correct and I see a few people have sir. Let's see. Let's look at this one. What did you make?\u000a Spir.\u000a But what two letters actually say "ur" in spur?\u000a I-R?\u000a Not I-R. Remember?\u000a U-R.\u000a Yep. Let's put it up here so we remember it. Spur is S-P-U-R.\u000a I've got another one.\u000a All right.\u000a Dirt.\u000a Okay.\u000a Oh, yeah.\u000a How do you spell dirt?\u000a Oh, yeah. Wait. Oh yeah.\u000a We might not have that ending, but do you know how to spell dirt? D...\u000a I-R-T.\u000a Very good. All right. Let's move on to another one. Oh, I see that you have G-I-R. "Gir." What were you thinking when you wrote that? Can you use that in a sentence? No? Okay. This one is not a word, okay? Now we're going to pull out our E-R-V-E. E-R-V-E. Let's see how quickly we can get it up. You all are doing a good job. You're all probably going to get another point. E-R-V-E. Okay? And I want you to fill in the blank. The ladies in the cafeteria blank us our food. The ladies in the cafeteria blank us our food. What can we put in front of the E-R-V-E that would complete that sentence? It's got to make sense. All right. What is this word?\u000a "Erve."\u000a Let's see. What if I were to put an S? What word would I have?\u000a Serve?\u000a Serve. Does that make sense in my sentence? Do the ladies in the cafeteria serve us our food? Yeah. So what word did we come up with?\u000a  Serve.\u000a Serve. Very good. Okay. So this is what I want you to do. I want you to take all your cards just like Miss Dodd's doing here and I'm just going to put them together pretty quick. I don't have to really take my time here and then I'm going to stick them on my page. We're going to make a pile in the middle. Good job. All right. Good. And remember, it doesn't have to be perfect. Good job. And let's take it all...\u000a Is this yours?\u000a Good job.\u000a No.\u000a All right. I'm going to go ahead and hand you our story. We're going to take what we've learned and take it to text. We're going to read a story that has lots of words that have the "er" sound.\u000a This looks like .\u000a I have one.\u000a Yeah. That one's his.\u000a Curls that swirl.\u000a All right.\u000a I can't put it...\u000a Whoa. It's got 12 pages.\u000a Okay. All right. Let me go ahead and take those so we can go ahead and start reading, okay? Okay. You can give the students a point because you did a good job last time. Okay. I'm going to give everybody a highlighter because as we're reading, I want you highlighting words that have the "er" sound. Okay? So what's my title?\u000a  Curls that swirl.\u000a Very good. Do you see some words that have the "er" sound?\u000a Yes, ma'am.\u000a Let's highlight them. What's my first word?\u000a Curls.\u000a U-R.\u000a Curls. What's my next word that has "er"?\u000a  Swirl.\u000a Swirl. Very good. All right. Curls that swirl. What are they talking about, about curls? What kind of curls are they talking about?\u000a Like curls in your hair.\u000a Curls in your hair. Very good. Okay. As we're going, I'm going to be putting the words up here, okay? So we have curls and we have swirl and we will use these words again tomorrow. Okay, so let's open up to the first page.\u000a Miss Dodd? Miss Dodd?\u000a Highlight it again?\u000a No highlighting yet, okay?\u000a Cheryl? Oh, okay. Well, come up. No, no. We're on this page here. Page three at the bottom, okay?\u000a Okay.\u000a Okay. So let's see how quickly we can get to page three. All right. What we're going to do is I want you following along. Miss Dodd's going to model how we're going to read this page. As I'm reading, you can highlight when I say an "er" word. Does everybody understand the directions?\u000a  Yes, ma'am.\u000a Okay, but you need to be listening because after this, we're going to read it all together, okay? Here we go. Once there was a small girl who had hair that curled and swirled and twirled. Drop where you hand is.\u000a I messed up.\u000a That's okay. We'll go back and look at it.\u000a This one?\u000a We'll talk about it. It swirled over her shirt and way past her skirt. Okay. Now. Stop. No, no. We're going to just look at that one page because I see some things that make me ask some questions. What word did you ask me about?\u000a That wasn't me.\u000a Did you ask me about a word? What word?\u000a There.\u000a There. Okay. Let's look at the word there. Okay. Now should we highlight there?\u000a Yes, ma'am.\u000a Raise your hand if you say yes we should. Raise your hand if you say no we shouldn't. Okay. Well, let's look at it. Does it have E-R like we're looking for?\u000a  Yes.\u000a It does, but does it say "er"?\u000a No.\u000a No. It has a different sound. Every E-R isn't going to say "er." It's just going to be special times, so in this case, should we highlight it?\u000a  No.\u000a No, okay. And it's okay if you did, okay? All right. Let's go ahead and read it together now. Everybody follow along. Let's put our finger under the first word or your highlighter is fine.\u000a

V  I think we need the policeman, because he's the only one with a weapon. He's the only one with a weapon though.\u000a  What if he goes crazy? He's the only one with a gun.\u000a  Exactly, that's a good thing, though.\u000a  Wait a sec, why is that a good thing?\u000a  Are you saying he'd shoot us?\u000a  I didn't say it's a good thing if someone could shoot us.\u000a  No, I didn't say that. You said it's a good thing. Explain why you think it's a good thing.\u000a  It's a good thing  because we could stock the food, Drake.\u000a  OK, so he said two things.\u000a  But he might  shoot us because we might be starving and he might start to shoot us. \u000a  We could take him,  he wouldn't shoot us.\u000a  Where you at, Riley, it looks like you're sweating.\u000a  I'm trying to think between you two.\u000a  So you write down what you said you'd do, and you worry about everybody here. Who do you think is the most important? Eileen says the policeman, does everybody agree with that or not?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Why?\u000a   Because  if someone gets hurt-- He can respond to medical stuff? yeah, they're First Responders. It's a good idea. Anybody else? Can you write down reasons why you should keep somebody? Would anybody that you know that works here already? That's good, he's too old, his life would be long. So, the old sir will be able to be productive to society. Think about that. Anything else about the male professor that you maybe thought about?\u000a   --in support of communism. Do you want that in your society or not?\u000a  No.\u000a  Why not?\u000a  Because-- \u000a  Okay, so freedoms  are important to you.\u000a  Mr. Malls?\u000a  Yes, ma'am?\u000a  Send Kyle to the office for a minute, please?\u000a  He's in Miss Crane's room, right now.\u000a  What core are y'all in? Because I told Mr. Wayward where he was supposed to be, and he said he was with you.\u000a  Uh, he, we're actually in 2nd, he's with Miss Crane.\u000a  All right, thank you.\u000a  OK, you can resume. Folks, we're about, I don't know,\u000a  Hey, why should we keep the male professor?\u000a  What's the issue you have?\u000a \u000a  OK, now this is just a question, guys, If someone's not fit, does that mean they have no potential to be helpful to society?\u000a  Nah, they could be really smart.\u000a  OK, they could be really smart. \u000a  But she's nine--\u000a  She's nine?  \u000a  She's nine, so,  are you looking for right now or are you looking for the long run?\u000a  We're talking  about the long run.\u000a  The long run, so you got time. So just consider all aspects, just because maybe just because she has... does she have anything to offer? Let the group decide, it sounds like some people are really for and some maybe are against it. \u000a  If you want a male farmer, say aye.\u000a  Aye.\u000a  If you want the male professional, say aye.\u000a  Aye. \u000a  If you want the female  scientist, say aye.\u000a  Aye.  If you want the  male preacher, say aye.  Aye.\u000a  Definitely female nurse.\u000a  We already have a nurse.\u000a  We already have a nurse!\u000a  Who cares?\u000a  I do.\u000a  In case he dies-- \u000a  But the female med student's only in second year, she hasn't even been to the hospital.\u000a  It might go for four years.\u000a  Exactly.\u000a  We got the scientist and the nurse to help her.\u000a  Plus she'd be off breeding.\u000a  Excuse me?\u000a  No offence. \u000a  You know we only got like thirty minutes.\u000a  We only have fifteen, so...\u000a  Hey, we're about 5 or 10 more minutes, and then I'm gonna stop you in groups and you'll listen. If you have not managed to already make your decisions, here's the key point, here's the key point... Still got a group talking, you need to listen. About five or ten more minutes, you need to come down to your five, you need to have the reasons why you chose the five, and we're gonna share those, and reasons why you did not choose the five you didn't choose. Keep in mind, Edna, keep in mind that five are going with you to start this new civilization that's gonna hopefully flourish, and I hope you're all taking people with, uh, that you know will make it. But there's also, you gotta keep in mind, there's five people you're leaving behind, that most likely is not gonna make it. But you, you're concentrating on who you need to start this new productive society, OK? OK, start closing up in the next five or ten minutes, about who you're choosing, who you're not choosing. Those radiation levels are getting high, very high. Over here especially.\u000a  I know, really!\u000a  I kinda changed  my mind about that. Because she's cute. \u000a  You can't change times and down.\u000a  I'm agreeing with that.\u000a  Say aye again,  if you want-- .\u000a  Aye.\u000a  Finally...\u000a  They wanna take  cripple girl and I'm saying...\u000a  He's still overruled.\u000a  I posed this question  just a minute ago. So, this is, so we can look at mass... So we can look at it two ways, one you're looking at: "She can't do anything, she's gonna be hard to keep, because someone will have to do it, second way of looking at it, she... And she doesn't have her doctor. Uh, is that true? Once she had a doctor. \u000a  OK, and then what else? \u000a  Have you ever heard anything about...\u000a  Yup. \u000a  So what if this person could be maybe a scientist or a...\u000a  It didn't say that.\u000a  But again you're not saying that she is... \u000a  ...you can combine that. OK, continue on. You need to start choosing, maybe 3 or 4 of your 5. And why you're gonna take or why you're not gonna take 'em. \u000a  OK, male professor, too old. \u000a  He's too old!\u000a \u000a  Five minutes! I'm giving you five minutes! Start making decisions. \u000a  But why do we need a  policeman if we got a lot of money? \u000a  Hey, I wanna share some of the tips that some of you were talking about... And one person said, "well, she has the potential to become "any of these things here, she has "the potential to be any of those," so it might something to consider. \u000a  We need extra little kids, and she won't help us with no extra little kids. \u000a  Somebody's ready to go, just about, so you need to make sure you get your five choices. \u000a

V Okay. So if you're having trouble seeing it, you can go back in with a regular pencil brush. Visible enough for you? You can go back in and make it lighter. But right now, the mark makings you're doing is really good. As you want to turn, if you're having trouble making curved lines, you can turn--\u000a Oh, okay. All right, that helps.\u000a Instead of turning the tool, turn the plate and keep pulling towards you.\u000a Okay.\u000a It might make it a little bit easier to make those curves.\u000a Yeah, they're really tough to do. Other than that, it's been fine.\u000a Good.\u000a Is that working now that you, what we talked about yesterday with this little...\u000a Yeah.\u000a ...shadow?\u000a I thought it was kind of--\u000a Okay. And the same thing that I just told Kim, if you're having trouble with the curved lines, you can turn your plate and keep pulling towards you instead of using the tool to curve. All right, but so far what you're doing is good. You're adding all these different values. Continue with that type of texture on the edges because that's working.\u000a I'm just going--\u000a That's okay. Be patient. Have you decided yet how you're gonna treat this area in here?\u000a No, I'm probably gonna do what you initially told me treating the light areas from start from this bottom half and doing--\u000a Okay, so adding a different texture. Are you leaving the text?\u000a I never... I forgot to reprint it so if I do decide...\u000a You'll just have to reverse the text.\u000a Yeah, I know, and I'll, right, add it in.\u000a That's fine.\u000a I think I'll just decide it later.\u000a Yeah, finish your whole overall design first.\u000a Yes, exactly.\u000a And then if you want the text in it, as long as it's reversed so you print it the right way.\u000a Yeah.\u000a You can just reprint it. Okay, sounds good.\u000a Awesome.\u000a Yeah.\u000a So you're just... \u000a  Yeah.\u000a All right, the way you're doing the crosshatching here is really strong so continue that to make sure that it's consistent.\u000a Do I have to make it identical?\u000a No. Well, what do you think? Are these identical persons?\u000a It's like supposed to be but I know I'm not gonna be able to get the exact family on the other side but I think it would look fine if it was different. I kinda want it to look a little messy.\u000a You want there to be a little bit of a different expressive line on each one. I don't think there's anything wrong with making them separate. I know that they're trying to be echoing each other symmetrically.\u000a Yeah.\u000a But all of the textures can be different...\u000a Okay.\u000a ...to add some interest to it.\u000a I think it would be difficult to try to get the exact same thing on the other side.\u000a Right. Don't you think that it might be more expressive to add different types of textures anyway?\u000a Yeah, definitely.\u000a That's good. How did you decide that you're going to treat the inside of the mouth area? Are you gonna leave that dark or do you want it to be light?\u000a Well, there's supposed to be some tongue over here, but over here I'm gonna make it like... I'm gonna try to go solid black in some parts. Like I tried to do that inside the mouth.\u000a Yeah! That's good. That's good.\u000a I want mine to seem .\u000a So then all of those areas then will stay dark?\u000a Yeah.\u000a It'll create a nice shadow. Excellent, that's really good. Are you gonna go off the edge?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Nice, that's really good. Keep it up. And Emily, how's yours coming? Yeah, the same thing. All those little dark areas that you're working on inside in between teeth, now that you've carved out all that area, it's gonna create a darkened tone. And as I mentioned before, all the different stippling areas, that's really good. It's adding some more dimension and more depth to the figure. If you're finding that it's easier for you to pull it off of your initial drawing, if you wanna get a white piece of paper to put underneath or use a separate sheet, it might be a little bit easier to see than using the table.\u000a Okay.\u000a Good, good. This is good.\u000a I'm getting confused of where I'm going because if I did the backgrounds, this is the negative space that I do the crosshatching. Then it would have to continue down here.\u000a So you want to decide all the different types of textures that you're using in between all of it.\u000a Yeah.\u000a All right, so you've got a little bit of the crosshatching here, okay, and you're using illustrative lines over here. So you wanna try and find something in between that's a little bit different. Right?\u000a Uh-huh.\u000a Well, you haven't done any stippling texture yet.\u000a I was working on...\u000a In here? Okay, so in here's gonna be stippling. So right, then this can't be the stippling because it's gonna be next to it.\u000a I was thinking of here, kind of, moving this pattern down and then maybe just, sort of...\u000a Okay, I think that would be a good solution to that.\u000a It's like this area in the background.\u000a Okay. Now what if you decided to leave it for now by following just some of the shadows that are there and creating textures just where these shadows are and then leaving that solid? And then you can make a test print to see if you like the way that looks keeping it solid. Then if you really feel that it needs to have more texture, you can go back into it and add it again.\u000a Okay.\u000a Okay, so in here, like you said, follow the movement of these objects. Okay, this is all the chain inside the bike. So following that movement with your line would make a nice gesture. And then in here just because you have all this texture in here, you might not need to put anything else there.\u000a Okay.\u000a What's your instinct as far as feeling how busy it is now to add extra?\u000a Yeah, it's hard to tell because I'm not sure how it's gonna look when it's printed but I think that might be good. Because it would get kind of crazy. I think it might be nice to have--\u000a And you wanna still have it have a focal point. So if you go crazy with other textures in here, you might be taking away from the focal point of your art work.\u000a Okay.\u000a I'm having a hard time seeing it so you--\u000a I might need to get one of those blue sheets.\u000a Okay. The blue sheets are working? I think, you know what? Emily's been using the table. So maybe that helps her to see her white lines. That has been helping. So if you don't wanna use one of those blue sheets, you can do what she's doing and use the table.\u000a Yeah, I'll do that.\u000a I think I wanna lift it off of the book.\u000a So you can keep it taped to this and then flip the book out from underneath to use it or get a darker sheet of paper to help you see all your lines.\u000a Okay.\u000a Okay. You're still working on your design right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a I think you might be ready to go on to the plexiglass soon.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Because once you figure out what's going on over here...\u000a Yeah, I just have to...\u000a Yeah and all of this positive and negative space is really strong. So what are you deciding to do with all of the other areas? Are you gonna fill them in, too?\u000a Yeah, I think so.\u000a Okay, then did you decide what kind of texture that you wanna put in there when you start etching it, engraving it?\u000a I don't know. I don't know if I should do really fine crosshatching.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a But then should I put a new texture on these?\u000a What do you think? Do you want it to be solid or do you want to have the texture when you make the print?\u000a Because I think if I texture both of them, it'll be a little confusing so maybe these should be plain and not have texture.\u000a Okay, so you can texture crosshatching in the background and then if you make a test print first, you can decide. If they're too solid, then you can go back in with a different texture.\u000a Okay.\u000a Okay. So finish up the regular part of your design first and start working on the engraving part and then you can do a test print and decide if you want to add more later.\u000a Okay.\u000a, Room 221. Students enter through a small entryway. To their right are inspirational displays and to their left is the entryway to a traditional darkroom. This classroom is shared by two teachers. Storage space is limited. In this room, I teach three sections of Photography, Advanced Placement Studio Art, and Advanced Placement Art History. As we open up into the main part of the classroom, storage areas are visible for each class' photographic prints, a whiteboard is visible with posted assignments, and storage space where students retrieve gloves and archival sheets for their negatives. As I pan the room, you can see heated dryers for prints and negatives clearly labeled and accessible. Bulletin boards are set up for project instructions, visual examples, and critique displays. Along the back of the room is a dry-mount press and negative developing chemicals with directions and safety instructions posted throughout. Hanging from above are art history displays created by students to aid in the analysis of modern art movements. Cabinets along the back of the room are clearly labeled for easy retrieval of student supplies. In the center of the room, the printing press is stored for AP Studio Art and set up to allow for safe and organized used. Along the right-hand side of the room, there is a drawing rack for students to store work-in-progress and a light table for the preparing and viewing of photographic negatives. There is an exhaust fan here for safety as well as a paper cutter with a safety guard to avoid accidents. The file cabinets are clearly labeled for storage of student binders. The large cabinet in the back of the room is locked to safely store blades and other potentially dangerous supplies. And at the front of the room are storage bins for students to retrieve missing work or work that they might have been absent to accept. And at the front of the room is the computer for student and teacher use. The projector screen lifts to reveal a whiteboard for demonstrations and instructions.\u000a, Some of you are ready to print, so I wanted to go through the actual printing press process today. Some of you might even be ready to try that today. If you're not ready to try it right after I do the demonstration, you can go back to your etching or engraving, and then by tomorrow, you'll be able to run it through the press. Before I do that, I wanted to share something with you that's a little exciting, and the fact that I actually have a relative who was a professional engraver. My grandfather was an engraver. He started in the 1930s and '40s. After World War II, he was part of something called the GI Bill. Does anybody know what that is?\u000a Oh, I do.\u000a Yeah, what is it?\u000a They pay people to go to college.\u000a Yes, exactly. Yeah. After the World War II veterans came back from war, the government paid for them to go to college. And he went to a college called The Art Students League, which I was just talking with Alex about, and he had an extensive education in figure drawing and he chose the trade of an engraver. I'm going to pass some of these around. These are his actual engraved plates that he lent to me to show you. You can take some of those. So you can see that the tradition of engraving as we talked about yesterday goes back a long time. A hundred years at least or even more. But this is from the early '30s and '40s, these engravings. And these were actual etchings done with the acid bath that I explained that we don't do here because of the safety. You're doing a plexiglass engraving instead without the use of the acid. So I'm going to demonstrate how to do all that inking and you can get to see the difference between the copper plates that I'm passing around now and then the plexiglass plates that we're working with today. And it's kind of cool my grandfather gave those to me and asked if one of you would ink it up and print one for him while we were printing all of this. So I'm going to let one of you use his actual etched plates and then print it for him. All right, so the materials that we have out here include all the different colors of print-making ink. So for the most part, we're going to start with black today, but you can choose any color that you want. So you can see some of the examples that I put up here from past students. One student decided, instead of putting black ink on the white ground, he used white ink on black ground. So that's another method that you might choose to do after learning the basic process. So all the steps that we're going to go over are up here to remind you during the class period during the rest of the week. It's going to remind you of all the steps. So the first step after you've beveled all the edges in your plate that I demonstrated yesterday is to get yourself some print-making ink. And all of these materials will be out for you in front of the room and take it to your desk when you're ready. You'll take a little bit of print-making ink and put it on the plate like this. \u000a Just like that. And you'll use a tool called a brayer. And the brayer will hold your ink and it gives you a nice flat surface to apply the ink onto your plate. So once your brayer is filled with the ink, you'll apply it to the plate. And I'm actually using my grandfather's plate from several years ago. All right, so you'll gently apply the ink over the entire plate. \u000a Okay, just take a seat and I'll hand it out. \u000a All right. And after you have the entire plate inked, you'll check and make sure that you didn't miss any spots. All right, notice that I missed a spot there so I'm going to have to bring it back to the plate to get all of the areas covered. Once you have all the areas covered... And this is just in interest of time, I'll just show you the next step. Once the entire plate is covered, you'll take a small piece of mat board. \u000a I'll just use this instead. Okay, I have little pieces of mat boards for you. Okay, so you're going to take a little piece of mat board or you can use a piece of the wood that I have cut up here. After you apply the entire ground with ink, you have to remove it so you have the clean surface with everything except all the ink that's going to be on your inside lines. This has a dual purpose. It removes some of the ink for you plus it also pushes the ink down into the surface of the plate. This has been prepared for you to take off the excess ink when you're done. This will push all the ink in the surface. Okay, and then once you get most of it removed, then you can take the cheesecloth. I found one of my mat boards. Here we go. All right, so you can use the mat board here to get off most of the ink. And then you can take a piece of cheesecloth like this and you want to wad the cheesecloth into your hand like this so you have a nice solid piece of it in front. This will lift the ink off pretty easily. And after you do this process... This is the messy process, so you should take a paper towel and wash your hands after you're done with this before we move to the printing press. I'll show you how to do that. Sometimes a circular motion with this will help. So I'm going to show so you can all see. Circular motion to get off all of the ink from the surface. I'm showing you this quickly, all the steps, but I have one prepared for us to print with. Just like a cooking show, so it's ready to go. All right, so you're going to use... Flat on the table. I'm showing you this so you can see it, but you're going to do all of this flat at your desk. Get all of the ink off with the cheesecloth. If you run out of space, you could fold it over to a cleaner side and start again. Then the last step before you clean your edges... At this point, if you want to go clean your hands so you don't get it on anything again, you could go clean your hands as well. We'll take a piece of newsprint, a flat piece of newsprint and just buff the top of it again to make sure any last-minute or leftover fingerprints are taken off of it with this piece of paper. The newsprint works the best, so I have cut-up piece of newsprints for you also to make a nice, smooth surface. And before you're ready to print, you could take a Q-tip, dip it in some water, and then clean your edges. So the beveled edge that you made of your printing plates, you should take the Q-tip to clean any ink off of that bevel because the idea is to make sure the bevel around your image is clean. So this print was left up here for a reason. It doesn't have a clean edge. I wanted you to see the difference between a student that cleaned their edge and a student that didn't clean their edge. Okay, this has a nice, clean edge. This has a little bit of ink left on the edge. So when you pull a perfect print, you want to make sure you have a clean edge. And the way you guarantee that is cleaning it off--\u000a

V At first, we put only tap water in it, and then we all of a sudden changed it.\u000a So, but there's still tap water in with the oily water.\u000a So, you think that's why the control got messed up because it had too much\u000a  Well, that's not variables changed.\u000a  my only reason.\u000a What's the other reason?\u000a My other hypothesis for the control cup not growing was, like... the seeds were duds.\u000a  Were your guys's the oil ones? That one's not yours?\u000a  No. Ours is the one that's all grown.\u000a Oh, why don't you go get your cup and show people?\u000a So this is oil? Okay, well the oil one did grow really fast and all of a sudden, it died, it looks like. Kind of. So, like at first, it was normal with that thing, and then, well--\u000a  I don't understand that chart.\u000a Yeah, me neither because it looks like--\u000a It looks like it didn't grow, then it grew really, really fast, then it went down. Super .\u000a What happened was it grew, and then it over-polluted, and then it just died. Looks like that.\u000a Well, like. ... \u000a Well, like, what I don't get is, I see the other oil one, it seems like the oil one is growing bigger than the other ones.\u000a  It just, like, suddenly grew all of a sudden. All the oil is the same with the control, which you have all of a sudden, all of a sudden, also these diagrams. Also, in the control diagram, that went back down to zero centimeters.\u000a I don't know.\u000a Yeah, this chart might have messed up.  Because that means both these plants die.\u000a And then the control regrew.\u000a  Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.\u000a  It doesn't. \u000a It turned white, and then it died and turned brown because on my chart, it grew point... it grew ... it grew 0.14, and then 0.14 again, and then 0.04, so like alive, dead, alive and stuff.\u000a When it grew the second time, did it grow or did it subtract?\u000a The second time, I think it died, and then the last time it just kept on growing, but the first time it started growing, it grew, second time it grew one centimeter.\u000a What did you put in to help it grow? What did you put in it to help it grow?\u000a Oily water.\u000a So, did the oil or the manipulator control grow more?\u000a The...manipulative one  grew more because it grew and then it died.\u000a So, why do you think it did that?\u000a Because, like, I, what I thought is that it was too much oil on it, and then oil gets on the leaf, it like, it helps the plant grow or something. Just killing other--\u000a Doesn't the plant feed off the leaves? So, the oil got spread on the leaves, and then it's feeding the oil, then it died.\u000a Look at yours compared to mine because yours is way more controlled ones than ours does because the only one we had was the experiment plant. \u000a Do you, I think the reason why the vinegar or the acid rain made it grow because, like, acid is good for you, and it's mixed with water, so it's not too bad for the plant. But I think it got way too much acid, and acid actually eats things. It kills it, and that's why I think the plant is all dead because, like you said, Nolan, it did grow, because acid is good for us, but yet when we have too much, it dies. So, that's why I think this plant is all shriveled over.\u000a I agree with you because acid is part water, and that's what rain is, but there's a little bit of acid so water's good for you. But acid, it doesn't grow, it's not good for you, so--\u000a  Well, actually, it is good for you, but not a lot.\u000a I think you're--\u000a Maybe just a little bit of water in it more than acid rain, and then when we kept spraying the acid rain on, maybe it got too much acid rain. And then the acid rain overtook the water and died. So, it like decreased by a lot. That's why I think it's just like the Red Bull because Red Bull is, like gives you really much energy and then you just crash without any energy. See right there? Just like Red Bull.\u000a  It increases and then decreases.\u000a What'd you think, Misha?\u000a Well, yeah. I think like what you said, Nolan, because the regular plant grew just fine, and then that, the experiment grew, like, good, and better than the regular one, but then it, like, the acid overtook the plant just like Nolan said.\u000a What else I noticed about my control plant, it started big at first, and then it decreased in size. Then it got bigger, so it's going off and on in size. So, it actually did kind of better than this because at the end, it did better than that one and the last opposite ...\u000a It like, died, after the second one, it only stayed for a couple of days or a couple weeks.\u000a Yeah, but it was only to a point it was living because, when I did my second observation, it was still kind of full, but it was broken on the side. So it started falling into a point where it fell in and got buried in the oily water, basically. \u000a It died.\u000a My actual skin and everything, the plant grows faster, but it also dies faster, and I figured from like the oils on my hand--\u000a Why do you think it did that?\u000a Because the oil on your hand-- Because the oil on your hand may not be the exact same thing as, like, oils in a car, but oil still has the same base.\u000a But how does it make the plant grow faster if you touch it with your hand?\u000a I don't know. Instead of wearing gloves, maybe it's just the stuff inside of the oils and everything, but it grew faster, and also died faster. Like, the plant that we have now is dying faster, but this one, since it has water normally and everything, it's healthy, and stayed big the whole time. But the other one is like that  but it died.\u000a If you have, what you were saying earlier, when you have oil on your hand, and then it was, you polluted it with oil, don't you think you polluted that one too?\u000a No, well, like, it's, my whole point is that it speeded up the process.\u000a  What speeded up the process?\u000a Like the oil, when I plant a bean or something, when I plant bulbs for tulips or something, and I touch it with my hands instead of my gloves. Then it actually seems, I may just be paranoid, but it grows faster, and then my mom put hers with gloves and it didn't grow as fast. I don't know the depth of that part or something.\u000a I don't get what you're saying. Are you saying that you have a magic touch and you just make plants grow faster? \u000a No, I think it's just the oils of your skin.\u000a So, what would the oils in your skin do for a plant? Like the oil for your plant here?\u000a Is it the same like the oil that we used?\u000a Like, it didn't make them healthy, but it just made it grow faster because this one took a little bit longer to get bigger, but the other one-- Show me your data that suports that.\u000a This?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  What's your data that supports that?\u000a The ... These ones.\u000a Yeah, the one the data that supported it was that, oops, is...  is it went with the control. It already had grown, and it was after a week, and ours still hasn't grown. And it was growing at 0.16 centimeters per day and then the next time, it was growing 2.7 centimeters a day.\u000a  So, what does that tell you?\u000a That it was growing a lot faster, but it wasn't necessarily growing as efficiently.\u000a Okay. What do you mean by inefficient?\u000a Efficient.\u000a What do you mean by efficient?\u000a I mean, like, it grew faster, but it wasn't necessarily healthy for the plant for it to grow so fast.\u000a So, was there other evidence that you would use that would prove that it wasn't healthy?\u000a Yeah, because the leaves now, they're all gross and blotchy, and they're dying and they're crunchy and not as soft and smooth as these. And they have a shine to them because of the oil.\u000a What, did the rate of growth confirm that?\u000a At first, it was kind of spiked for a little bit, and then it started going back down, and now it's dying a lot faster than the natural plant because these plants, it grows in a steady period of time. With that, it grew really fast, and now it's dying really fast.\u000a  So, what conclusion did you get?\u000a That oil still makes the plant grow, but it's not necessarily healthy for it.\u000a Do you agree?\u000a Yeah, because me and ... Because my group, my experiment, when we did this, it was growing super fast, and now it's like dying and stuff. And we think that the oil has a chemical in it that speeds up the process of the plant growing, but then it speeds up and of slows down the process of the plant dying because ...\u000a On the grass a little bit, and the number of leaves will only be like two, and then it shrivels up and died. And then the color would stay light green, and kind of brown, like how it is right now, and then my data was, according to my graph, the acid rain plant grew more than I thought. It grew 25 centimeters, but it started to die because of ...   It turns light brown, and started to die. The leaves increased from two, all the way to six leaves by the end.\u000a Okay. My question was, what would the effect be if I changed the water to salt water, and I put, if I change the water to salt, I predict that the plant will stay the same height as the control plant. I predict a number of leaves will stay the same as the control plant. I predict the color will be white-ish gray-ish. My manipulator variable is water to salt water. According to my data, I was correct because the height was the same, and the number of leaves were the same. The data shows the height of both plants were zero centimeters and the number of leaves was zero on both plants. The rate of the growth was zero. On the salt water, there was crust on it, and it was ...\u000a  Restate that so that Jessica gets it, and see if Jessica knows.\u000a And then like, we were saying, Olivia was talking about maybe how it looks burnt, and then, like, you know how water, it attracts a lot of light, and so people get tan.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Faster, and then so, maybe the shine for the oil maybe, it attracted more of the heat from the light, and it burnt the leaves, so.\u000a  Like, the glisten from it.\u000a  Yeah. Maybe that's why it looks all burnt and...\u000a Because it reminded me of when you see the old movies like how it's a burnt reel,\u000a Piece of paper.\u000a Something like sands off in the reel of a video, and you just see a hole get bigger on the burning screen. That's what it kind of reminded me of...\u000a Because it has a brown wrinkle around it.\u000a And then it's dark, and then it's kind of brown and crisp, so that's what it kind of reminded me of and that's what made me think of it.\u000a Yeah, and then, how I thought of the idea of it attracting the light and heat was how Olivia said that when you're in water, it attracts more heat and light to you, so maybe that's how. So, that's how I got the idea of maybe that's what happened. So, do you have anything to add, Jared?\u000a No.\u000a You, Jessica?\u000a No.\u000a Okay.\u000a Okay, so I think the reason why mine didn't grow like before how the salt would have absorbed the water. Because when Mr. Kelson sprayed it, all of the salt right here, you could feel it. It's all stuck to the top, so the water can't get down to the soil and all that. So, it can't grow at all.  \u000a

V  Okay. Now, when we sang that music scale, we were... We were actually stepping up. We were going from low to high. And if you'll look over at this, you can tell these were the notes that we were singing, from low to high. The first note was a line note. Let's speak it together.\u000a  Line note, space note. Line note, space note. Line note, space note. Line note, space note.\u000a Good job. Those notes were stepping. And if you'll notice here, I've got carpet squares, and I have them with line note and space note.\u000a Line note, space note. Line note, space note. Line note, space note.\u000a Good job. That's what we sang when we sang our scale, and that's the notes that you're seeing up there, are those line notes and those space notes. All right. I'd like for us... Will you please come and find one of those carpet squares and sit behind it? Sit behind the carpet square of your choice. And let's go ahead and sit up tall on our knees. Sit nice and tall on your knees. And the next person, come in and find a carpet square, sit behind it, behind that hand chimes. And I don't think we'll need... We'll need one more person. The next person.\u000a  What about me? \u000a Five. Good job. All right. Now everyone, even if you're sitting in your chairs, you need to practice with me, because we're all going to be playing the hand chimes today. Do not touch your hand chime just yet. Let's all just practice. Start off with your hand up. Put your hand chime down a second. We're going to just practice with our arm only. And it's going to be important that you do a good wrist action because that's going to make a difference in the way that it sounds. All right, watching me. Hold, and again. Hold. Hold. Asanti. Hold. Hold. Okay, stop. Now, people down here, pick up your hand chime, and let's see if we can get that technique going. Get ready? \u266a  \u266a  One more time. Good, Now let's... Just place your fingers there under the bottom to get it to stop. Good. Now, when I point to each person, by yourself, you will play the music scale. So do not play until I point to you. Looking at me, we begin. Start with the low C. \u266a  \u266a Good job! Let's do it again. That's the scale. And these notes are stepping because it's line note, space note, line note, space note. Any time you've got two notes beside of each other, that's a stepping melody. One more time, starting with the lowest C. \u266a  \u266a Good job. Now, put your hand chime down a second. We just heard a stepping melody. Any time that you have a line note and a space note beside of each other, two neighbors playing, that's a stepping melody. I want you to stand up, please, and I'd like for you to stand up. Take your hand chime, hold it, and... \u266a  \u266a That melody. Someone raise your hand and tell me. What did it do, Logan?\u000a  Skipping.\u000a Actually.\u000a  It leaped.\u000a You're exactly right. It leaped. Because look at all these lines and these spaces that did not get to play. That's a leaping melody. Good job. London, do you remember what the difference was between leaping and stepping? I mean leaping and skipping? Can somebody help us? What's the difference between a leap and a skip?\u000a  If you leap, it's more than a skip.\u000a All right. The leaping is more than the skipping. Skipping... All right. You sit down. Put the hand chime down. And you stand up. You keep remaining standing. Take your hand chime and you play. \u266a  \u266a\u000a  That was a skip.\u000a You are exactly right. That's a skip when you just skip over one place, one person. All right. Have a seat. You have a seat. And I'd like for, Ashley, you stand up. And what I want her to do is for four times I'd like you to play your hand chime, watching me. I'm going to let her try. \u266a  \u266a Someone raise your hand. What was that? James, what was that?\u000a  Repeating.\u000a You're exactly right. That was a repeating note. The one person, that one pitch played four times. All right. Sit down, please. Now, will you please stand? You stand and you stand. Watching me. All right. \u266a  \u266a Raise your hand, please. Tell me what was that? Devon.\u000a  Stepping.\u000a A stepping pattern. And it went from high to low. You're exactly right. Have a seat. Now, last week I gave you a piece of paper, and it was something that I wanted you to do to see if you understood about leaping, stepping, and repeating on the music scale. If you'll look over at the Smartboard, there is some notes there on Number 1, some notes on Number 1. And you were last week going to circle an "S" if it was a stepping pattern. You were going to circle an "R" if it was a repeating pattern. Raise your hand if you know what those notes on Number 1 were doing. Christian, put your hand chime down and you can come up, and circle whether those notes in the Number 1, if they were stepping, or if they were repeating. You're exactly right, Christian. How did you know that?\u000a  It was staying on the same note.\u000a Staying on the same note, very good. And thank you for walking around behind those hand chimes. Number 2. Akrista, can you walk around that other way and come right here? And why don't you show us. Put the hand chime down, please. Show us what the notes in Number 2 are doing. Let's see if it's doing a space note, and then a what?\u000a   Line note.\u000a Line note and then a space note. And she is exactly right. Those notes were stepping what?\u000a  Down. \u000a Down. And Number 3. Thank you ma'am. Come this way, right around here. And she's looking at  those music notes, and she's going to be able to tell... They're right here, Number 3. All right. Let's say it with her. Line note.\u000a  Space note. Line note, space note. Line note.\u000a Right here. Are they staying all the same?\u000a  No!\u000a They staying all the same? What are those notes doing?\u000a  They're stepping.\u000a You're exactly right. They're stepping up. Thank you, ma'am. And tiptoe back to your seat. Very good job. Now, I would like for the last two people, B and C. If you'll tiptoe to your seat, I'm going to call you back up here in a few minutes. The rest of the folks, you've got to be sitting up nice and tall, sit up tall on your knees. Let's see if they can play a very familiar tune. I want you looking at the very first note, the... The very first note, Keiani. You have that low C. And what do you notice about C? C, Keiani, what's your note going to be doing? What's the word when you have the same pitch? Re...\u000a  -peating.\u000a Thank you. He has a repeating note. And G, Christian, what are you going to be doing?\u000a  Repeating.\u000a Repeating. Adam, what are you going to be doing?\u000a  Repeating.\u000a Repeating. So we have a lot of repeating notes in this song. Sit up tall on your knees. Sit up tall. Pick your hand chime up. We're going to see if we can play this familiar tune. Waiting. One, two, ready, sound. \u266a  \u266a Very good.\u000a  That was "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."\u000a It was Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. You recognized it. All right. Put your hand chime down a second.\u000a  I was listening.\u000a You heard the melody. All right. Now let me see. Sitting tall. I'm going to get someone that's sitting back there in a chair to help us out a little bit. I think I would like for Christopher. Will you come and point to three people that will be able to show us a stepping melody? Oh, don't raise your hand. We'll let Christian choose. Three people that would be able to play...\u000a  Christopher.\u000a Oh, yeah, Christopher.\u000a Or you can call him "Chris."\u000a That's Christian.\u000a All right. Tell me which three people. Just point to them. All right. He's pointing to you. Stand up with your hand chime. We're talking about stepping now. Stepping. All right. Okay. Chris has pointed to these three, tapped them on the shoulder. Let's see. \u266a  \u266a If you think he picked out three folks that did play a stepping pattern, will you just gives a thumbs up silently?  You're exactly right he did pick...\u000a  He did it.\u000a He did pick three. All right. Put your hand chime down and sit down. I'd like to call on Harmony. Will you pick two people that can show us a leaping melody? Leaping. So you can step behind them and just tap them on the shoulder. Leaping. Leaping. Leaping... Okay. Now, these two people are side by side. There's a line note, and a space note, and they're neighbors. Someone raise your hand and tell me what would they play? What would they be playing if they're neighbors? That would be a stepping. And I wanted a leap, like a frog leaps over a whole lot. So come and see if you can fix it. Real quick. Somebody needs to sit down. Who do you want to sit down? All right. Sit down. And pick somebody that will be a leaping melody. Like a frog leaping, leaps over a whole lot. All right. He stands. Take your hand chime. Play. \u266a  \u266a Now, she leaped over a space note and a line note. Give a thumbs up if you think she did it correctly. Yes, that is a leaping melody. Good. All right. Sit down. Hand chimes still on the floor. I'd like for you to tiptoe very quietly back to your chair. What we did in that song, we had several times that there was repeating notes. We had a few times where we had some stepping, side by side. And we had some leaping melodies. When we played the hand chimes it took several of us to be able to play those melodies, the melody. If you're playing a xylophone though, you could do it right by yourself.\u000a  I can!\u000a I would like, Keiani, will you step around behind here? And Sheridan, you come over and sit behind the xylophone that you choose. And Dev, Devuan, Devuan, walk around here. Walk this way. And he's going to be the teacher. I want you to choose. Sit down on your knees so that they can see what you want them to do. Choose something that you want them to play, and let them see it. Turn it so that they can see it. All right. What do you want them to play?\u000a  Step.\u000a Play a stepping melody. \u266a  \u266a All right. Good, and stop. Now, someone... Both of them did do a stepping melody. But he was playing right here. Can somebody help him out as to what might make it sound better?\u000a  A hit in the middle.\u000a He says, "Hit it in the middle." Hit where the music notes are, those steps. Let's try it again. \u266a  \u266a Play 'em soft. \u266a  \u266a Great job. That is stepping. All right. Choose another one. Oh, now he wants a leap. \u266a  \u266a Good job! What do you want, Devon?\u000a  Devuan!\u000a Devuan. Repeat. \u266a  \u266a Good job. All right, thank you. Put your mallet right there on the instrument. Lay it on the top. That will be quicker for today. And tiptoe back to your seat, walking around the instruments. I'd like for Wes H. to step around and find yourself a xylophone. Step around over here. Akrista.  Sit down tall on your knees. And what do you want them to play? Tell them. She wants you to play a repeating note. \u266a  \u266a Now those were both kind of high repeating notes, very high. Do you think you could play a low one? \u266a  \u266a Good job. Now how did you know that was going to be low, Akrista?\u000a  'Cause the little ones are higher. Bigger ones are low.\u000a You are exactly right. What else do you want them to do. She'd like a what?\u000a

V Okay, guys. I see we'll be looking at investigating fraction multiplication. Okay, so can you read the objective with me please? So, I ...\u000a I will be able to do fraction multiplication.\u000a Okay. I've also put it in Spanish just in case that helps you. Okay, so the first thing I want to discuss with you today, is, what do you think about that? Do you agree or disagree? And then, why? So, one-half, does one-half equal one-half? Why or why not? And then, give me some examples. Okay, Raul.\u000a It's becuase it is one-half. They're the same.\u000a Okay.  Abraham.\u000a It's like you cut a pear in half, it's gonna be in equal parts.\u000a Okay, so you guys are saying it's equal?\u000a Yes. \u000a Okay. What do you think? Eddie believes he thinks the same thing. Taleah, what do you think?\u000a I think it's the same.\u000a You think it's the same? Does everyone think it's the same?\u000a I do.\u000a Until you think, why wouldn't it be the same.\u000a Okay, so Jose is saying why wouldn't they be the same. Okay, so one thing Jose says is he's trying to think of are there any examples why it wouldn't be the same. Joe.\u000a It's not the same because \u000a No, that's just the board point.\u000a Is there a times?\u000a Nope, it's just one over two equals one over two.\u000a I was thinking it was a half times a half.\u000a Okay, so sounds to me like you guys all agree that it's the same. Right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So now, how do you explain to me why you think it's the same? Why you think it's the same? Joe?\u000a Because they have equal parts.\u000a Okay. Equal parts. What do you mean by equal parts?\u000a They have the same fraction.\u000a Okay. Jose.\u000a They're both practically the same thing.\u000a What do you mean by practically the same thing?\u000a That once you cut a square in half, you have equal parts, and they're gonna be the same thing.\u000a Okay. Who is someone we haven't heard from? Madeline, what do you think? So I heard you say they are the same, right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a So why do you think they are the same?\u000a 'Cause they're both equal parts and the same 'cause half equals a half.\u000a Okay. Antonio, what do you think? Think it's the same? So, sounds like we're all thinking it's the same, okay. Abraham, what do you think?\u000a I think they equal the same thing.\u000a Equals the same thing. Okay, so now let's take a look at ... maybe, 'cause it sounds like we're all on the same path here. So let's take a look at something else. Are they really the same? Is that half of a ...\u000a Cookie.\u000a Cookie. Half of a cookie. Half a ...\u000a Pizza.\u000a Are they the same?\u000a No.\u000a Yes.\u000a One at a time, 'cause I'm hearing a lot of good stuff, but you guys are all saying it at the same time. Okay. Miguel.\u000a They're the same, 'cause if they weren't,  the same is just half.\u000a So I'm hearing, they're the same, but one's bigger than the other one, 'cause one's a pizza and one's a cookie.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Tina, you're kind of shaking your head. What do you think about that?\u000a I think they're both the same, 'cause they're still one-half they are just different size.\u000a Victoria, what do you think? Same or not the same?\u000a Same 'cause it's still half.\u000a Okay, so let me ask you this: I'm hearing a couple things, and it's kind of contradicting itself. Meaning you're saying one thing, but you're also saying the opposite. Like I heard it's the same because it's one-half, but it's different because it's ..\u000a Different sizes?\u000a different sizes. You just told me it's the same, but now you're telling me it's different sizes. \u000a They are both fattening!\u000a Oh, cookies and pizza are both fattening? Okay. Felice.\u000a Why I think they're still the same is because a half is a half no matter whether it's big or small because it's still chopped in half.\u000a Okay. So if a half of a half, so would you rather have half of $10, or half of $100?\u000a Half of a $100!\u000a Why?\u000a Because it's bigger!\u000a Because it's bigger. But I thought it was the same?\u000a No.\u000a No, 'cause it's the same thing.\u000a It's still half, but you're commenting, half of a hundred ...\u000a It has to be the same thing. Like the pizza, a whole pizza, and you cut it in half.\u000a Okay, you say it has to be the same thing for what to happen?\u000a For it to be half.\u000a For it to be half. But here, it's not the same thing. You're saying to me that it is equal. So which is it? \u000a So now you're saying you don't think they're the same.\u000a No. You get more pieces than a cookie.\u000a They're still the same.\u000a They're still half.\u000a Okay, so who still agrees that the one-half equals one-half? Raise your hand. Okay. Alright now, who says that one-half maybe, sometimes doesn't equal one-half? Okay. So we got a couple. Alright. So, Delphina, what's your thinking? I haven't heard from you. What's your thinking?\u000a I think it depends on what you are looking at.\u000a So, in case you didn't hear her, Delphina said it depends, okay. Hear what she said? It depends on what you're looking at. 'Cause she said with the money example, that you guys, well all of you unanimously, chose half of a hundred, that's $50, as opposed to $5, half of $10. So it does matter. So now we just go back to the question, does one-half equal one-half? Okay, Raul?\u000a I think one-half equals one-half. I think it's still the same. It's not talking about how big it is, it's just talking about a half.\u000a But it didn't say in the question what it was. I think the question is supposed to say what it was  to say if it's the same or not.\u000a Okay, so what Dallas is saying, what Dallas is saying, that it needs to tell you what one-half is. 'Cause she's saying here, the previous question just had the number, one over two, one over two. Equal. Alright, here, she's saying well all of a sudden yeah, the numbers are gone, but you have half of a pizza and a half of a cookie. So now it's not the same.\u000a But it's the same question. What Dallas is saying, in the question it should tell you what is it.\u000a It's actually like 10 fives ... five-tenths and and one-half.\u000a So what do you think? What's your final thought as far as one-half equals one-half? What's your final thought?\u000a They're still the same, it's a half.\u000a It's still the same ...\u000a because it's half.\u000a Okay.\u000a It's the same and different.\u000a It's the same and different. Miguel.\u000a  and they tell you it's different.\u000a Okay, so, good question. Good question. I like the look of that. Yes.\u000a If they are, are they the same? They're the same, it's one-half or something. One is bigger than the other one.\u000a Okay. Rodrigo. What about you, bud? What's your thoughts on this?\u000a I'm still thinking.\u000a You're still thinking? Or are you still, will you compete?\u000a I'm still basically undecided.\u000a Okay.  You think they're basically the same? So, you added that 'basically'. Why don't you just put they're the same? Why did you put 'basically'?\u000a Because one's bigger than the other.\u000a It will obviously still be different. Where we're going with this is, you have to understand that it depends on what your unit is. Your whole unit. Okay? Alright? So that's why sometimes you have to be careful, what it's asking you to do. Okay? Let's go on to the next one. Okay, so what does one-half look like to you? So just think right now in your head, when you think of one-half, okay? What do you see?\u000a Half a dollar.\u000a Half of a dollar.\u000a Half a fifty.\u000a Half a fifty.\u000a Half a gallon of juice.\u000a Half a gallon of juice.\u000a Half a body.\u000a Half of a body. Half of a cake.\u000a Half of a cake. Okay, Guadalupe, what do you see?\u000a Half a paper.\u000a Half a paper, okay. So let me take it to the next step. So what if we said the half a paper times half of a juice. Does it make sense?\u000a No.\u000a Does it make sense?\u000a No!\u000a It doesn't make sense. So we have to make sure that we know what?\u000a You have to make sense.\u000a Well, it makes sense, but how is it gonna make sense? It's what?\u000a If they're the same.\u000a If they're the same. But what's the same?\u000a The object!\u000a The object, or the whole unit, right? Like, what is it we're talking about? We talking about pizza? We talking about cookies?\u000a Paper.\u000a Paper. Juice.\u000a People.\u000a People.\u000a Eggs.\u000a Alright, so the other thing I wanna talk to you about is, does multiplication always make things larger? Bigger?\u000a Yes!\u000a No!\u000a So I heard yes, yes, yes and then ...\u000a No.\u000a So now then, what?\u000a 'Cause sometimes it makes it smaller. If you do nine times one, it's gonna be nine and if you do nine times zero, it makes it zero.\u000a Jessie. Did you hear her example?\u000a No.\u000a Okay, so what she said was, 'cause it's important. I want you to make sure you understood. She said that no, because nine times one is nine. Then when you go nine times zero, it's zero. So it actually made it less, right? What do you think though? When you multiply in general, when you multiply, does it make things larger? When you multiply two things together?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay. Abraham\u000a It gets bigger, because like six times two, it's 12, and it gets bigger.\u000a Okay.  Raul, what do you think? Raul V. When you multiply, does it always get bigger?\u000a It depends on the number.\u000a What?\u000a It depends on the number.\u000a It depends on the number so give me an example.\u000a Zero times 8100, is gonna be zero.\u000a Okay. So can we ... so I'm hearing kind of like, a lot of you are saying yes, it makes it larger. But there's still like some of you who are like saying maybe not always. Like if we go back to, if we go back to that one-half, if we go back to that one-half and that dollar. Gino, what's 100 times one-half?\u000a Times one-half is ... a hundred and a half?\u000a A hundred and a half?\u000a 50?\u000a 50. I got 150.\u000a 150? Taylor, do you agree? One hundred times one-half is 150? Raul B.\u000a 500?\u000a Five hundred? How'd you get five hundred?\u000a I thought it was half of a thousand.\u000a A hundred though. No more thousand, one hundred. One hundred times one-half.\u000a Is it 110? Half of 10 is five.  Half of 10 is five.\u000a So what is your answer? The one hundred times one-half?\u000a Five hundred.\u000a Five hundred? Okay, so one hundred times one-half is five hundred? Tina?\u000a We don't know because we don't know what one-half equals.\u000a Okay, so Tina's saying now, you don't know what the one-half is. What if we're just talking about numbers? One hundred times one-half, what would that be? One hundred times one-half.  Let's say it's money. A hundred dollars times one-half. \u000a It could be five or 50. If we're talking about $100, then it's gonna be one-half of $100 is 35.\u000a Okay, so,\u000a 45. there was a lot of people talking, so you couldn't hear, but Louis is saying it depends, but if you're talking about money, if it was hundred dollars times one-half, it'd be half of $100, which is $50. Let's take that example. One hundred times one-half is 50. So then when we multiply that, did it get larger?\u000a No.\u000a Yeah.\u000a It got smaller. Didn't it? You start with a hundred, and you multiply and you got 50, which is less. So what do you think now? Do you think it always makes things bigger?\u000a No.\u000a Sometimes it makes it smaller.\u000a So, let's ... can you give me another example then? That's just ... make sure we prove it. Is there another example you can give me that makes it smaller then?\u000a Like five times four?\u000a Five times four? We start with five times four, you get what?\u000a 20. It's a bigger number.\u000a Okay, so that's if you multiply it times a half, right?\u000a Ten times one-half?\u000a Ten times one-half would be?\u000a Five.\u000a Raise your hand if you think it doesn't always make it bigger. It depends on what you multiply it by. Alright. Very good. So, we're gonna use the area model to show one-half times one-half.\u000a That's a whole.\u000a One-half times one-half Abraham says it's a whole, but let's go ahead and ... let's take a look. I'm gonna go ahead and shade in one-half, okay. And then we'll take a look to see what it actually equals. Here's a half. There's a half. How many squares are shaded both colors?\u000a One.\u000a Two.\u000a One out of how many total?\u000a Four.\u000a One-fourth. So, one-half times one-half is one-fourth. Is one fourth smaller than one-half?\u000a Yes.\u000a That's another proof that when you multiply, it doesn't always get bigger.\u000a You could make it into money. Like one-fourth is 25 cents.\u000a Alright, very good.\u000a A hundred divided by...\u000a So, let's take a look at another example. If we're to use an area models for this, what would that look like?\u000a Three-fourth. It'd be one-half, right? We'd see one-half times one-fourth. So what do you think?\u000a Half of a fourth? One-eighth?\u000a Half of a fourth, which is one eighth, he said. One-half of one-fourth is one-eighth, do you agree?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay.\u000a

And let's see, I have one, uh, leave it there please, Eulet.\u000a Christmas!\u000a Two...\u000a Christmas!\u000a Uh, it's a little bit like Christmas, you're right. Three! Oh, I have three strings to put beads on, but I have six friends.  But I, you know, I don't. I have some beads, but I don't have any more strings. What could we do?\u000a Your colors...\u000a I think, I think, I think we could have \u000a You think what, what do you think we could do?\u000a I don't know.\u000a Okay. Alright, does anybody have an idea? We have a problem! We have more friends than we have strings.\u000a I want to have that one.\u000a Okay, well we're talking about what we're going to do. Alex, do you know what we could do?\u000a I don't know.\u000a You don't know? Surafel, wait just a minute, 'cause I want everybody to help string beads.\u000a Me and me and me and me are gonna share.\u000a Oh! What did you say?!\u000a We're going to share!\u000a You're gonna share?! Give me a high five for that great solution! Did you hear, she said she's going to share. Who are you gonna share with?\u000a I share a toy!\u000a I'm going to share, I'm going to share with, I'm going to share with...\u000a Did you forget his name?\u000a Um, Eulet.\u000a With Ulet! You're gonna share with Eulet! That's a great idea! Are you going to share?\u000a Not a toy\u000a What about you, what could you do? Could you share?\u000a Yes.\u000a And take some turns?\u000a Yes.\u000a Who can you take turns with? And what's her name?\u000a Brianna.\u000a Brianna. Ask her, Brianna, will you string beads with me?\u000a Will you string beads with me?\u000a Look, can you play?\u000a Yes.\u000a Yeah? Yeah, you can? Good, you can take turns and share and string beads. Surafel!\u000a Huh?\u000a Can you you take turns with someone?\u000a Umm...\u000a Oh! Look at that! Yeah! This is Alex! You're going to take turns with Alex alright? Well what do we need now?\u000a We need some more beads!\u000a We need some more beads. Alright, well I have some beads, let's see... I have some beads. Oh boy, I've got some great colors! Let me show you what we're gonna do, okay? Let's see, whoops, whoops! Hold on a minute. Okay, Lily is gonna have yellow and Eulet is gonna have...\u000a Blue!\u000a Purple, okay, who's gonna go first?\u000a Me.\u000a Alright, Eulet.\u000a And I'll go next!\u000a And you'll go next. Let's see what happens with the colors when you take turns.  Alright, let's see. Eulet is... Surafel sit down, watch. Whoops! Here, pull it this way. Alright, Eulet put his on, now who's turn is it?\u000a My turn!\u000a My turn!\u000a Who's turn is it?\u000a Me.\u000a This is Lily's, Lily's turn! Okay, so look, Lily's having a turn. Alex, watch.\u000a Alex! You...\u000a Okay, but we're not gonna stack. Alright, Lily put hers on, now what do we do?\u000a Eulet.\u000a Back to Eulet, that's right! Eulet, you can say, now it's my turn!\u000a Now it's my turn.\u000a Can you put one on? Surafel, are you watching? They're putting beads on their string!\u000a That's nice to share!\u000a It is! It's nice to share and to take turns.\u000a Just like I share toys!\u000a You share toys?\u000a And we share animals! \u000a Tell her it's your turn.\u000a My turn.\u000a I share toys with my sister.\u000a Oh that's nice!\u000a And I share animals with my sister!\u000a And you share animals? Alright Lily, may I show your friends what you and Eulet did? Look! Look at their colors! When you take turns, look, you make a pattern! You go purple, yellow, purple, yellow! Because you're taking turns, the colors change each time. That's called a pattern.\u000a Yeah!\u000a Alright, so, it's the purple turn now. Eulet, that means it's your turn. Nice working together! I'm going to give Brianna blue, and Natalie red. Okay? Here you go. Let's see if you guys can take turns. Oh, and look! Alex gets blue and Surafel, what color do you get?\u000a Blue.\u000a Orange.\u000a Oh.\u000a Orange, let's see, here. Alright, remember, uh oh!\u000a Lily's turn.\u000a Look Brianna, look Brianna, this was your turn. Now tell Natalie, say Natalie, your turn! Surafel, did you get one on? You did! So now who's turn?\u000a Umm... Remember, we're taking turns. Say, Alex! Give him this part. Say, put yours on! Alright! Here, we're gonna leave this on. Wait for Alex! Oh good! Now it's your turn, Brianna. You have to talk to your friend and tell them when it's their turn. Nice job Eulet and Natalie. Brianna, whoops! You're pulling it the wrong way. Pull it this way so it goes on. Okay, now who's turn?\u000a My turn!\u000a Who's turn?\u000a My turn!\u000a Brianna, look, Natalie said it's her turn. Give it to Natalie. Tell her your turn, and then your turn is next. How are we doin' guys? Uh oh, did they come off? Let me see, let's see. Oh, uh oh. Here, let me come around and see if I can help you. Eulet and Lily, you're working so nicely. Is it your turn again? Alright. Natalie, tell Brianna when it's her turn.  Alright boys, let's see. Let's get you going again, alright? Here, let's put these down. Okay, Alex has blue and Surafel has orange. Surafel, can you put yours on? Okay. Beautiful, okay, now, who's turn is it now?\u000a Now it's my turn.\u000a Who's turn? Do you remember me saying? It's Alex.\u000a Alex!\u000a Alex! Okay. Give it to Alex. Here, Alex, you're going to hold this part and you put your bead on. Whoops! What's here?

We finished!\u000a You finished! Look, you used all of your beads, your trays are empty. Let's hold it up and look at the colors, and the pattern you made. Can you tell me the pattern?\u000a  Purple, yellow... purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow!\u000a Yay! And we know that you took turns because the colors changed every time.\u000a It's clean up time!\u000a You guys did a great job! And you're right, it is, we are finished. We learned how to take turns with a partner, and we put beads on a string and made a color pattern because we took turns. Yes! It was all good and I think  you all get to ring the good job bell! Good job taking turns, Eulet. Good job taking...\u000a

V Um, that one substance, there's no other types of substances laced into the main substance.\u000a  Okay. And what is yours?\u000a A substance that has nothing mixed into it or added to it.\u000a  Okay, so I hear three different things here, okay? I hear, pure means one substance, not mixed with anything else. I hear, pure is something that's not altered or manipulated in any way. And then I hear something's that natural. I want to know what your thoughts are about those three definitions. So do you agree with those three definitions or not? And tell me why. And tell them why.\u000a Well I don't think it's natural because natural is stuff that can be mixtures.\u000a  Can you give me examples of natural things that you think are mixtures?\u000a Um, like trees.\u000a  So what? And you're saying a tree is a mixture because why?\u000a Because it like, has different colors and different like, feels to it.\u000a  Oh, so different colors, and different feels, so like different textures? Is that what you're saying? And why does that mean that it's a mixture?\u000a Cause it's not all the same.\u000a How do you know?\u000a I don't know, I don't.\u000a What do you guys think? Do you agree with her that a tree is something that's natural, but it's a mixture? So and that was your definition, that you got natural.\u000a I would say it's natural. Like, some things are natural, some things aren't natural, I guess, 'cause... Think about like when a diamond forms. It's a natural thing, and it's only that substance.\u000a  Sure, I agree with you with that example. A diamond is a naturally occurring substance that is pure. But for your definition, what I want you guys to think about is a definition that's true all of the time. So, for a tree, I want us to use that example about a tree really quick. 'Cause you're saying it's a mixture, right? So you're saying it's a mixture 'cause you have different colors and different textures. Why is that statement, "different colors" an indication that it's a mixture?\u000a Well it's, like it, .\u000a  Okay. And a difference between substances? What is color an example of? Michelle?\u000a  Characteristic properties?\u000a  Characteristic property, which we know what about characteristic properties?\u000a  It is characteristic to that one substance.\u000a It's characteristic to that one substance. Okay? So would you change your definitions based on what we just talked about?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Okay. So what I want you to do is write down what you guys now agree is the definition of pure on this piece of paper.  Okay. Hey you guys. I know you're discussing it, and I hope that you're kind of arguing against one another and defending your argument for your definitions. Here's what I'm going to have you do. Based on your conversations, it is now your job to write one definition for the word pure on this sheet of paper, that your whole group agrees on. I'll then share all those with the rest of the class to see if we're all on the same page or not. Okay? We already had one discussion where we had three different definitions. My guess is when I read what they write down, they're now going to have an agreement on what a definition is. But, I may be wrong, so let's see. Write your definition. As soon as you have it done, hold it up in the air. Pure substance, same thing. Pure, or pure substance.  Okay, so what do you want to do? What was your definition?\u000a My definition, well, huh?\u000a  What did you write, literally?\u000a First time, the first time?\u000a  Yeah, the first time. What did you write initially?\u000a I wrote that a pure substance is a substance that is like, clean. It's not dirty or anything.\u000a  Good, and then what did you change it to?\u000a A pure substance is a substance that has not been touched.\u000a  Okay, and why did you change your definition to that? Like, what made you? Did it happen because you guys talked about it?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, so what did he say that made you think that you should change it to "something that hasn't been touched?"\u000a He said like, a pure substance is something that naturally comes from the Earth.\u000a  Okay. So, you said it's something that naturally comes from the Earth. So is that what you mean by "not been touched?"\u000a Yeah.\u000a  So it's just natural and not manipulated by people?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  So it could have been literally touched, but...\u000a Unprocessed.\u000a  Unprocessed, okay. So, give me an example of a pure substance that naturally exists.\u000a Um... Tree?\u000a  Okay, so tell my why you think a tree is pure.\u000a It hasn't been really, been really processed or anything, it's in the forest.\u000a  Okay, so then, what do you know about color of substances?\u000a Um... Sometimes it's a characteristic property.\u000a  It is a characteristic property, right? Which means each substance has it's, a certain color. And for that substance it will always be that color. When you think of a tree, do you see one color, or do you see multiple colors?\u000a Sometimes multiple.\u000a  Multiple colors, so what is that evidence of? Multiple colors?\u000a Characteristic property?\u000a  It is a characteristic property, but I mean, how is having... Hey Brett? Can you please focus on what you need to be doing? Do you have your definition done?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  Okay, here's what I would like the rest of you guys to do, including Brett's group. You now, if you have your definition written down, I want you to go ahead and start doing number two. Give me your examples of pure substances. And give me your explanations. I'm going to give five minutes for that. That means 10:38. So... A tree has multiple colors. Green is going to be an indication of, of what? Would you be able to say that green would be an indication of one substance?\u000a Not really.\u000a  No, okay why not?\u000a Because, leaves or grass. Bark is a tree.\u000a Okay, so you're saying that more than, there's more than one substance maybe that can be green. Okay? But, okay, so that's fine. If there are different colors of green, do you think that means different substances? No? What about characteristic properties though? What do you know about a characteristic property?\u000a It never changes for a substance.\u000a  It never changes for a substance. So if I have two different greens, do you think I have two different substances?\u000a No.\u000a I would. 'Cause that's the definition of a characteristic property. Right, one green would be characteristic for that one substance, always. Never, ever something different. If I see a different color, that must mean I have a different substance. Okay? If I have two substances together, do you think that's a mixture or pure?\u000a  Mixture.\u000a Mixture. So, a tree. Do you see multiple colors on a tree?\u000a Yeah.\u000a What does that indicate?\u000a A mixture.\u000a A mixture of multiple substances. Is a tree natural?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah, so does that affect your definition for pure? If you're saying it's a mixture, it can't be pure, but it's natural, so maybe our definition needs adjustment? So think about what you might change your definition to be now, okay? Okay, and write one down .  Are you done with this problem?   It's anonymous. Okay, well then--\u000a  Water isn't, is it?\u000a  Oh, interesting, so you guys, you don't know if water is or isn't.\u000a You explained on the board that one time that it was a mixture of oxygen and... Something else.\u000a  Okay, so let's... Okay, well what's the chemical formula for water?\u000a  H two O.\u000a H two O, so, what elements are combined to make water? Hydrogen and oxygen, okay? So I agree with you there, hydrogen and oxygen are bonded together, which makes water, okay? So do you think water is pure or a mixture?\u000a  Well, when they do the water definition, we were trying to decide like, if something's straight, like we could some  not a mixture .\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Then is it pure? Okay, I'm going to read your definition really quick, okay? So a pure substance is a raw substance. Nothing inside of a pure substance has been changed or added, it came straight from nature. There is no trace of any other substance. It is not a mixture. Okay, I see two definitions in there. Here's what I see. I see a definition that talks about it being, I see three. One, your definition is, "something that "comes from nature." Another one I see is, "Something that "has not been changed." Another one I see is, "no trace of another substance." So that sounds like one substance. Okay, those are the three definitions I see.\u000a  But is there a substance from nature that hasn't been changed?\u000a  No.\u000a  Water is a substance from nature that hasn't been changed. I mean, yeah, we add things to it.\u000a It hasn't been changed, but it is a mixture.\u000a  Is it a mixture though?\u000a Yeah.\u000a But what about when like, animal live in it and stuff, does it change?\u000a  So you're kind of thinking maybe it gets contaminated that way? If it gets in contact with something else?\u000a Yeah, if they're even from nature .\u000a  So here's what, today, we should be able to figure out by the end of the period. And you guys pretty confidently should be able to tell me if water is or is not pure. Here is my hint. My hint to you, is the way we can tell by looking at something, if it's pure or a mixture, 'cause you can, or maybe not just by looking, but experimenting with it. It's based on characteristic properties of matter. That's what I want you to think about.\u000a So, it's just the primary colors, then?\u000a  What do you mean?\u000a  Primary colors?\u000a Well, the primary colors, I don't know. It's just that color .\u000a  So is color a characteristic property of matter? Yes. What does that mean then?\u000a  Wait, but can't you change it? When something's a color? But when you add one color to... Something . Like if I add a color to the water, doesn't it change the water?\u000a  When you add a color into water, it mixes with the water.\u000a So it's not still water?\u000a It still tastes like water?\u000a  I didn't say that. I just said it was mixed.\u000a  It's a mixture, oh.\u000a Okay, I didn't say that either, but,\u000a  If you put the food coloring in it...\u000a So, and why are you saying that's all of a sudden a mixture? Because they're .\u000a  So different substances together, okay. So what then does "pure" mean?\u000a Not mixed, a substance by itself.\u000a  A substance by itself. So you believe water is just a substance. Okay? Alright. Alright you guys! These crutches are going to kill me. Are you okay? Those hurt, you're hurt. Okay, you're okay.  We're going to talk about it right now, okay? Do I have everybody's piece of paper? Are you done? Okay.  This is not true.\u000a  Really?\u000a  Yes. Alright, turn here and stop what you're doing. Listen to what? What I want, I know that you may not be done with your examples yet. Because you're still struggling with your definition of pure. I want to show you what other groups are thinking. So I'm going to show you all these. I'll ready them for you too so that, you're going to see that we have differences. And the idea is, by the end of today, based on what we do, you should be able to change and finalize your definition. Okay? And competently be able to give me examples. Alright? So, the first one, and I'll try to move this. Let's make sure you can see this. If it's hard to see Tim, will you turn off, actually why don't you go ahead and do that now Tim? I think it will be better. I don't know. But just the front set of lights? Thank you. We'll come down. Okay. The first definition. "An unprocessed material which is one "substance by itself, instead of combining "multiple substances to get the material." I see two different definitions. I see one, "pure means to be unprocessed," and then I see another, "one substance by itself." Okay? Here's another one. "A pure substance is only one substance "that is not a mixture." So you're starting to see that pure and mixture, which I will agree with, are basically opposites of one another. So you've got to explain the difference between them. So a pure substance is one substance that is not a mixture. So I'm wondering what your definition of mixture is. Who wrote, does anyone? Who wrote this one, are you willing to share? Do you have a definition for mixture then?\u000a  Um well, multiple substances that are mixed together.\u000a  Good so, you're saying, so great, your definition for pure is one substance, while mixture would be more than one substance. Okay. This one says "a substance that has no mixture involved." So you're saying that there's a clear difference between the two. I still don't quite see a definition for the word "pure" yet in this definition. "A pure substance is a substance with "no other substances mixed in." "It is one single substance." So I'm starting to see a little bit of a trend. "A pure substance is a raw substance." "Nothing inside of a pure substance has been "changed or added." "It came straight from nature." "There's no trace of any other substance." "It is not a mixture." So, we definitely have agreement that mixture and pure are something different, but I see three definitions. One, it's something that is raw, or something that, and I think this is what this is saying. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you mean by "raw," kind of, in some way connected to natural. Okay, so, something that is natural versus something that has no trace of any other. So I kind of see the idea of one substance versus multiple. Okay, as a definition. Okay, maybe I only saw two. Okay. Oh I thought this one was typed. I was like, "How did that happen?" How did... Was that you, is that your handwriting? That's insane. Okay, I like it. It's like, prefect.\u000a  Woah.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  There you go.\u000a  Alright. "A pure substance is a substance or material "that hasn't been mixed with any other substance." "It is only one substance." Okay, um. Two.  Two more. "A substance is only one substance, "and it is not mixed with any other substance," right? And our last one. Oh, this one's actually different. "A pure substance is an element." Okay that's a different definition than the other things I've heard. "They are made up of one atom." "They are not mixed with other substances "nor do they contain other substances within them." So I hear two definitions in here. One, being pure means that it's just an element. And then I see another one that it's a single substance. Okay? So I want to hear some of the examples you're coming up with right now. And I'm not going to say if they're right or wrong, I'm just going to try to probe you with some questions. Okay? Naud! What is one of your examples?\u000a  Salt.\u000a  Okay, so you say salt is pure. Why do you say salt is pure?\u000a Because we don't think any other substance is combined with salt to make salt.\u000a  So you're saying that to be pure means one thing, one thing in that container, and you're saying if it's just salt, that must be pure?\u000a  Mm hmm.\u000a  Okay. Miriam.\u000a  It has to be raw and like, like, plain, like raw salt. Like, not like mixed with preservatives or...\u000a  Okay, so literally just salt, that's it.\u000a  Yea.\u000a Okay. Alright, so let's take another example. Or if you disagree with them, you can also offer up your argument for that. Shaina, what do you think?\u000a, Well, we all thought that a diamond might be a pure substance.\u000a  Why?\u000a Well, I think a diamond can only be cut by itself, and can only be cut with a different diamond.\u000a  OK.\u000a So that's really dense, so we thought that if anything was added to it, something else would be able to cut it. And that would be something else that was less dense.\u000a So, interesting. What is, um ... You're talking about density. What is density?\u000a It's a characteristic property.\u000a A characteristic property. So this is good. You definitely should be starting to lean towards what you know about characteristic properties of matter. Okay? That is key to helping you understand the difference between pure and mixture. Who can tell me what a characteristic property of matter is? Hannah?\u000a A property that stays the same regardless of the amount of the substance.\u000a Yeah, a property that stays the same for a substance regardless of the amount. So what I'm hearing you say, is that you think the ability to cut into a diamond has to do with its density. And you're saying that because you can only cut a diamond with a diamond, it must mean that the densities are the same. And so, since the density is the same for the whole diamond, that means it's one substance.\u000a

V Alright. I heard the term velocity. So, I think that sounds pretty good.  Velocity of a skateboarder, the more important you're going to have. I like velocity. Keep talking amongst yourselves. I'm just kind of here to guide you along. Make sure the people here, I don't want anyone to have their back to each other. I know the room is difficult to do that, but if you guys could try to make sure you look at everyone inside of the group. I know it's difficult.\u000a Wait. The whole class?\u000a Oh, yeah. I want the whole class to discuss this.\u000a I thought you were doing like table and table? No, no, no. I want everyone to talk. Sorry.\u000a Okay.\u000a You guys can talk, just like I talk across the room. Feel free to do so. \u000a  So, someone, when we ask their velocity.\u000a  You need more length to the tracks.\u000a  Steeper.\u000a  You don't have to raise your hand. If you're looking in that person's eye, or you're looking in my eye, feel free to....\u000a  You need a longer track.\u000a  Distance. \u000a Is it the friction? \u000a  I will tell you that we're not going to look at friction as part of the system. \u000a Let's look back at that proposal for one second. Just want to make sure I didn't miss anything.  It's always good to look at what they give us.  Let's see. What science terms are in there?\u000a  Quantitative. Qualitative.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Energy.\u000a  Oh. We got energy in there.\u000a  Energy transfer.\u000a  Oh, energy transfer. Okay. So, I think they want something to do with energy.\u000a It said quantitative. We should probably use the formulas for kinetic and potential energy, right?\u000a  Do we have them?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  We do?\u000a It's half mv squared, right? And then... \u000a What Christina said, we're going to be collecting data, quantitative, we'll probably have to use some formula that associates with this.\u000a I agree.\u000a Okay.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  He gave us the formula. \u000a E sub k 1/2 mv squared. Energy due to the gravitational field, E sub g mg. Alright. Let's make sure we know what each of these letters stands for. M, mass and the unit. Kilogram. G? \u000a Acceleration due to gravity.\u000a Lauren said force of gravity.  Okay. You want me to write that in? Which one is it?  Oh, its the effect from the gravitational field. Okay, that's fine. You will sometimes see textbooks that read gravitational force, but what are the units for this?  Meters per second squared. So, that can be kind of confusing, if they're calling it gravitational force, and then they're saying meters per second squared because what do you think when you see those units?\u000a Acceleration.\u000a  Acceleration, right. So, I'm going to put acceleration due to gravity. Okay. Good.\u000a  H is height.\u000a  Yeah, h is height. And that's in? \u000a Meters. Sounds good. Okay. So, now we go over here. Mass and kilograms and then, velocity, and that's in meters per second. Good. And then, if you remember that force doesn't like careless errors, so, maybe we should make sure that we get from these fundamental units the derived units. So, what are the units that we're going to have for E sub g and E sub k?  What is it?\u000a  Joules.\u000a Joules. Oh, that's right. How do you remember that?\u000a  I'm smart.\u000a Okay. That's good, too.  \u000a Oh, there was a pretest that had that on there. That sounds good. \u000a Okay. Great. You're taking that prior knowledge.\u000a  Energy is a jewel.\u000a Energy is a precious jewel. Alright. You want precious? Okay, there's jewels. There's semi-precious and there's precious. What are they, diamonds and rubies? So, energy is a precious jewel. Kilogram times a meter per second squared.\u000a  Newton.\u000a  Newton. Good. Newton times a meter?\u000a A joule?\u000a A joule. Right. Over here, mass and kilograms. Kilogram times meters squared over seconds squared, don't forget the square. Kilograms times a meter, again is a newton. Newton times a meter, that's going to be kilogram times a meter over seconds squared is a newton and then, multiply that by that meter, and, again, you get joules. Okay. We want to make sure that we don't, did everyone see how we got that joule there? \u000a Meter times another meter, right?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Because kilogram times a meter per seconds squared gives me a newton. Times a meter, remember this is meters squared, because of that.\u000a Oh, okay.\u000a Okay. So, you know the boss doesn't like careless errors, so let's make sure that we have the appropriate units. Okay. I don't mean to interrupt you guys. Why don't you continue with that? You've got some formulas here now.\u000a For potential energy, wouldn't mass and acceleration due to gravity be constants, so height is the only one that that could manipulate. So, if the height is the greater distance from the Earth then it would have more potential energy because they're directly proportional. \u000a  Yes.\u000a Let me ask you guys... I can't help but interrupt once in a while, right? But, I just wanted to... If I put this marker on the table, does this marker have potential energy?\u000a What is the reference point?\u000a Oh, oh, oh. The table.\u000a No.\u000a The center of our planet.\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay. So, I heard a fight, I think that's a good thing. \u000a The more danger, the more fun I thought, right?\u000a Yes.\u000a They're going to wear their headgear. Is this guy wearing any head, oh he's wearing head protection.  Why is that important, by the way?\u000a So, the force doesn't apply to your head... \u000a Okay, I like that. \u000a Ah. Inversely proportional, right? I like that, yeah. So, it increases the amount of time, decreases the force. So, yeah, danger is an aspect here, but this guy seems like he's doing okay. He's got his headgear on, but, that's definitely, if you're designing a park, you want to make sure that the people that visit the park aren't going to be injured. There are going to be accidents with skateboards but they'll wear their gear. I'm going to step back and let you guys continue your thought earlier.\u000a  Okay. So, how high do we want the...\u000a If we want it to have a bigger potential energy, transferring the bigger kinetic energy, we might want to have the height from the reference point, which is the ground and kind of higher.\u000a  I heard reference point. Let me see if I can put a reference point on this.  I did just put a little, click a button and get the reference point, okay?\u000a  I think the thing should be on the ground. \u000a  Yeah.\u000a The weight's, like it's safer and it's possible. \u000a Do you want me to just to extend the...  We've got a couple of things going on here. I'm sorry. A couple people said yes, they wanted me to put that on the ground? So, if those people could say that again, that would be great. Say that again?  You want to put it on the ground. And, I think I heard a dissenting voice in the crowd. Someone that said something else?\u000a  I did.\u000a Oh, okay.\u000a  I said that if you increase the height, it's still possible to have it above the ground because you would have two supports on either side, technically, you'd be able to go back and forth. \u000a  They haven't brought in the supports for this herculean innovation. That's right. I mean, I don't think it really is going to affect the design structure, so...\u000a Whether it's on the ground or...\u000a  I'll just pull that down. That's fine.  Yeah, I don't think that's going to make a difference. That might make it easier for the person to step off the track, too, when they're done. You know, this guy's going to get really tired. There's no friction, so he won't have to step off on the nice safe track.\u000a But, you notice how as long as the track is longer he doesn't go back up as high, so if you have... \u000a  Alright. One at a time. I like this. Someone said something. Christina said something, and I think Karuna wanted to add to that.\u000a He goes just as high...  like there's no change because there's no friction. So...\u000a Yeah, then he doesn't go up to the top.  \u000a  I could put the pie chart in, sure.\u000a And, can you start him at the top? \u000a  Alright. So, I'm going to put the pie chart in and then you want me to, he's going to climb up the ladder, right? There's like, a pretend ladder here. And then, how's that?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay. Now, I noticed when I did that, something happened.\u000a The pie chart. \u000a Oh, yeah. Why?  Sounds like a height there that's increasing, reference point is greater, I like that. Okay, I'm going to let him go.  I don't know if I can do that, actually, but I will try. Yeah, we can play around with it.\u000a  Make the sides taller, then he'll have a greater distance to travel and it'll actually be more.\u000a  I don't know if I can, yeah, I don't think I can do that. I don't think it'll, it only allows me to click on the blue dots there.\u000a You have to add track to do that. \u000a You want me to pull those off to the side? Okay.  Okay. So, you made a little bit different half-pipe.  Oh, no! Alright. So, you don't want to, look there's some thermal energy. What's going on with that?  Okay. That might've happened. But why do I now see red in the pie chart?  Yeah. There's a force that will allow for the energy to transfer. Good. Let's get him back on that half-pipe and you know guys, I don't think that it makes much of a difference in the design or engineering of this, whether we make the bottom hit the ground or have it up. So, I don't really think that is going to make much of a difference. But, we do need to collect some data, and start with this proposal, so... Where did we leave off? I think there was something that we were looking to collect there.\u000a  Height.\u000a Okay, good. Let's continue with that, please.\u000a Well, measuring tape.\u000a Oooh! There is a measuring tape. I don't even see these things. Measuring tape, oh. It even says fet, okay good. So, how's that look?\u000a No, no!\u000a  Well, what do you want me to do with it?  Going to the ground.  That's not the ground?\u000a From the reference point.\u000a  Oh, alright. I'm right on the reference point!\u000a Go up a little. \u000a  So, what do you want me to measure?  Well, where am I going to measure? From what to what?\u000a The reference point to the highest point.\u000a  Okay. I think the highest point would probably be the center of him, but they do have that nice, little red dot. Can we just agree that we're going to go with the red dot?\u000a Yes.\u000a  Yeah. Why don't we go there?\u000a It can't be diagonal.\u000a  Okay.  Is that good?\u000a Yeah. \u000a  Yes.  Shut the lights off for this measure. Okay.  Now, this measuring tape is a little tricky to work with. I wonder if there's any easier way for me to get this.  Oh. Oh, that's pretty neat. I suppose I could use a measuring tape or I actually have that, so maybe that will help make it a little bit easier, if it could speed things up. So, what do we want to say for the height?\u000a Seven. \u000a I don't know if I'd say seven.  So, we all agree it's somewhere between six and eight, yes?\u000a Yes. I'd say 7.2.\u000a And it does go over the seven a little bit, so height equals seven point...  Two. Four. Six. Zero.  You tell me or it's going to go forever! Let's start over again. Seven.  I don't think it goes to the half mark.  7.1?  Maybe we need a show of hands on this? Who believes it's 7? Who believes it's 7 meters? No one's raising their hands, that's good. How about 7.1? 7.1 meters? Alright. I got one person there. Now, I'm looking at this from an angle, right? And anytime you want to make a measure, you do want to have your eyes right above what you're measuring and obviously...  I'm just going to move over here, just so I can get, a little bit better. And then what else can I do to try to really measure this well?\u000a  Pause it.\u000a Yeah. I think I'm going to pause the animation. Now, if I was making an actual measurement, I'd make sure my eyes were perpendicular to whatever I was measuring. What do we say about, oh, that's good. What do we say about these measures that we make in science?\u000a  They should be, you're only as good as your measures.\u000a  Yeah. You're only as good as your measures. What does that mean? Kristen?\u000a It means that if your measures are not precise and consistent, then everything else won't be precise and consistent.\u000a  Can someone elaborate on that a little bit? Or do you want to add to that?\u000a No, someone else can elaborate on it.\u000a  Okay. Are you sure? I can give you a little more...\u000a No. \u000a  Okay. Let's see. Who haven't I called on at all today because I want to make sure I get everyone. \u000a You haven't called on Jill.  \u000a  Alright. I'm sure she doesn't mind repeating it for you.  I think you said, you're only as good as your measures. \u000a Because if your measures aren't precise, then all your other work that you're using the measures for...  Yeah, if you measure something for speed...  It would be wrong.\u000a  Why?\u000a Well no, if you...\u000a  It could be, you're right. If you make some poor measures, and then you go to graph it.\u000a No. If you take distance and then multiply it by time, then speed would be wrong. Like, if you had the wrong distance, then speed would be wrong, and then making it after that, your graph would be wrong.\u000a  Well, it would be wrong, right from the perspective, you said, distance times time, and speed is distance divided by time. Did everyone hear that?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  That's okay, though. You're saying, we don't want to get off the main idea here. If you're getting these distances wrong and then you're going to graph, your slope is going to be incorrect, yes? So, remember in science, we collect data. From that data, we put it in a nice data table to organize it and then we look at trends and patterns, graph it, look at trends and patterns. So, if everything starts from our measures, those next steps aren't going to be correct.\u000a

V  Okay, so tell us a little background about Ed.\u000a Alright, well it showed that he had chest pains and also his vital signs showed that his heart was very weak so we thought he was having a heart attack and also he was unconscious.\u000a  Okay, so because of his complaining of chest pains, be subtle from conscious or no?\u000a He called and he talked to the paramedics, but it also said he was obese and so that could contribute to it as well.\u000a  How do you suppose that contributes to having a cardiac condition?\u000a Generally, it can clog your arteries.\u000a  What can clog your arteries?\u000a The fat that builds up.\u000a  Okay, from being obese?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, is that one of the, I guess, physical signs that someone may have a heart condition?\u000a Yes.\u000a  Okay, okay, alright. Go ahead.\u000a It is also his blood pressure. It said it's at variable levels, so that means his heart isn't working properly or consistently. So, that means it could also contribute to a circulatory system, it could damage it. It's also another sign of a heart attack.\u000a  Okay, so the variable heart, or actually the variable blood pressure. And some of you had questions about that when you were doing your research. You were wondering what did this variable mean and I think what you said is exactly right, it's not normal, okay. They state the variable meaning, it wasn't working how it should. Okay, so sounds like this guy had some definite issues both with his vital signs and with his history. So, tell us a little bit why you ranked him number one compared to let's say, you ranked, who was your number, hmm? Who was your second, who proceeded him? Nelson. Nelson, so you got Ed ranked over Nelson where some other people had Nelson ranked number one, so, what do you think?\u000a Well, he's unconscious now so that means his heart attack started some time ago and once you have a heart attack you need treatment immediately, and since his heart attacks aren't his title, he needs it. I think it's important to see, to get treatment.\u000a  To get medical care?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, if he doesn't get treatment what do you think could happen?\u000a Probably, he'll die from the heart attack if he doesn't get treatment or paralyzed.\u000a  What do you mean by paralysis? Why do you think he could become paralyzed?\u000a I'm not sure if it's a stroke or a heart attack if you go through it if you get paralyzed or not.\u000a  Okay, you're not sure if it's a stroke or a heart attack that leads to possible paralysis?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Anybody like to comment on that? Question, go ahead Jordan.\u000a It's a stroke. It has a brain clot and then that will cause partial, I can't say it.\u000a Paralysis.\u000a Yeah that word, but heart attack. You could have a heart attack after that using different parts, not paralysis.\u000a  Good point. So, Jordan says having a stroke can cause paralysis. What system is being affected when you have a stroke that could lead to paralysis? What system in our body is that?\u000a  Nervous system.\u000a  Yeah, nervous system. Okay, understand? Doban, Jake, got that? Alright, so you guys have Ed, you ranked him number one and then you ranked Nelson number two along with quite a few other people. It looks like we have some consistencies there. Let's look at group B. You had Nelson ranked number one, but then you did have Ed ranked number three. So, you didn't think Ed was as serious having this heart condition compared to Nelson and/or Monique?\u000a Well, Nelson and Monique had the most critical vital signs. They seemed the most, the worst, because their temperatures were in the critical zone and above where they started, so they were overheated and they probably had heatstroke or hyperthermic. So, they were not, and they were dehydrated too. When your body starts to dehydrate that's not, it really messes up all your systems. So they were...\u000a  What systems?\u000a Cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, the immune system, everything's just being attacked here because with Eve, let me see this, his heart rate was way below normal and that's the cardiovascular system. His temperature was completely 109 from all the heat from the canyon.\u000a  What's the normal body temperature for that of a human?\u000a The normal temperature is 98.6 and he's at 109.\u000a  He's at 109 folks. Okay, I think this was one of our hypers if you remember, Nelson and Monique were our two hypers that were airlifted into the hospital, okay? So, he's at 109.\u000a Isn't this like the immune system?\u000a  Mmhmm.\u000a Yeah, so that's the immune system and then his breathing rate is way down. It's at 10 respirations per minute.\u000a  10 respirations per minute?\u000a And the normal's like 20, so he's down to half. So, I think that his vital signs were way more out of whack.\u000a  Did you count in on the blood pressure?\u000a The blood pressure?\u000a It's really low and that means his circulatory system's not working right which means blood's not getting everywhere it needs to be. Which means he could end up having, I don't actually know if it would lead to a stroke, but like if everything's not getting blood everywhere, his brain might not get enough blood. He could have brain damage or something like that.\u000a  It's interesting she said stroke, talking about Nelson. Was Nelson having any type of nervous system symptoms?\u000a  Seizures.\u000a  It was seizures.\u000a  He was having seizures. Is that, is a seizure an event that occurs as a result of something going wrong with the nervous system? Absolutely. Think about all the systems you just named. What's going on with Nelson? Cardiac, nervous, circulatory, immune.\u000a Dehydration.\u000a Entire  bringing in dehydration. Digestive, not enough water. This guy is having a rough time, isn't he? So, if you're pretty confident in why you ranked him number one.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Okay, comments? Anybody?\u000a Well, the reason we ranked him three was because we thought that he was most likely going to die and so we thought that his daughter was a higher priority because...\u000a  Monique?\u000a Yeah, because she has a better chance of survival.\u000a  So, you ranked him three, and it's interesting you said, "We thought he was going to die." He was maybe beyond that point of help.\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, so why'd you rank him three? Why not rank him seven?\u000a  Well, what if he has a shot?\u000a  He's got a chance.\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, he has a chance over Mark.\u000a That wound to the chest.\u000a  Yeah, because Mark got shot in the chest, didn't he?\u000a You'd save him though.\u000a  It's interesting you said if he has a shot. Mark's the one that got shot. \u000a He was more stable than Nelson was though. Mark was.\u000a  Mark was more stable?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Interesting, you're bringing in the whole fact of, now you're triaging it. You're saying okay, Mark's a little bit more stable even though he's got this gun shot and they were kind of vague in what they said about the gun shot. We don't know what kind of gun it was.\u000a But I feel like if you rank him a three, he's at such a critical position that it's either you rank him one, because he needs treatment right away or he's going to die.\u000a  Okay, so you're saying, he's got to be one, based upon all the symptoms, based upon his vital signs, the condition that he was brought in. If you're not going to rank him one you might as well just let him die. Is that what you're saying?\u000a Or early on. Like, you can't wait too long, I guess.\u000a You've got to rank him one to three, otherwise.\u000a  So he's like, what group were you?\u000a We're F.\u000a  You're F, so you had him, okay you had him at a two.\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, alright,  so you're saying he's a top three?\u000a Yeah, especially.\u000a  You had a hand up.\u000a Oh, I was just agreeing with him. If we thought we had any chance we should be like let's not waste any time to finish this either that or just make him seven.\u000a  Okay, good point. Brian?\u000a Well, were were thinking...\u000a  Speak up a little bit please.\u000a Well, we were thinking that even though he's unconscious and having seizures he was a crooked patient, but compared to like the other ones like Albert or Mark, his symptoms weren't that of like great danger as the others, and even though his body temperature was 109, that could have been because he was going through heat stroke, but now that he's in Asprins they're a cool environment.\u000a  You bring up heatstroke. Why do you think he's going through a heatstroke?\u000a Well, I don't know, because he was unconscious, and they said he was dehydrated and everything. Well dehydration can be due to heatstroke and like I also figured it'd be heatstroke because his daughter...\u000a  Monique.\u000a Yeah, I'm sorry, Monique, it said that she was dizzy and nauseous and if she was in the same environment as Nelson was, then it's more likely that their symptoms are close to each other because if she's going through like nauseous and like dizziness then it's most likely that he is too because they're both in the same environment.\u000a  Very interesting. I want to come back to this point. Ryan you've got your hand up. What were you going to say?\u000a I was just going to say that Monique has the same symptoms for heatstroke.\u000a  You're exactly right. Now my mind instantly goes somewhere here. Jordan, your hand was up first.\u000a I was just going to say that since their temperature's so high, they're probably in shock and always their temperature is almost basically fatal levels, so just putting them, they're going from a really hot environment to a really cold environment. Or really cool compared to where they were. If they'll put them into more shock which can also be fatal, which means they're not exactly just because they're in a hospital, doesn't mean they're necessarily going to get better right away.\u000a  Okay, obviously they need some treatment. You don't want to go from one extreme to the other, but do you agree that they need to be cooled down quite a bit?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  They need to get cooled down and what else do they need?\u000a Water.\u000a  Water, lots of water, correct? Yes?\u000a You can't really say that Monique's symptoms can apply for Albert too because Monique was having like an allergic reaction to the bee sting. So, that's probably what most of the symptoms are from.\u000a  We forgot about the bee sting. It says she's dizzy, nauseousness, has cracked lips, is having difficulty breathing, has a rash on her legs and stomach. Okay, she got stung by a bee.\u000a Like, you were saying, the reason we put Monique as number one besides experiencing possible heatstroke, we also have her experiencing a very bad allergic reaction to the bee. It shows here that with the difficulty breathing, the bee sting, her body is having a very poor reaction to the bee sting and that if left untreated for longer times without getting pills and stuff like that or EpiPen.\u000a Getting what?\u000a  EpiPen.\u000a  You know what it is?\u000a  Just say EpiPen.\u000a  EpiPen, yeah. Epinephrine.\u000a Epinephrine.\u000a Yes.\u000a It should elevate them in the  largest sense where she could potentially have life threatening without her entire like, respiratory system is closing off, she loses her breathing possibly.\u000a Absolutely, she's having the preliminary signs of an allergic reaction here. Here's where my thought went and I said we'd come back to this point. Maybe Sean, you were going to comment or somebody else. They're both out in the wilderness, this canyon, they're both having heatstroke symptoms. Actually, Monique got stung by the bee, she's having separate issues there. You don't see anything else different about these two individuals? Sean.\u000a One got to stay put for a long period of time and assured a maybe cooler spot while the other still had to keep going up through the sun and the heat to try to get to the top.\u000a  Do you think that would have a difference in their physical?\u000a One gets to rest while the other still has to keep going and going and going another what, third of the way.\u000a  Excellent point, you know. What's the other issue between these two? Jack, you know?\u000a Well like, they're both in the same environment and they both have symptoms of heatstroke, but Monique got stung by a bee and at the same time Nelson has no signs of any external trauma or anything that happened to him that caused the symptoms. So, it could have even been a seizure or a stroke made him lose consciousness and causes a temperature to rise so high is because he was probably thinking that there was something off.\u000a  Interesting, interesting. Yes?\u000a Would it be their age?\u000a  Age, excellent. Look at the difference in their age. How old's Monique?\u000a 18.\u000a Yeah, she's 18. Nelson, the dad right? He's 51. I'm not saying 51 is old, but there's a big difference between 18 and 51, plus the fact you add in what Sean said, he's got to hike out of this canyon, he's going to try to find help, right? Is he having to expend a lot more energy?\u000a Yeah.\u000a And he's got to go uphill.\u000a He's go to go uphill, yeah. It's hot, he's got no water, he's got to go uphill, he's losing, basically, control of his body. No energy, no water. Erin?\u000a And that's why we had Nelson as number one and then Monique would go second because they both had like the heat problem, but Nelson was having, it was much more severe with him because of his age and everything. And Monique, she was sitting there for three hours after being stung by a bee, so it wasn't like, so we put her close up to the top because there was, she's already been waiting for long enough. She needs to get help like right away because she was sitting in the shade waiting for hours while her dad had to go struggle up the top of the canyon. So, they were in a really bad situation and they just needed help immediately because they'd been struggling long enough.\u000a  Absolutely. What?\u000a During our discussion we were kind of using...\u000a  Speak up a little bit, sorry.\u000a Okay so, during when we were discussing the age, we were thinking also Monique but...\u000a  Which group were you real quick?\u000a E.\u000a  You were E, okay.\u000a So, like what we thought was that since Monique is 18 years old, verses Nelson is a 51 year old, well like, it makes sense that Monique has a stronger immune system because she's more young and she has more nutrients in her body whereas Nelson could be different, but we don't know if he has any diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure. It doesn't show, but I'm just saying in general. We were writing specific about his other health because I wrote that down.\u000a  Age related diseases.\u000a  Age related diseases, yeah. So, we're missing some medical history.\u000a Yeah, so it's possible there because he's older and because his immune system isn't as strong as Monique's is, we have to like, or doctors have to like protect them with treatment more early because his immune system is much more weak compared to his daughter's.\u000a  Absolutely. As doctors, medical history is so important. It's so important in the triage process and we've been through this folks. You know, you go to the doctor's office, you go into the hospital, you know, in addition to while they're taking your vital signs, what are they asking? What are they asking when you go in?\u000a Medical history.\u000a  Oswell?\u000a Have you had any previous stuff?\u000a  What's stuff mean?\u000a Like surgery, so like problems.\u000a  Okay, other medical conditions.\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay, what's another question they ask? Very simple.\u000a  Has it ever happened before?\u000a  Has it happened before?\u000a  Is it hereditary?\u000a  Could it be hereditary, what's your family's history? And I think that's what Brian, you were relating to back there. What are you here for today? Okay, let's look back in the chart, should I?\u000a At this moment when he comes into the hospital, he's obviously not having symptoms of having high blood pressure in the past and high blood pressure might have actually helped.\u000a  Oh, so you're asking about, you're referring to Nelson?\u000a Yeah, because if he had high blood pressure then that might have actually helped keep his blood pressure up to normal if it went down severely because of what happened in the canyon. But because it's so low, I would guess that he doesn't have a history of high blood pressure.\u000a  Okay, you might want to disagree with that and take history out of it. Blood pressure is obviously low. I think we addressed this a second ago. Why do you think it's low? Sarah?\u000a Because everything else that's going on, it's also affecting blood pressure.\u000a  Yeah, I think, I truly believe with the limited amount of information we have, I truly believe that because of the dehydration, the heatstroke, the no energy, no nutrients, I literally think this entire body, all the systems...\u000a  Shutting down? Shutting down. I really do think that. But it's a good point that you bring up because his blood pressure's 85 over 50. Does anybody, has anybody ever taken their blood pressure before? Okay, 85 over 50, that's low. I mean that gets to borderline point where, you know, you're dizzy, I mean you could have an episode because that pressure of your blood going through the circulatory system, it's not high enough. I mean that gets borderline, with instead of having to take medicines for high blood pressure, you got to take medicines to bring your blood pressure up. I think his body's just shutting down and you bring up a good point, but I think in this case just with everything else going on, I think his body's just shutting down. Okay.\u000a Honestly on the side of that, besides you were saying like high blood pressure could actually help. During the scenario that he's in, high blood pressure like with it's problems that it could cause with it's possible weakens the heart, could have actually killed him during the long, extended time of trying to get to the paramedics. That was due to the fact that the high blood pressure has the  of hurting muscles at a much different rate than most people. That this test could have possibly failed during the time to get to a paramedic without . And plus even had he survived the high blood pressure and got on the top, the shut down of major systems in his body would have still caused the blood pressure to get down so that there's no possible low levels that could even cause problems.\u000a True, yeah Blythe?\u000a Like on the graphs, I feel like there's Nelson, his blood pressure and the blood pressure of Elders was like similar because it was 80 over 50 whereas Nelson was 85 over 50. But we just talked about how like, Nelson's blood pressure could be low and this other instance it might not be, but with Elder he has a head injury and...\u000a

V  Yes, I think if it's really, really quiet, and you want to talk about something, then, go ahead. But if a lot of people obviously want to talk, probably a good idea to raise our hands. Okay, what else?\u000a  Be involved?\u000a Be involved, yes. I will be keeping track of who contributes to the discussion. Because everybody has an opinion, but I need you to express that opinion. What else?\u000a  Don't criticize other peoples' ideas.\u000a Don't criticize other peoples' ideas. Okay? What might you do instead?  Suggest something, give your outlook, give your opinion. Okay. Give your argument. But don't insult the other person's ideas. This is a safe place to share ideas, okay? Now we're going to have three jobs. I'm going to need a task master, a reader, and a time-keeper.\u000a  Time-keeper!\u000a You want to be the time-keeper? Alright, you need to let us know when we've got about two minutes left of the class.\u000a  I want to be the task master.\u000a  Okay, so what does the task master do?\u000a  They make sure that everybody's on task.\u000a  Yeah, what else? What might that look like?\u000a  Subjects get off, or out of control.\u000a  So, people get off subject, we could, a little bit of crowd control. What about if everybody wants to talk and they start raising their hands?\u000a  You get to pick on one.\u000a  Yeah, task master gets to call and make sure every body gets their chance to talk. Okay? Yes?\u000a  Is there a praiser?\u000a  Actually, that's a good idea. Let's have a praiser.\u000a  I want to be him.\u000a  You want to be the praiser? Alright, Michael is the praiser. What's the praiser do?\u000a  Oh, can I do that? \u000a  Dang it, always.\u000a  You can team up with me.\u000a  Can we?\u000a  This class, yeah, you guys want to be a team? Okay. So, what is a praiser? What are you guys going to do?\u000a  Give compliments.\u000a  Okay, give compliments. Compliment their ideas, their expressions, okay? And then I need a reader. Preferably somebody on that side of the room.\u000a  I don't know how to read. I'm unavailable.\u000a  You'll read?\u000a  No.\u000a  Who would like to read? \u000a  About five seconds before I call on someone.\u000a  I'll do it.\u000a  Okay so, the questions are all up here, there's five of them. You're going to read them so the whole group can hear.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Okay? Alright, so, task master...\u000a  Oh, I'm here.\u000a  Okay, you're on task now, and we're going to start by having the reader read us the first question.\u000a  Okay, should people own ideas? \u000a  I don't really think so, I think it should be shared, like for public opinion. Like, public knowledge, like how they were putting the genome stuff out on the internet.\u000a  Great thought.\u000a  Thanks.\u000a  You're doing good.\u000a  Well, I think that the information should be shared, but the people who found it or came up with the idea should get credit for it.\u000a  I think that if you come up with an idea, shouldn't you have some like, you have conferences, everybody gets together and talks about stuff. So, why don't you have scientists and stuff, that like created this idea, come together and have a conference and talk about it, so then ideas are spread out through all those companies and stuff. And then the people that made, that contributed to it, have like a patent, I guess you would say, or just like, copy, or not copyright it.\u000a  Like discovered by, or?\u000a  Yeah, like that.\u000a  Good opinion.\u000a  So, coming together would be easier then.\u000a  Sometimes I feel like, if... If no one gets credited, or gets, yeah.  They won't want to like... They won't want to--\u000a  Put the information out there.\u000a  Yeah, put the information out there. Like they won't have something to, you know...\u000a  Work for?\u000a  Work for! There you go. \u000a  Yeah, because I think that everybody like wants a part of getting like . Because you want that credit, because you put all that effort into it. So, why not get a little bit of credit? That makes it worth it. How do you like that one?\u000a  Okay, second question. Should people own genes?\u000a  No.\u000a  Yes. \u000a  Well, you kind of already own your own genes. I mean you kind of, they're your own. Like any, unless you clone yourself, I mean, nobody else has the exact same stuff.  You could.\u000a  Let me give you an example of an idea of somebody owning a gene. The breast cancer gene that was discussed in the video, which is actually a lack thereof, of a particular part of a gene, that is patented by a particular company. Which means they found it, they spent money to find it, so they own the patent on it. If you are a person, you don't have to be female just to look for this, but if you are a person who would like to go look for that gene, you have to pay a patent fee to that company because they found it. That's what it means to own a gene.\u000a  I think owning a gene is just having a company that has a lot of money, that can be like, "Oh I'm going to put a patent on that, "so boo-ya, can't take it."\u000a  Yeah I don't think that's right. I mean, if someone, they should like put it open to the public, because I mean if it's a gene like, say breast cancer, they should't just keep that private and make they pay for it.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So, it's sort of like owning a part of a human. If you own a gene by a corporation, it's like owning a part of the person who has that gene, or doesn't have that gene. So... It's sort of a moral issue. Would you want to be owned by a company, just that little tiny part of your DNA? I wouldn't.\u000a  Excellent point.\u000a  You would?\u000a  Good job, Jenna.\u000a  I wouldn't.\u000a  Oh, okay.\u000a  You practically just went against everything we just said. \u000a  Anybody else have any input? \u000a  I agree with Jen.\u000a  Okay, third question. Would you want to know if you carried a gene for cancer?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  No.\u000a  I would not.\u000a  Well, it depends on what age I'm at.\u000a  Because like, then you have that whole impending like, doom your whole entire life, like, "Oh, I'm eventually going to get cancer, "might as well just die."\u000a  That's why I die, \u000a  But if you do know, then you have the chance to actually deal with it.\u000a  You're going to have to deal with it, anyway.\u000a  Yeah, but if you knew, you would have all that time to realize and to put things in order in your life. You would know, you would live life to the fullest, I would. I would live life to the fullest if I knew that I actually had this cancer. I would know and I would do the best I could to live my life without settling.\u000a  Yeah, so the shadow of you, that eventually .\u000a  And that would just push me forward, considering--\u000a  Drive yourself.\u000a  Whatever I do. Yeah. And maybe, just maybe if I knew, I would work to try to cure it myself. So, then I would be helping other people as well. I would want to know.\u000a  Remember that there are no right or wrong answers to these questions. Please feel free to share.\u000a  I think my, what's it called, my opinion, I'd want to know so that, if you didn't know, and you have kids you could be passing it on to them, and wouldn't that hurt you to see that, to have your kids have cancer? Like, I would think that. And then, if like I did, I would want to know, I would, like Jen said, live life to my fullest, and... Because some things, like, if I was, per se white, I would go tanning, wouldn't that hurt your cancer? Because like, radiat-- Well that's what causes it, you know what I mean? I'd just do things differently if I had it.\u000a  Remember what they said in the video, it's often a maybe. It's not a "you will have this," it's a maybe. There are things that they can check for that they can say definitely, you will or will not get, like Huntington's Disease, which is a very devastating disease. Remember how they talked about Tay-Sachs, which kills very early? Huntington's is somewhat similar, but it kills later in life. And starts to show signs mid-30's, and usually death is somewhere in the 40's or 50's, so that's significantly earlier, since life expectancy is in the 70's in this country. So... Would you want to know, yes or no, if you had something like Huntington's, which is definitely a yes or no, but what about in a situation that's a maybe?\u000a  I don't want to know if it's a maybe, because then you live with that fear that you might get it or you might not.\u000a  I would still want to know.\u000a  Yeah, because what if your body starts shutting down like, one night, and you just start twitching in your sleep?  Wouldn't you want to know that's from cancer, rather than your brain's messed up, and drugs or something, I don't know.\u000a  Yeah, I think I'd want to know. I mean like, instead of just not knowing what's causing all this stuff happening in your body. Some think it's because I'm a very curious person.  I'd want to know what's going on.\u000a  I would want to know. Because like Jenna said, like one night you're just having a seizure or something, you could take, like, medicine, like that they prescribe to you because they know what you have, rather than just like, trying to deal with it, and like, that you could die, because you never even knew what was happening. So I'd like, want to have that back-up plan with me.\u000a  So, just to clarify, we're talking about an offense end, rather than a defense team. So, rather than waiting until you have it and reacting, taking preventative measures ahead of time.\u000a  Like an inhaler for asthma. Some people have to take their inhaler every single day, twice a day, morning and the afternoon, but there's other people who don't have it as severe, or a higher risk, not as high as a risk, who only take it when they're having an asthma attack. So, what you're saying is, having like the pill every day, constantly. I would still want to take that chance.\u000a  So, you would you want to take the pill?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  If you know you have cancer early enough, can't you get rid of it? Can't they get rid of it? If it's like... \u000a  Yes, the earlier you know, the better chance you have.\u000a  Yeah, that's why I would want to know.\u000a  I don't think it would matter that much because even if you do have cancer, that doesn't mean you're going to die from it. Like, you could get hit by a car today, and nobody could tell you that, nobody could predict that. So, I don't think... I wouldn't want to know, like if I was going to, if I have cancer or anything. I don't know, I don't think it's--\u000a  You don't know that that cancer's going to .\u000a  Yeah, and then I'm just going to be in fear all my life, like, thinking, like "Oh, I'm going to die from that." When that's not necessarily... Like, the, you know, exact thing that you're going to die from. Like, it's not a guarantee, so.\u000a  Very good.\u000a  Yeah, it's because of that--\u000a  Great job!\u000a  It's because of that maybe, that maybe, like you might be, like how that guy on the video said, you have a 99% of getting a heart disorder, you might be that one percent that doesn't get it. And you spend your whole life preparing, spending all this money on preventative measures, and getting all these pills, setting up stuff, and then you go through your whole entire life, and you don't even get it.\u000a  That's true.\u000a  That, he does have a point.\u000a  But then wouldn't you want to take those precautions, because--\u000a  You'd be happy that you did, but then you spent all that extra stuff.\u000a  But what if that extra stuff is what made you not get it?\u000a  No I mean, you don't like, you don't, get all the stuff just in case, and you don't take, it's like, you don't even take the medicine. It's only for like, when you have like, Travis said, if you have a seizure, you can take that, it stops it.\u000a  Well, that's kind of just like getting hit by a car.\u000a  Exactly.\u000a  Preventative measures is like, looking to see if there's cars, and if you don't look I mean, you could get run over, you could not. \u000a  But then you also, like, what if you lived in fear of getting that, taking all these precautions, is kind of wasting your life, trying to prepare for something that may or may not happen.\u000a  That's why people should, at the right age when you have the right maturity, decide whether you want to know or not, and not have it mapped out when you're born, whether you're going to die or not. Or by what.\u000a  In the movie, how they just like, took that thing.\u000a  Right.\u000a  That would be freaky as a woman. Like, you just went all throughout nine months of that, and now you get to find out that your child's going to die in it's kind of freaky.\u000a  That actually brings us to our next question.\u000a  Okay. What genes would you want to know your children had? Why, and how would that change you as a parent?\u000a  I wouldn't want to know, at all. I mean, that's part of giving like, human birth, the surprise, I guess.\u000a  It's a gamble.\u000a  You can't always like, create the perfect human being.\u000a  Well, if you could find out, what genes they were going to have, could you fix them? Like how that person got rid of the forehead thing?\u000a  Right now, no. But that is a direction we're heading in. You can, right now, completely sequence your child's genome, if you have the money, and get an approximation of what they will look like and what effects that--\u000a  That's messed up.\u000a  I don't care what my child would look like, I don't really care. But, I just don't, like you could prevent it from having, these like, life-threatening diseases, like cancer or Huntington's, or like Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's.\u000a  But then again, that's a way of like too, like... I would want to know life-threatening diseases, but not, because like you can cure, like seizures. You can like, can't you? Like, my friend's been cured of that. She had them and then now she doesn't anymore because she took medicine and stuff, now she doesn't have it. But there's people that have been taking those medicines, and then still have it now, which doesn't make sense.\u000a  Is that cured, or treated?\u000a  Treated.\u000a  Yeah. Cured means that you no longer have the disease. Treated means that it's managed with medication, or--\u000a  It's treated, then. Wait, it's cured. Yeah, it is cured.  But, anyways .\u000a  How would that change you as a parent, knowing that?\u000a  You would know what to do if you have it.\u000a  Stay with your child at all times.  I don't want my kid dying.\u000a  Your kid's going to be in like a stroller, until age 13.\u000a  See, it wouldn't change me as a parent. It just wouldn't change me.\u000a  I think it'd make someone stronger. Because going through all of that hard times, like with your child and it being sick and stuff, wouldn't that make you stronger than having a normal, healthy child? And make you closer to them?\u000a  But you would still love your child the same way. You would still try to have the best memories with your child, either way. If you knew that this, that your child was going to die, or not. You would still do the same thing. Except maybe change their diet, or...\u000a  Take more precautions.\u000a  Yeah, more precautions. Pad their room. They're going to be falling over and hurting themselves or something. But, you wouldn't change your experiences with your child.\u000a  I would.\u000a Well, I wouldn't. Would you Bernard?\u000a  What?\u000a  Change your experience with your child?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Just don't go to Disneyland, it's not worth it.\u000a  It's not worth it, he won't even remember it.\u000a  Nope.\u000a  Oh, the fifth question. What does any of this have to do with you?\u000a  Like as in personally, or as in?\u000a  That's a good question.\u000a  I'm confused.\u000a  Say that again.\u000a  As in personally?\u000a  Yeah, both ways, as in persoanlly and as in a generation. \u000a  Give yourself super powers?\u000a  Hey, stay on task. \u000a  Good job, Stella.\u000a  Thanks. \u000a  I guess you're just kind of getting us ready for the future, you know? Like, thinking, like about your children, like, in the future, like what if, like what if you really wanted to know, and then like, what would you actually do about it, if you've never thought about this before.\u000a  Is this technology possible?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Not quite yet. So, who's going to have to make those decisions?\u000a  Us.\u000a  Our generation.\u000a  This generation and next generation. \u000a  The genes are us. And if you want to know everything about yourself, if you want to know, then you have to go through the genes. But if you don't want to know, then you don't have to.\u000a  Yeah. And so those people that think it's like... That want to know, should... Wait, what? Never mind.\u000a  Should be able to.\u000a  Yeah, should be able to. And then, the people that don't want to know, shouldn't harp on them, they should just keep their opinions to themselves. And see it from their eyes too, and just have an open eye to it, not being so negative.\u000a  So what happens if, say half of society, would like to have their genomes sequenced, or their children's genome sequenced, and the other half does not want to, or doesn't have the means to, because it's probably going to cost money. Right? What might that, how might that impact society as a whole? Not just the individual. As in this country, individual's rights are paramount, right? Hmm?\u000a  So, it'll be messed up like it is already. \u000a How?\u000a

V So, we go back, remember this. Do not breathe at the end of a measure unless you have a rest. Okay? What's happening is things are getting not broken up. Another example of that would be measure 16 to 17. You would not want to breathe at the end of 16. Now, I want to go back to 13, and I want you to do what we did yesterday, where we changed all counted eighth notes to sixteenths and we get rid of ties. So what that does at 13 is it should da, da, da, da, da, da, da... da, da, da, da, da, da... da, da, daa, da, da, da, da... da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, dum. Okay? It's kind of funny to do that on the bass drum, so just play the regular part on the bass drum, okay?\u000a I can try to.\u000a Nah, I'd rather you not, because it's going to muffle-- it's going to kind of muddy up what everyone else is doing. Try it at 13, everybody. Da, da, da, da, da, da, da. Working on accents. One, two, and ready, and go. \u266a  \u266a Look at measure 15. Da, da, daa, da, da, da, da. What's happening is some of you are changing 15 to this. Tell me what's wrong with this. \u266a  \u266a Anybody recognize what's wrong with that? Adrian?\u000a  You played four.\u000a Yeah, I played four sixteenth notes, and then I played a note on beat four. It's got a one and two, three e and up. Listen again, here's the correct way. Oops, wrong finger. \u266a  \u266a Listen again. \u266a  \u266a Try that. Measure 15. One and two and ready and go. \u266a  \u266a Again. More accent. That last note's really short, and it's really strong. One, two, 15, and play. \u266a  \u266a Now, play it the way it's written, but feel it the way you just played it. That will give you the perfect subdivision of the dotted eighth sixteenth note. One, two, ready and go, and... \u266a  \u266a Okay, see how it places it very crisply.  Let's go back to 13. Play it. Break it down into the sixteenths. Da, da, da, da, da, da, da. Ready 13, we're going to go all the way through 20. One and two and ready and play, and... \u266a  \u266a\u000a,  Now, I'm going to get to what we are beginning to learn today. I'm going to go ahead and put my tie up here... Now, is there anyone who can tell me what this is? What is that, Daniel?\u000a  A dotted eighth note.\u000a This is a dotted eighth note. Who can tell me what this note is? Sedekia?\u000a  One sixteenth note.\u000a It is a sixteenth note, so we have a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note. Now remember our rule that we just went over this morning about the dot. With that in mind, can somebody tell me what the value of that note is? Cole?\u000a  It would last for like three beats.\u000a  Three beats...\u000a  And then you would have a sixteenth note. Okay, I think you're on the right track, it would last for three of something, but not three beats, Landon?\u000a  Three fourths of a beat?\u000a It would be three fourths of a beat, so let's think about this, remember, an eighth note in 4/4 time gets half of a beat. Everybody, what's half of a half?\u000a  One fourth.\u000a One fourth, so the dot is worth one fourth of a beat, that means that this dotted eighth note is three fourths of a beat. Well that sounds a little bit complicated, but all you need to do is think about this and apply it down here. So who can tell me what I would write for counts under this dotted eighth note? Raise your hand. Lydon?\u000a  Would it be one, e &?\u000a One e &, because that's the same as having three of both, and Jaylin what would go here?\u000a  a e.\u000a Okay, so this is just another way of writing this. Let's do a measure of counting that. Ready? And, go, and...\u000a  One e and a two, and one e and a two, and one e and a two, and one e and a two, and...\u000a Now, I want all my first row to do that four times, okay? And, go, and...\u000a  One e and a two, and one e and a two, and one e and a two, and one e and a two, and\u000a Second row, ready, and, go, and...\u000a  One e and a two, and one e and a two.\u000a

V Tyler pushed the ball.\u000a  Okay, well how does that, how does that affect the ball?\u000a It makes it go faster. And make it fall.\u000a  So why is that a problem?\u000a Because she ran because she, because she pushed it.\u000a  I know, but why is it a problem that she pushed it?\u000a Because it goes faster.\u000a  And that's a problem because? Because why?\u000a She didn't win.\u000a  Oh, what do you mean win?\u000a She win the game.\u000a  Oh, did you all make a game out of it?\u000a Uh uh, we didn't turn a game into it.\u000a  Okay, well what are you doing then? He's playing a game, what are you doing Kylie?\u000a He's rolling and see, not playing a game. Just rolling and seeing where they go.\u000a  Wait a minute what? Rolling them to see what?\u000a How many sticks it takes.\u000a  So did you push all of them or are you all taking turns doing each one?\u000a Taking turns.\u000a  Oh, okay. So do you think that to find out really how far they go everyone either needs to push them or everyone needs to not push them?\u000a Not push them.\u000a  So is that what you're saying, it wouldn't be fair if she pushes hers, but no one else pushes theirs? Because pushing makes it go faster you said. Okay. Alright so, it makes it what? Makes it go farther okay. Alright, so do you wanna, do you want, was anybody else pushing theirs?\u000a  Rebekah.\u000a  Okay, do you want Rebekah and Kylie to do theirs over again? Alright, show them how you and Todd did yours so that everybody can do theirs the same.\u000a Now I guess I'm gonna have to get our ball. \u000a I need ball number two. We need a Captain.\u000a Miss Henderson, can I be the Captain?\u000a  We don't need a Captain. You're all doing what, you're being what? We're not being Captain's, we're being what?\u000a  Scientists.\u000a  Scientists. So work together. \u000a  Wait, don't pick up her ball. She hasn't measured it yet.\u000a Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,\u000a  21 sticks.\u000a Where is 21?\u000a  You looking for it on the hundreds chart? Are you looking for it on the calendar? You can get up and point to it.\u000a  I got 18 sticks for my ball.\u000a  I can't find it anywhere.\u000a 18 sticks.\u000a I'm going to see how many sticks I got for my ball.\u000a  Okay, how would you find 21 on the chart?\u000a I don't know.\u000a  Where could you start?\u000a By one.\u000a  Okay.  \u000a 20,\u000a  Oh, you found it. Do you need more sticks honey?\u000a 17, yes.\u000a  Okay, go ask another group, can you borrow some sticks?\u000a Another ball. \u000a 12, So it takes half of 14.\u000a Because she said, "No, I'm using it." And she, and I said I have a idea and she said no.\u000a  What was your idea John?\u000a I was just trying do it on my head, like on my back of my head then down.\u000a  Use your head as a ramp?\u000a Uh huh.\u000a  And where did you have the ball hun?\u000a In her pocket the whole time.\u000a  Why Em? Does the ball belong to you or to the group?\u000a Group.\u000a  So if you're not using it, should you let someone else in the group use it? Okay, go ahead.  \u000a Roll it on my back. And now roll it. If it does it... Right here. No, I mean like right here.\u000a  Where do you want them to, where do you want them to start the ball? I think is what they're asking.\u000a In my head, somewhere like right here.\u000a  Because a ramp starts where?\u000a On the top.\u000a  Up high. And goes down. So if you're using his head?\u000a I would lay like this.\u000a  Oh. Did that work?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  What do we do with it, after we do our balls?\u000a  Okay, you can just keep experimenting with the balls and the ramps and we're gonna clean up in just a second. Put your name at the top of your paper please.\u000a  We used it on this one.\u000a  You're supposed to do all four of the balls. Ball number one, ball number two, ball number three, ball number four.\u000a  We would do ball number three?\u000a Number one is this one. How about number one?\u000a But this one. Which number is that one?\u000a So get number three, we'll have a race and we'll...   \u000a  So what are you all doing with the ramp now?\u000a We're putting it on the chair. And whoever gets it, whoever gets down to the bottom first. \u000a We were actually gonna roll off it.\u000a  Well, why won't it roll off that ramp? Because why? What stops it?\u000a The block.\u000a  The block stops it, okay. So.\u000a How much does it go? Try the little one. Whoever is in front of me move.\u000a I got 10. \u000a Miss Henderson, everybody is taking our balls.\u000a  Okay, guys I would like for you to clean up your things please. I saw some great science learning, science work, put everything back in your basket and then please meet me on the rug.  Put your paper at your seat. Quickly. Let's see how quickly we can clean up. Id like for you to come to the rug and share some things you've learned. John, you have to put everything back in your basket buddy. All the sticks and balls please. And then you may put your basket on the art table.  Thank you to everybody who's moving quickly. Thank you to everybody who's moving quickly.   Okay, let's come to the rug and let's share some things that you learned today. Move that way please. I said put your paper at your seat for now.\u000a Miss Henderson, Braxton said this isn't whistling. \u000a  Okay, well we're not gonna debate whistling right now. Okay, thanks so much for everybody coming back to the rug. Okay, I would like to know who learned something about balls or ramps or forces in your science work today? Tell us something you did, something you figured out. Bryson.\u000a If you push the ball it goes farther. If you don't push the ball it goes not farther.\u000a  Okay, alright. Who else learned something else through their science work? John.\u000a That when you put like a stick in front of it and then you put another ball in front of it and then like you roll the ball and see how much it goes. And then you try another ball and see like if it gets to the stick and if it doesn't get to the stick then it gets farther and, and we tried whoever gets to the stick. It goes, it's the same height then we just rolled it and then the green ball got the farthest.\u000a  Okay, the green, okay. Todd, what's something you learned today through your science work?\u000a If you push it it'll go farther and that's it.\u000a  Okay, alright anything else we haven't mentioned, Eli?\u000a There's a block in front of it and if you move the block a little it, it will go past it. If you make a ball, if you make a block go all the way across it and you have a big ball it might bounce across it or it might stop.\u000a  So the block stopped it sometimes?\u000a Yes.\u000a  Sometimes the ball was going fast enough to jump over it?\u000a Yeah. But sometimes it stopped it. Okay, Grayson.\u000a Well, sometimes what I did was I kinda put the ramp like that and a little block across and then I was rolling this big ball and once it hit it, it kinda like jumped up in the air and went--\u000a  Harleigh.\u000a And moved in. And for like three blocks for three sticks.\u000a  Okay, Preston, what did you learn today?\u000a If you, like if your hand go fast, the ball goes fast. If your hand goes slow, the ball goes slow.\u000a  If your hand goes fast, what do you mean by if your hand goes fast?\u000a Like if you're at the bottom and  and you do that. And go like that it goes fast.\u000a  What is that called that you're doing?\u000a Pushing the thing.\u000a  So if you push the ball fast it goes fast and if you push it slow, it goes slow?\u000a The force.\u000a  Interesting. The force of pushing, okay Chloe.\u000a I learned that when you lay it diagonal it goes--\u000a  When you lay what diagonal?\u000a What is it called again?\u000a  What?\u000a A diagonal line.\u000a When you lay it down diagonal it goes down faster.\u000a  What is she talking about Eli, the what?\u000a She's talking about a ramp.\u000a  Oh the ramp, when you lay the ramp diagonal?\u000a Uh huh. The ball goes fast. When you lay it straight it doesn't go fast, it just sits there.\u000a  Oh, so if it's, if it's less. If it's a lower ramp it goes less. If it's a higher diagonal ramp you're talking about, then it goes farther? Interesting, Brody?\u000a We tried it with our heads like down and the ball goes down like that.\u000a  So you made, you made ramps with your bodies? So did it go-\u000a

V  More important, 'cause  their friend Maser--  something died the day before, and they stayed in the village for that long. They didn't have to stay, but they decided to stay. They didn't have to do that, but they just chose to do that because they felt it was more important.\u000a  Well, and it may have been a choice for safety also, if they stay with him. If they run to another village, they may be, you know, picked off.\u000a  Trying to stick  to the customs that they are so used to, like back in normal life, and stuff like that. So, trying to get back in that. But, the fact that they did wait kept them from their real life, like their parents, and stuff.\u000a  But saved their lives.\u000a  Yeah. Okay. Emily and Simon. Simon?\u000a  Emily.\u000a  Emily and Spencer, I mean.\u000a  Simon? \u000a  That's her last name.\u000a  Do you believe the boys were right for getting mad at whatever his name is after they got to the village, and blaming him for missing?\u000a  I think anyone would get mad. They need to get it out on someone.\u000a  What do you mean by being right to get mad?\u000a  Do they have, like...\u000a  A valid purpose?\u000a  A valid reason for getting mad.\u000a  I mean, yeah.\u000a  They were probably just mad out of frustration.\u000a  If you would have went in with them before, like earlier, before the rebels attacked, they wouldn't have been able to see their families. So, that's what their drive has been for the past couple months, or however long they've been running. It's to get back to their families. Even if they would have died, I mean. That's what he was saying, is that he was mad at him, at Dishmrael  for holding him back, because he could have seen his family,\u000a  He would have died.\u000a  But then, later on  when his mind cooled down, he was like, yeah well, he saved my life, 'cause I would have been killed.\u000a  It was probably  like an in-the-moment thing.\u000a  I think in that  kind of situation, you always look for someone to blame.\u000a  'Cause there is  no way he could have known soldiers were gonna attack them, so we should hurry, and go see them. He thought they had time to go and see their family. Like, let's stop and rest, and stuff like that. There's no way he could have known that was gonna happen, so they can't really blame him, but they need to blame someone.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  I'd want  to punch someone too.\u000a  I'd be so mad if  that happened to me. I understand why they would blame him, but looking back on it...\u000a  And how does his age impact that, also?\u000a  Well he's not...\u000a  He' not really  old enough to really think about it.\u000a  All he's thinking about is his family.\u000a  With maturity,  you think before you act, but as a little kid, you just act, and don't know the consequences.\u000a  Well, and he has no life experience to prepare him for this at all. There's another aspect.\u000a  And he used to  follow Junior, and everything he did, but now that Junior's gone, he doesn't even have that.\u000a  Right. Exactly. Okay, keep going.\u000a  War is hell.\u000a  Oh yeah, you can...  Sorry about that.\u000a  It's okay.\u000a  So, want to go, Kaylee?\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Ask the question.\u000a  The question: Girda is a young woman at the time of the book, and so was Valentino and Wutuzuwut . How do they change through the course of the book, due to the tragic events in their lives.\u000a  I think they're  forced to grow up real fast, because of all the pressures. At the time, I mean, Valentino doesn't know his age, but let's say, like 15 and 20; and when, I haven't read the end of this book, but she comes home to America, and so does Valentino, and they just come over; and even though they're like like a 40-year-old. So, it's kinda weird coming back to America, and trying to enjoy all the child pleasures.\u000a  Yeah, the whole event  just kinda makes them, you know, kinda step it up a bit. If something like this happens to you, you don't easily forget it. It becomes more of a part of you. It kinda takes out who you really are inside.\u000a  Yeah, it shapes you.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Well, and how did the stages in their life coincide. That's a good question, Kaylee.\u000a  Well, first of all, genocide, I thought, was basically, kind of done the same, so it was usually like they lost their families, they're forced to go out on their own, they're forced to make a life for themselves. And both of them kind of think, or know, that their parents are dead. And so, they kind of use their families in a way to keep them going, and just like other people in their lives that have motivated them, 'cause I think Ile , or, I don't know how to say her name. She kind of motivated Girda to kind of stay in the camp with her, and have maybe a friend there, where with Abek's  family, she wouldn't really have a friend, she'd just have, like she'd owe it to their family to do things for them. And then with Achek , he had William K. to help him--\u000a  Just had a friend to make it through.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So they both had a  strong friend. What kind of life did they both live before disaster struck?\u000a  They both had the  perfect, ideal family life, you know. They were happy. They were all together. It was, you know, like what would happen in a Disney movie, pretty much. Everything's kinda perfect. And then, something happens in the first. Both, in the person that happens to meet, their family ties are cut. And their survival depends on whether they can kinda ban together with the people around them, and kinda grow, and become stronger.\u000a  Yeah. I think...\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  No, you go.\u000a  Okay. They were just,  I mean, they were forced to grow up. And they just lived, like Ryan said, like the ideal life, with their family, or whatever. But once their parents left, they had to find a friend, or someone to group with, in order to--\u000a  Well, what were they  replacing? What were they replacing, with William K and Ile ?\u000a  Yeah. They established a family without being blood related.\u000a  They just had  to make it through by that. It's 'cause if you don't have motivation, then you're not going to get through things, so even though they didn't know that their... I mean, they assumed their parents were dead, but they didn't know for sure. 'Cause on page 80 of this, I mean, she said that she never saw her father again. But, just to know that their parents are alive, and they just want to regroup with them at the end keeps them motivated and alive.\u000a  Not knowing. They  both have that in common.\u000a  Right.\u000a  Assuming that they're dead,  but not really knowing for sure.\u000a  Just to keep them  motivated to survive, so it's a good tactic.\u000a  So what is a really  simple message that we can take from that, from both of their stories? What do you need in your life?\u000a  Motivation.\u000a  You need family. You need some kind of family unit to...\u000a  Survive. Or friends.\u000a  Everyone needs like someone to kinda like go to, and they can depend on, no matter what the situation is.\u000a  Right, and if you're  going to friends a lot of time, at least in like a high school, or whatever; you go to friends with questions, instead of your family, or whatever, sometimes you'll get the wrong side of view on things, and it will change your life drastically. 'Cause your friends determine how your high school is gonna be, determines how the rest of your life...\u000a  But also, you  got a different perspective, 'cause your family doesn't necessarily know what's going on in your own high school.\u000a  Yeah, so it's  good to get both, but family is more important 'cause you can count on them more usually.\u000a  And they're older and wiser. You need that kind of like wise person, 'cause my mom knows more than I do or my friends.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  But you need those  relationships as connections, right?\u000a  Right, to keep motivated.\u000a  Both of those stories show that really, literally life and death situations; those connections with other humans. It is a human basic need that we have to make those connections. Or you cannot survive. I think both of those stories... That's a really good question, in looking at the stages. It also shows globally... Globally, what can we say about families? At the beginning of the story... you were talking about, it's like a Disney movie, right?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So what can we say about families literally around the world?\u000a  They're all usually together. Nobody ever leaves their children when their toddlers to go find where, like how they're supposed to live, and like, what's good and bad. You usually nurture your kids 'til they're about nineteen, and then they go off to college. I think that's just how it is everywhere. It may not be that way in some places, but you usually have schooling, and then you go off, and then you figure out for yourself, once you've got a base.\u000a  Yeah, they're  usually pretty perfect or ideal, until like a third party, like Nazis or the Arabians come in and just wipe that out, and changes a lot drastically to where they have to depend on themselves, and I guess their friends, since they didn't have family.\u000a  And that family unit seems to lend to safety, even if you're living in  Sudan or if you're living in Poland. The children both at the beginning feel very safe in their lives, right?\u000a  Right.\u000a  And if nobody knows you, what makes you... if you die who would care? That's what I would think. Like, if nobody cared about me, or nobody knew who I was.\u000a  That's, what,  a lot of suicidal thoughts...\u000a  Yeah.\u000a \u000a  I was just thinking.  I don't think that, but I'm just saying, if I had nobody to be like I care about you. You need to stay alive, or like your parents. There wouldn't be a reason to live.\u000a  Yeah, but like  in those stories, like they find symbolic fixtures, or whatever. I think in both, yeah, the moon. They look at the moon and they see, they just see the moon, and it's like their kinda friend. But they also hope that the moon will find their parents somewhere, or wherever they are, 'cause they don't know.\u000a  Yeah, their parents  are looking at the same thing that they're seeing, kinda.\u000a  Yeah, so it's  kinda like, right there, keeping them together.\u000a  And what's funny,  is that's a main... the moon is a main symbol in a long way gone.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  And he refers to that also.\u000a  I think 'cause the moon can be seen anywhere on earth. It's a connection, I think, somewhere. Yeah.\u000a  Yeah, totally.\u000a  It's kinda like the  bright light in darkness. You know, the night, it's a pictch black, but the moon's shining. You know, kinda there no matter what. Good. Okay, keep going.\u000a  And the German's  are just coming in, and everything's getting really bad. And like going back to their past, and showing it as such a nice place. What she does, is she ends up showing how much darker it is by comparison.\u000a  Okay, what was the question?\u000a  How does the author  implement setting to contrast, good and evil? How is it affected?\u000a  Okay.\u000a  ...purpose. And we just finished talking about how it shows the atrocities to be even darker, because it's happening in this nice place.\u000a  But she's forced  to saying the dark side of things, 'cause she's forced into her basement, where it's all dark, and you know, there's mildew on the wall, and it's flooded, and it's just really gross down there. And that's what's happening outside of the happy little hometown that she grew up in. And then, her childhood is marked with flowers and the sunny days. You know, running with her friends, and chasing butterflies, and eating sweets. And it's just really happy, and bright, and cheery. And so, there's a major contrast.\u000a  And, as you go into the  book, does that darkness continue? Or is it broken by light? How does she portray darkness and light even when she goes to the camps?\u000a  There's...\u000a  Go ahead, but I have an answer.\u000a  OK. \u000a  At least up to the point where we've read, she's kind of reached a climax of how bad things are when her parents were taken away from her and everything. Arthur's letters stopped coming. And that's kind of the climax from how far we've gotten, where the darkness is. So now it's about finding the good things that are in that darkness.\u000a  Right. I think she has little flashes of good things, and the smallest of things to us brings such hope to her, of a bright future. But it is surrounded by darkness.\u000a  And in the camp, did she talk about physically light and dark also?\u000a  Like the dramas,  and she wrote plays; And they had fun there.\u000a  The single light shining in the dark room .\u000a  Do you have anything to add, Abbey? Can you think of times when she talked about light? Physically, light in the camps? I was trying to think. And how does she portray it? 'Cause that is an interesting motif in the book, the light and dark. And it will continue to play a part. Which camp is she in at the middle part?\u000a  She's in the, I can't pronounce it. It's the first one, where she's, they're sewing, they're weaving.\u000a  So they're at the looms, right?\u000a  Yeah, they're at the looms.\u000a  Did she pass  through Auschwitz? Or was that the one, she was in jail? I think she passed through Volkenheim ?\u000a  Yeah. Does she ever get outside? That would be a key, at Volkenheim .\u000a  Outside of the camp itself?\u000a  Just outside, in the outside.\u000a  Well, here's a  reference to outside. She talks about how the night was starry and beautiful. "From Heirgonk  I could see the hill through a window. Slowly, the full moon rose..." So that is like a light in the darkness, literally. Because the stars... the moon and the stars are the brightest things at night in the sky, and just, her finding that comfort in that, also shows really extreme light and dark.\u000a  But her comfort comes at night, in the darkness. And she has one source of light. So keep looking for those motifs of light and dark 'cause they play a part throughout. Have any of you gotten past the halfway point?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Yeah, we've gotten  a little bit past.\u000a  In the march, you know that becomes very important. Alright, good. Good job. Alright, you guys! Bell's gonna ring. Keep your questions for tomorrow\u000a

V In the Lion King, like I was thinking about it, there's no democracy in any of the movie.\u000a  No, there isn't.\u000a Yeah, and how the Lion King's, like everything seems really British, you know, like very England, monarchy-type stuff. But in the Lion King, what bothered me is when it said like, the two hyenas, like Cheech from Cheech and Chong was one of them, and then Whoopi Goldberg was the other one. I was just like, how could they do that, and like not realize that they were feeding into this racial stereotype by being the voices of the hyenas? Like don't they think about that stuff?\u000a  Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.\u000a  Did you think about it before, when you first read Cinderella?\u000a I think when I watched the Lion King, like I thought about it. I mean, even when I was little, I think it registered in my mind, like, "That's a black woman's voice. "Why would her voice be in this animal, "and not any of the other voices?"\u000a  Right. I don't know Disney intentionally did this. They were building up into an already existing culture of racial stereotypes, so I think the mentality of that was why fix what's not been broken, and when they should have fixed it.\u000a  But at the same time, Mufasa was that really, what's his name? James Earl Jones, who's like Morgan Freeman.\u000a  Right, Mufasa was an evil--\u000a Like if I had to pick a God, it would be James Earl Jones or Morgan Freeman.\u000a  Mufasa was the good, Simba's father, right?\u000a  Yeah. With like the really deep voice.\u000a  You made a good point, though, about no democracy in Disney movies. There isn't, because there's no democracy in marketing. There's no democracy in the media. What are the six big media conglomerates? Disney.\u000a  Disney, GE ...\u000a What else?\u000a  GE.\u000a GE.\u000a  Newscorp.\u000a Yeah, Newscorp.\u000a  Then Viacom.\u000a Viacom.\u000a  Time Warner.\u000a And Time Warner.\u000a  But why can't Cinderella be a first lady? Why does she have to be a queen? Like why can't she have some other magical power?\u000a Why can't we instill some like, actual life in there?\u000a But that's still not, this is still not the classic, but then I wouldn't be surprised if Disney will come up with another story.\u000a  I hope they do.\u000a Well, they came up with Tiana, right? Which added the gender stereo- the roles, the racial roles, or the racial stereotypes. Tiana is absolutely beautiful. The image. However, there are, again, the pre-existing culture and norms that Disney is too scared to move away from, because that has provided them or given them this 80 billion dollar industry. I did promise you a reading on, we do have time, I promised you a reading on China, as to what happens in China. Before I do that, I just want your input on the Disneyfication of children's culture, with the article that you read. I know you wanted to talk about it, you were really excited. If you have your article in front of you, you can use that. You can look at it. I also jotted down plenty of notes, but when you reflect on what we did today, I want you to think, these books, these books are books are media, music is media, videos are media, okay? Food for thought for next time when we have our discussion: Does media construct an image or a message? There's no right or wrong answer, but think about it. Does the media construct an image or a message? Okay? As you read your read articles. So, Hannah, to you, go ahead.\u000a  The whole like Aladdin where, how they changed the verse, the lyrics, that was like awful.\u000a  That was crazy!\u000a Like, I think I have a different opinion from everybody, like, truth hurts, to me. I think it's just like, I don't care that it says that. Like, I didn't notice that, no one notices that while they're singing. Like, while they're singing that, no one like realizes, oh, "Cut off your ear."\u000a  Kids don't. Like if your  was in--\u000a And that actually happened back then, that actually happened.\u000a  The ear one didn't bother me as much, because that's kind of true. But the whole, it's barbaric, the  like that was awful. It shouldn't be--\u000a  Because if you think about where it is, if you look into the history, it is barbaric, and they used to do it. And in some places, they still do it. It's the whole Hammurabi, "An eye for an eye." You know, it's that culture.\u000a  Yeah, it's true, it's true, so why not teach what actually happened?\u000a But I don't really have a problem with it, I mean like--\u000a But if that's the only way that you're looking at the Middle East, then that's wrong. Because they have a history with beautiful art, they invented math, and like they gave us all this wonderful stuff, that you can't just look at the problems that they have now, or the violence that was in their culture, because there's violence everywhere.\u000a I mean, that's just stereotyping.\u000a They cut people's ears off in the Middle Ages in England just as much as they did, or at least as the same.\u000a They did worse things, probably, in the Middle Ages, than they did in cutting off people's ears.\u000a It's just unfair that they portayed the Middle East like strictly as a barbaric, violent place in that song. It just makes it wrong.\u000a  I think it was like in general, and it was because Arabia was so bad in an oasis like that.\u000a  Yeah, they weren't specific, it was just "Arabia," but like it took, there was like Indian things about Aladdin that it wasn't supposed to be India, it was supposed to be like Israel, or totally different--\u000a There were a lot of like Middle Eastern elements rolled into one, so it would make one thing, like if you went to the Middle East, if you went to like Pakistan, it wouldn't be what they say it is, or if you went to India or you went to Israel, like they just took bits and pieces and combined it into one. Which looks like a different--\u000a  Why did they do that? What would you think--\u000a They didn't look into it, they didn't bother to do the research.\u000a  Yeah, they probably didn't--\u000a  Because their culture is so different than American culture, that they just thought that they could just skip over it. Like I thought it was gross that they didn't even bother to translate what they wanted to say on a manuscript. Like if it was in English, they would have had the actual letters on the piece of paper, but they just, you think that you can just go like this on the board, and that looks like Arabic writing? That's not--\u000a Arabic writing is really complicated.\u000a And the whole thing with all the accents, how all the bad guys had accents, and the good guys didn't. The bad guys had like--\u000a Oh, the beards and noses?\u000a Bigger beards, and then the good guys, they looked American.\u000a  I think it made you assume the worst, like reading that just made me like, "Wow," like, "Oh my gosh," it's not really giving you the information--\u000a  But yet, you didn't notice it when you watched it though, right?\u000a  Yeah, I mean, you didn't at all.\u000a  I did, though.\u000a But then when we're older, we go back in history--\u000a Maybe that's because I have that class and we realized that it's all war with religion, and like I know those times.\u000a  Go ahead. Religion, what about it?\u000a She noticed that--\u000a I did notice those things, like you can kind of tell like different culturally-wise, like the different Indian elements in Israel, or the different like Pakistani influences, but, and they had like Hindu going on. It's just really, really weird. But I did notice that, but like, I don't know, maybe like Hannah said, she didn't notice that, but because she didn't grow up like learning to write Arabic,\u000a  No.\u000a And like reading about all that stuff. I guess it's also like, how you grew up.\u000a Right.\u000a Someone who showed America, like  without photos.\u000a I have a question. When you think about it, when we talk about American culture, we view it as pretty homogeneous, of the American values. Okay, there are these values, and that's all there is. But we know that that's not true. Do you find that to be, with these movies, by blending all of those different spaces, and all those different cultures, do you find that to be the message is not carried out the right way to children, that the Middle East is highly diverse, okay? And not everybody looks the same, or writes the same, or behaves the same, but Disney has done something that the media does. What does the media assume? That everybody who watches a movie--\u000a  Is going to react the same way.\u000a  It's going to react the same way, right? So the media assumes that homogeneity attitude. Yes?\u000a The problems in the past 20 years in the Middle East, like when little kids grow up, and it's like, if I look at a picture of Osama bin Laden, I think, "Jafar," because he has a beard and he looks like that. Like we're taught that that is evil.\u000a  Do you really? I don't.\u000a That the person with the turban and beard is evil, because the terrorists that are doing these awful things to people all over the world, just happen to be Muslim, totally extremist Muslims that most of the people that carry out their religion don't practice. Kind of like most Christians during the Middle Ages didn't go out and chop people's heads off in the name of Jesus. It's the same thing.\u000a  Right.\u000a You know? But we look at those pictures of those Middle Eastern men and we think bad because of it, which is like Jafar and Aladdin.\u000a  That's when acceptance comes in, like--\u000a  You have to accept what's true and what's not.\u000a Exactly.\u000a Talk about ignorance, I mean, why do we have to accept that?\u000a  Because it's not true.\u000a Because it's not true, there are thousand and thousands\u000a You don't see me going like, "Oh, I'm making bombs."\u000a I'm not like saying acceptance like it's not true, I'm not like saying acceptance like, Osama bin Laden, like accepting that's what he looks like to like Jafar. Like, that's who he was, so that's what he looks like. You know what I'm saying?\u000a Yeah, but I don't see that. If I see, if I look at Osama bin Laden, I don't see Jafar.\u000a No I don't either.\u000a I don't identify it at all.\u000a I don't either, but you know what I'm saying?\u000a Yeah, like little kids like 10 years from now, if they watch Aladdin and they're going to grow up, and what's going to be in the news is September 11th and Osama bin Laden.\u000a But what the point is is that evil people look like everybody else. Like, Ursula could have just been a really pretty mermaid, and still done all the horrible things that she did to Ariel.\u000a  Right.\u000a Like it doesn't matter what you look like, they create these evil images of people, like all old ladies are either really smart or they're evil. They either have wisdom or they're out to get you. There's no in-between.\u000a  Or the zoo-keeper in , he had a German accent, he was evil, and that was during a war, the movie.\u000a Or like the three crows, right? That were talking in like the very like, I don't know, African-American, inner-city slang, and they were, just all that stuff that was just really--\u000a  It kinds of makes it, like just like the story was describing what a bad person must look like, we have that image like up here, like tell them it looks like this, so when we see them, we automatically assume like, "Oh man, it could be a terrorist," just like when we watch a movie, like, "Oh, that's the bad guy." So like it's the same as if they're doing a cartoon, and if we're in real life.\u000a Right, so that leads to problems that we have with profiling, for example. Putting people on one side, or, yes?\u000a  It doesn't really relate to the article, but I was watching a movie with my mom, and I don't know what it was called, but there's this like, I guess class project, or oral presentation that someone had to do, and this girl chose to write about her religion, which she was Muslim, and she wrote about like 9/11 and she was like, "Just because they did that "doesn't mean we're all evil." And like I don't know, she had all this stuff, and then the principal like told the FBI or something, and they came to her house and deported her family back to where she came from. Just because of that. That's it.\u000a  That's when like a school needs to teach acceptance. That's not the end. Or like families and the school needs to teach acceptance. Everyone was calling her like a suicide bomber, and like, "Go kill yourself," or, "Are you gonna bomb all of us?"\u000a  And we call ourselves a country of freedom of religion.\u000a  I remember when I was in sixth grade, there was a girl, she was Muslim, and people used to throw markers at her and stuff, and call her a terrorist. It was around 9/11 and stuff like that, and it used to like upset me because I used to feel really bad. Because she like didn't do anything, she barely even knew how to talk. They'd like throw markers at her and stuff, just because she was Muslim.\u000a Like, because like no one has acceptance, like no one learns that, it's just like people make inferences, like, "Oh, man, it's a bad person, "so let's stay away, let's shy away, "let's make fun of them," instead of like, when you're going down the street, and just like we were talking about earlier, how there's like, if you see a big black man, you're gonna put your phone away, you're going to take your phone out and try to call your mom, put her on speed dial. You don't have acceptance, either. Like you may say we should get it, but you don't have it. It's just the way we grow up.\u000a  We don't suspend judgment.\u000a  You don't suspend judgment. It's difficult to do so. There is this conflict between acceptance and our values. Because the values that we have, that think by this individualistic view of what it is, and in doing so, you divide people into groups, and construct images about those people, and it's as simple as reading a children's story, okay, or as watching or turning the TV on in the morning and just watching the Disney Channel, or Noggin, or Nick, Jr., or whatever. There's messages that we impart on our children, there's messages that we impart on ourselves. Or picking up the newspaper. I don't know if you guys have noticed in the newspaper, but there is a big, there's a dichotomy between how different areas are described. Immediate areas, our city compared to our surrounding areas.\u000a \u000a Right, so media is biased. They're systemically biased, okay? There is no democracy, but here is the fundamental thing as an American, we pride ourselves in democracy, we pride ourselves in leadership, so what do you do? What path do you follow? How do you--\u000a

Dawn?\u000a F?\u000a F, this time you may use your whole instrument for the question, you have to start on F but don't end on F. Ready, set and get question here we go.  Good, didn't hear anybody end on F. I did, make your X for a second. I heard some people's questions that maybe sounded like this.  I don't really remember what notes I played, I was just kinda doing whatever I wanted to up and down up and down. Could I sing that?\u000a No? \u266b Valentine, valentine \u266b\u000a  Probably not. But if my question sounded like this--  Could I sing that? Probably. Did I use some patterns in that like a good musician? I did. \u266b Valentines, valentines \u266b Pink, red and blue \u266b Okay? Try it. You don't have to do the same thing I did, but let's do some repeated notes, let's use some patterns and let's not be all up and down our instrument. Ready, set and here you go.  Not bad. Let's try the answer, boys and girls. Start at any note you want but end on N. And let's make it memorable and singable. Something you can remember, something you can sing. I made a pretty one just for you. Ready, set and here you go.  Not bad, not bad. Here's what I would like to have happened. I'm going to ask the question, Tyler's going to give the answer. I'm going to ask the question, Amanda's going give an answer. I'm gonna ask the question, answer, question, answer, question, answer, question, answer. And then the next row we're going to switch. Paige question, me answer. Kia question, me answer, you get it? Okay?\u000a Yay!\u000a  Shh. Paige, would you mind before we begin, arrowing over to the last slide. I want to show you what I am looking for. Yeah, go for it. When you are doing, yeah keep going. When you are doing your question, or when you are, keep going. Sorry, keep going. That's it, okay! Here's what I'm looking for. Are you alternating your mallets? Are you bouncing your mallets? Are you doing the correct rhythm? Did your question start on doe if you're the question? Did your answer end on doe if you're the answer? Was your melody memorable and singable? Here we go. My turn first, so we'll go question answer down the batch feels, and you get it. Todd. \u000a I forget the--\u000a I made this pretty one just for you.  Paige, question is ready, here you go.\u000a Do I start this time?\u000a  Yeah, you start this time. Yeah, you're going to do the question now I'm giving you the answer.  Now, question, answer, question, answer. Let's actually do this. Question, answer, question, answer. Question, answer. Ready, Britney? Josh you get ready to do the answer. Ready, Britney, here she goes.  Oh, you know what Ben, it sounded like the end was ended on a doe.\u000a Oh, yeah.\u000a  All right, you want to try it again? That's why Eli was like--\u000a Oh.\u000a  Yeah, okay?  Ready, go.  Good, Sabrina, go.\u000a It's, um--\u000a  Question.\u000a Okay.  Nice job. Now, some of you didn't get a chance to do the question or didn't get a chance to do the answer. Right? So here's what I'm going to have you do. And we have 30 seconds to do this. With the person next to you, one of you do the question, one of you do the answer, okay?   Let's try it together! Ready, set and here we go.  Answer.  Nice. Here's the beauty of the pentatonic scale, boys and girls. No matter if we're doing a million different things at the same time, if we're all on different bars, the notes of the pentatonic scale sound so good together that you can could be playing something else and it still sounds musical.\u000a

V  Okay.\u000a  What's the next one, Zach?\u000a  \u000a  Jen, you can put on a 50-line poem on that one here if you wanted to.\u000a  I got that.\u000a  You have \u000a  Okay what was the main? What was the summary?\u000a  What would be a good summary sentence?\u000a  \u000a  Well, they competed in a game known as the Memoriad.\u000a Uh huh. You guys had that one, don't you? You have the names and faces there. That was great.\u000a  The game. \u000a  Are you doing the vocab though?\u000a  No.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  So wait, hang on. Should we do the pictures or the vocabulary words?\u000a  You can just do anything from that article. The pictures were just to get you thinking about it. That's why we did the words. And the vocab was just to help us understand. So it doesn't have to go off the vocab. But the vocab kind of connects with an idea. So it may kind of work out that way. You'll have to let Zach see, because you took what he had, which is great, and you added to it.\u000a  Do we put the name of the movie?\u000a  I'm doing . It's a song. The croak part is a song.\u000a Mm-hmm, that was part of the.\u000a  Okay, I was getting.\u000a  There, there's the song.\u000a  \u000a  I was stuck on the reading one too.\u000a  Got one left.\u000a Zach, what's the text structure?\u000a Sharpening his pencil.  Just go like that.\u000a  So was the Puppet in 1970? Or was it?\u000a Yep, 1970.\u000a  That must have been old.\u000a 1968 is when the Yellow Submarine came out. Yep.\u000a  \u000a All right. Do you guys want to put your pyramid up there? Zach, do you want to help do that? Do you agree that he was right on the text structure?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a See if you can build it. I tried to size it just about right, as close as I could get. So it should fit in there pretty good.\u000a  I don't think it's sized up very well.\u000a  What? I just got it as close as I could, Zach. It may not be 100% perfect. And then the person that didn't read the story can read us what you guys put for your answers.\u000a  That means we got to do another one.\u000a You each got a chance to read.\u000a  Yeah, that's the tone one.\u000a We need one more detail. Did I make it a little too big, or is it pretty close?\u000a  It's a little long.\u000a  Could be a little long, huh? Had a little extra at the bottom. Next time I'll shrink it up just a little bit.\u000a  We still have one more.\u000a That's fine. And who read it? Was it Zach?\u000a  \u000a We'll let Zach read those when the girls get done.\u000a  Okay. Do I read the summary?\u000a  Do you just want me to read? I don't know if he knows.\u000a  Start with the details.\u000a  Memoriad is an unforgettable competition. Memoriad games is memorize 50-line poems. People compete in the games called Memoriad. The game is to memorize it.  Memorize names and faces and memorize a 50-line poem.\u000a Very good. And what was your text structure?\u000a  Description.\u000a Description, because they were describing all about \u000a   He just talked.\u000a He did the talking, you did the writing. Somebody gave you ideas.\u000a Kinda maybe.\u000a It was a good partnership. The girls are just about done. We'll let them read theirs. And then we'll do our Jeopardy.\u000a  Can we tape the Jeopardy game?\u000a Mm-hmm, yep.\u000a  We have the same people in Jeopardy that were in here.\u000a Yes, it is the same group. Okay, let's not have a sword fight right now. She has one more task there. She's got it all grammatically correct.\u000a  Okay. \u000a Let's just, Judy over here.\u000a  Do you mind if it's off to the side?\u000a  There's another one.\u000a There's two of them. Oh, did it fall off? Well, we can put a little piece of tape over it. Oh, here it is. There you go, that should hold it up good. All right, see if you agree with what the girls have here. Are you listening, Zach? Got a pyramid all set up.\u000a  Our text structure is, wait, do I start at the bottom?\u000a Start at the bottom, and the details kind of add to the summary.\u000a   The movie they were talking about was the Yellow Submarine, starring. Is it starring or staring?\u000a Starring, I bet.\u000a  Starring the Beatles.\u000a  The Beatles, okay. Their song called Being Green was made in 1970. Summary, the television was made in 1953. Kermit was in 1970. Stoplight was made in 1920. They all had one thing in common. They were in a color.\u000a Very good. I love that last sentence. They all have that in common, they're in color.\u000a  Text structure is sequence.\u000a Sequence because?\u000a It tells the order of them.\u000a All the years, very good. Okay, one of you guys go grab a marker board, one from each team. And I'll go get Jeopardy. And you'll need a marker to write on the marker board. I will pull the screen down. All right, Zach, Zach.\u000a  Where are the markers?\u000a  You can grab one back there. There's one up here. As long as you got one or two for your group, you can take turns. Now, these questions I think will flow pretty well today.\u000a  Whoa, I can't even see it. I think the yellow is better. I know with the lights on, it's a little harder, but it helps to have the lights on.\u000a  Did we run review?\u000a  What?\u000a  Did we run review?\u000a  \u000a  Text structure!\u000a  My music didn't come on.\u000a  Confucius says! Vocab. Text features.\u000a  Features. Thank you, Zach. Yes, they're different.\u000a  Confucius says?\u000a  Yeah. Okay who started first last time? Was it the guys?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay, we'll let the gals start today.\u000a  So do I do text structure?\u000a  Oh, you're gonna win.\u000a  Text structure 500.\u000a  Text structure 500.\u000a  Yeah, what's the "Confucius Says"?\u000a  We had done these little matching things way back at the beginning of the year when we did this unit, they were little sayings, and you decide just which text structure they go with.\u000a  So that might go with text structure.\u000a  Yes, it'll be a text structure question, yeah.\u000a  \u000a  Is that what you guys wanted was text structure, right?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  In our state, dams have been built\u000a  Zach.\u000a  on many rivers. These dams are used to product electricity we need. But they also create problems.\u000a  Scoot your chair closer to your partner. Scoot your chair back.\u000a  Prevents the other wildlife near the rivers. Therefore, we should not build any more dams. Instead, we should use solar energy, or energy from the sun, to produce electricity. This will help us protect our wildlife and enjoy the natural beauty around us.\u000a  Hmm, which of the five text structures?\u000a  We think it's problem solution.\u000a  Problem solution, correct. Give yourself 500 points\u000a  Because it said problem in there.\u000a  All right, what would the guys like? Hey.\u000a  Sorry. Zach, what do you want?\u000a  They did text structure 500. It'll pop up yellow after I click on the next one.\u000a  Vocab for 500.\u000a  Vocab for 500. Want to read that one, Zach?\u000a You should take some time to ponder the question before writing your response.\u000a  Hmm, what does ponder mean?\u000a  You think.\u000a  Ahh, perfect. To think about. Give yourself 500 points. All right, what would the gals like?\u000a  Should we try the Confucius question?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  For 500.\u000a  Okay, Confucius says for 500. And Marissa can read this one.\u000a  Confucius says, "A beautiful sunset is treasure for the eyes."\u000a  This is one of the five text structures.\u000a  Description?\u000a  Yeah, description.\u000a  Description, very good. And I'll just set these out. I got something that might help you guys, since a lot of these have them, you just kind of have your choices right there. What would the guys like? Very good.\u000a  Text features.\u000a Text features 500.\u000a  Text features 500.\u000a Which text feature is an alphabetical listing of subjects, people, and places you find in a book? Index, table of contents, title.\u000a  What do you guys think? Alphabetical listing.\u000a What do you think, Zach?\u000a Index.\u000a  Index.\u000a  Index would be correct. Good job, guys. What would the gals like?\u000a  Oh, 500.\u000a  Yeah, I just did that 500.\u000a  Should we text features for 400?\u000a  400, okay. All right, Judy can read this one.\u000a  What text feature gives definition for vocabulary words?\u000a  Wait, what is it? Wait.\u000a  Yeah, what do you mean for that?\u000a  Oh, I didn't, that one doesn't have the choices like the other one did. It would be an index, a glossary, or a title.\u000a  Glossary.\u000a  Glossary is correct. I put the choices on the other ones. I just must have missed that one. Very good. All right\u000a  Confucius says for 400.\u000a  Confucius says for 400. Could you go for Mrs. Lloyd's for just a couple minutes? Okay.\u000a  I wanna go tell Mr. Debush.\u000a  That's all right. I'll just get you guys a pass here in just a second. We'll do a couple more questions here. All right, whose turn to read?\u000a  It's Zach's.\u000a  Zach's turn? Okay.\u000a  Confucius say, "First feed the lion, "then enter cage."\u000a  Hmm.\u000a Sequence.\u000a  Sequence? Do you agree with him?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Yes, very good. Sequence. All right, what would the gals like?\u000a  What one did they do?\u000a  They just did the Confucius says for 400.\u000a  I want to do that one for 400 or for 300, right?\u000a  I think, yeah.\u000a Confucius says 300? Okay.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Okay, all right.\u000a Oh man, basketball.\u000a  Whose turn to read?\u000a  Confucius says, "Net in soccer "is much larger than net in basketball."\u000a  Compare and.\u000a  Yeah, compare and contrast.\u000a  Very good. All right, so they did this one, Zach. What would you guys like?\u000a  You want to do vocab for 400?\u000a  Vocab for 400.\u000a Yeah, vocab.\u000a  Vocab for 400? Okay.\u000a  Many professional golfers first began playing as amateurs.\u000a  Very good. Just a second. What do you think?\u000a  First players.\u000a  Okay, the first players. You're exactly right.\u000a Oh, my gosh.\u000a People who have done something for the first time and they don't get paid. They're amateurs. All right, what would the gals like? They did vocab.\u000a  Structure.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Structure 400?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  They want the big point ones.\u000a  Is it my turn?\u000a  Yeah, I think so.\u000a  Living in the country is very different than living in the city. A city dweller need to be careful of traffic and other people. In the country, there are fewer cars and people. In the city, many people can walk to the movies, stores, and other activities. In the country, people must drive to get to places.\u000a  Compare and contrast.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  Compare and contrast? And she agrees. Very good. All right, what would the guys like?\u000a What do you want, Zach? Vocab for 300.\u000a  Vocab for 300.\u000a Oh, it's your turn, Zach.\u000a I depleted my savings when I bought my new basketball shoes.\u000a What do you think?\u000a  Hmm, what do you think? One for depleted.\u000a  Oh, I know this one.\u000a Drained?\u000a  Drained, yep. Empty, gone, you used all your savings. And basketball shoes can cost a lot of money, so I can see that happening. What would the gals like?\u000a  Confucius, oh wait, no, no, no. Did they do text structure 300?\u000a  Nope, he just did the vocab.\u000a  Okay, I want to do text structure for 300.\u000a  Features for 300?\u000a  No, text structure.\u000a  Oh, text structure. I can go back. Structure for 300.\u000a  The eye is made up of many parts. The white part of the eye is called the\u000a  Sclera.\u000a  sclera, and the colored part is called the iris. The iris comes in many colors, including brown, blue, green, and hazel. The iris is covered with the cornea, which is clear and round. Description.\u000a  Do you agree?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a I should know about the eye, because my stepmom's a, she works at the eye company.\u000a  Wait, did we just pass text features?\u000a  Oh she does? They just.\u000a

V  We have been talking about being a good speaker and a good listener. And in class, your teacher had you do an activity in your classroom where you sat across the way from a student and you read them a paper that you had written about dingoes. And then you had to stand up in front of the class and you had to present that. Do you remember that? Okay. So we talked about what it sounds like to be a good speaker and what it looks like to be a good listener, and your teacher and I worked on a rubric, and you got a grade for some different things about speaking. Do you remember what any of those things were that you got a grade on? Do you remember what she was looking for?\u000a Posture.\u000a  Posture. What do you mean by posture?\u000a Not moving around.\u000a  Okay. So when you're standing up in front of the class, what would you look like?\u000a Standing straight.\u000a  Okay.\u000a Not leaning against the wall.\u000a  Okay, good. Do you remember what else we talked about being a good speaker looks like?\u000a Voice.\u000a  Okay. What about your voice? What should your voice do?\u000a Use your presentation voice.\u000a  Yeah, like a presentation voice. Does it sound like this? What does a presentation voice sound like?\u000a Kind of loud, but not like an outside voice.\u000a  Yeah, kind of loud, but not screaming, right? I like how you said not an outside voice. All right. What else for speaking? Do you remember what else?  One of them, I know, didn't really have to do with speaking, but it had more to do about your report. And it was did your report make sense? Right? Did what you write make sense? What about if I read my report really slow? Is that good?\u000a I can't remember...\u000a  It starts with an "F". Fl-...\u000a Fluency.\u000a  Fluency. Good. And what does that mean?\u000a You're not reading slow or too fast.\u000a  Good, not too slow, not too fast, just right. Okay. So we have posture, voice, makes sense, fluency, do you remember what the last one was? You're not doing it right now.\u000a Eye contact.\u000a  Good. All right. You want to make eye contact, right. Right. So when you're reading, you want to be able to do what?\u000a See the people.\u000a  Yeah, look at the audience, right? Kind of look over your paper and make eye contact with people. Okay, now, if I'm a good listener, if I'm the person sitting in the audience, how can I show my classmates that I'm being a good listener?\u000a No distractions.\u000a  Okay. So, don't distract them. What else?\u000a Don't be distracted by someone else.\u000a  Okay.\u000a \u000a  So you want to focus on the speaker. All right. How can you show them that you're focused on them. How would they know?\u000a Look at them.\u000a  Yeah, look at them. Right? Okay, look at the speaker. And what else? What about at the end, when they're done?\u000a Ask questions.\u000a  Good. Ask questions. Anything else?\u000a Sit up straight.\u000a  Okay. Good. Could you tell them, maybe, how they did? What do we call that? Like feedback? What they did well on, or maybe what they could do better? Right? Okay. Put a star next to the ones that you think you already do a good job at. What do you think you do a good job at? Okay. You're focused on the speaker. All right, you sit up straight. Okay. You don't distract others. That's good. Okay. Now, out of these two, which one do you think you need to work on? Which one could you do a better job? That one. Okay. So maybe you could ask more questions at the end? Okay. All right. What about speaking? Which ones do you think you do a good job at already?\u000a Posture.\u000a  Okay. You do a good job on that one.\u000a Make sense.\u000a  Mm-hmm.\u000a Eye contact.\u000a  Mm-hmm. Okay, so out of your voice and fluency, which one do you think you could do better? Which one could you work on?\u000a The voice.\u000a  Voice. All right. So what do you think you need to do better with your voice?\u000a Speak up louder.\u000a  Speak up louder? Maybe a little bit closer to, like, that presentation voice. Okay. On your rubric, it was what, five, four, three, two, one? Do you remember what you got on your volume?\u000a Three.\u000a  A three, okay. So Miss Welch thought you could do a little better too, so maybe next time you could get a four or a five. Okay. So we have been talking about famous African Americans, and you had said that Walter Payton was somebody that you had thought was interesting. Right? All right. So we are going to look at some information about Walter Payton, and then, see if we can maybe do better on asking questions, and maybe, working on your volume. Okay?\u000a Cool.\u000a  Okay. So, Austin, the other day, you and I met and we did a videotape of ourselves giving a little speech about Walter Payton, and the first one was I was speaking and you were videotaping me. And then we flipped it, and I videotaped you. So what I want to do is have us watch those and see how they turned out. And then we're going to use this rubric that you use in your classroom to kind of grade ourselves and see how we did and talk about what we can do better in the future. Okay? So we looked up some facts about Walter Payton, and let's watch my speech first. And I want you to be thinking about while you watch me, how did I do on eye contact? How did I do on my volume? How was my fluency? Did it make sense? And how was my posture? Okay, on a scale of one to five, five being, "Woo-hoo, Miss Suzer, you did a great job," and one meaning, "Miss Suzer, I didn't even see that at all." Okay? All right, you ready? All right. Let's see how I did. Walter Payton was one of the best running backs in the NFL. He played for the Bears after going to college in Mississippi. Sweetness has over 110 questions. But he died in 1999 of liver cancer. He's one of the best football players of all time. I wish I could have seen him play. He was my favorite football player. All right. So let's see. What do you think? Do you want to use purple or blue? You want to be purple? Okay. So how do you think I did on eye contact? What do you think? You think a four? Okay, why do you think a four? Did I give much eye contact?\u000a No.\u000a  No? Oh, you're saying yes? I only saw myself look up once, so I'm going to give myself a two. I don't think I did a very good job. You're too nice. Alright. How was my volume? Pretty good? Okay. I think I'll agree with you there. How was my fluency or my rate? Good? Okay. I think I'm going to give myself a four because there were kind of parts where I thought maybe I could have talked a little faster. I don't know. All right. Did it make sense what I said? Yeah? Okay. And how was my posture? Was I standing up straight, looking ahead. Okay. I wasn't like swaying or rocking or anything? All right, so it looks like, overall, I think I need to do better on eye contact. And you thought I could probably do a little better on eye contact. And I think I could do a little better on my fluency. I think I could have maybe spoke a little bit faster. It sounded like I was kind of in slow motion. Okay. So now, let's watch how you did. And then we'll grade you. Okay? All right, so here you are.\u000a .\u000a  Okay. Let's see. All right. How do you think your eye contact was? A one? Why did you give yourself a one?\u000a Because I didn't really look up.\u000a  You didn't look up at all, did you? Were you looking at your paper? What were you concentrating on?\u000a Paper.\u000a  The paper? Okay. Yeah, I would say, it would be good, maybe, if you held your paper down at your belly button, right, and then you could look up. All right. How was your volume? Not evident? Okay. I'm going to give you a two and a half for your volume because we could kind of hear you. I think the reason we couldn't hear you is because you had the paper in front of your face. I think your voice might have gone out a little bit more. All right. How was your fluency, or your rate? What do you think?\u000a I didn't hear myself at all.\u000a  Okay. All right. I thought it wasn't bad at all. I thought it was pretty good because when I could hear you, I thought it was probably like a three and a half or a four. You weren't reading really fast. You were reading so that I could understand you. It was just kind of hard to hear. All right. Do you think your facts made sense? Why did you give yourself a two?\u000a I don't know. I had some  in there and... I don't know.\u000a  All right. Because you could only hear parts of it? You think if your volume had been better, you could have heard more? Okay. All right. I'm going to give you a four because I think it made sense. All right. What about your posture? How was your posture? Man, you're being hard on yourself. Why did you give yourself a one?\u000a Because I wasn't, I was like...\u000a  Wiggling around a little bit?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Okay. Well, I'm not going to be that hard. I'm going to give you a three. Okay, so if we were going to do this again, maybe in front of your class, or in front of your teacher, or something, what would you do differently next time? Now that you've seen yourself, what would you do differently? Maybe the things you got ones on, right? Okay. So, maybe looking up, over your paper. Maybe your volume. Yep. Maybe working on your fluency or your rate, maybe a little faster, right? What about your posture, what would you do differently?\u000a Stand straight.\u000a  Okay. Try to stand still. All right. So, it looks like we have a couple things we could work on, right, for next time. Okay. Sounds good.\u000a

V Welcome to Mrs. Dunford's first grade classroom. Here you see a Word-Work center, where students are working to build words. All around the room, student work is proudly displayed along with anchor charts to anchor student learning. At Computer Center, students are working on differentiated computer programs based on needs. At Listening Center, students listen to stories to build their fluency. Above them is our Word Wall, which displays our sight words. Our Center Chart. The students are working on the Smart Board to integrate technology into reading. Here we have students at Read To Someone, where they are enjoying reading books to each other. Around the back of our room, books are separated into book bins for genres and they have their book boxes. At Read To Self area, students read independently and enjoy reading in our tent. In the back, we have our marble jar for compliments and our How Was Your Day board, along with our Helper Chart. And last we have My Table, where I work with small groups based on needs. Thank you for joining our classroom.\u000a Okay boys and girls, we just read the biography by Maurice Sendak. Can you tell me what is a biography? Let's see...

So can you move "Kenny's Window" to Books?\u000a Yep.\u000a You've got to touch it a little bit harder.\u000a I got it.\u000a Okay, good job. Right there, Dylan, is good. Thank you, Dylan. It's good there. I'll move it up a little bit further. There now it's out of the way.\u000a Can I do this?\u000a Okay, you want to do the disco ball?\u000a  \u266b That's the way, uh huh uh huh \u266b \u266b I like it, uh huh uh huh \u266b \u266b That's the way, uh huh uh huh \u266b \u266b I like it, uh huh uh huh \u266b\u000a  Good. Let's look at the last one. "Liked bedtime stories." Can you read it with me?\u000a  "Liked bedtime stories."\u000a Where would that one go? Let's see... Cassandra?\u000a  Childhood.\u000a Childhood? Why do you think that it would go in Childhood?\u000a  Because his grandpa and grandma read him some stories.\u000a  Because they read him stories, didn't they? Good job. That completes our graphic organizer on Maurice Sendak. Now, I have your own biographies for you to read. Everyone should know where they go. And your own shoe biography for you to fill out because remember we're going to do a display in our hallway that's called Famous Footwear and have our shoes displayed for everyone else to see. Alright, right now I want you to stand up. I want you to glue cotton on your shoes.  Stick some marshmallows in your mouth, and go to your area to read your biography.  \u000a  Alright, I want you to sit a little more in a circle and then I want you to read two pages and then I want you to fill it out, okay?  Can you read the title? Can we read the title together? Ready?\u000a  "Joseph Burcheck"\u000a Good. Who's Joseph Burcheck?\u000a Him.\u000a Yep, that's right. Open up to page two, Dalton. There you go. Stephanie, can you start for us?\u000a "Joseph Burcheck" grandma and grandpa . There were lots of beautiful plants and hills where they live."\u000a "Grandma had many books she liked to read and so did Joseph."\u000a  Good. Stop there and look at your graphic organizer. Look at your shoe. Is there a part of that shoe that you can fill out?\u000a Yes.\u000a Which part do you think? You think Family? And you think Childhood, Dalton. Let's start with Family. What part do you think would go in Family?\u000a Grandma and grandpa.\u000a Grandma and grandpa. That he did what with Grandma and Grandpa?\u000a Read books.\u000a He read books with them. What else did he do with them? Can you re-read this part?\u000a "There were a lot of beautiful plants and hills where they lived."\u000a "They lived." What do you think that means? That he what with his Grandma and Grandpa?\u000a Lived.\u000a He lived with them, that's right. So can you write that in Family? Put that in Ideas. And then let Dalton tell you what he thinks goes in Childhood, okay?\u000a Got it. \u000a  What do you guys filling in? \u000a How do you spell "lived?"\u000a  L...\u000a No, lived.\u000a  L-I... V-E-D.  Who does his live with?\u000a He cheated.\u000a  Grandma and Grandpa.\u000a His Grandma and Grandpa? Is that what you were going to add to the graphic organizer? You're exactly right. You're doing a good job. Jenn, I think she needs the marker. There you go. Keep it up. Keep up the good work.\u000a  H-E R-A-N  \u000a  "Her family was quick to hang up her work." Your turn.\u000a  "Her family was quick to hang up her work."\u000a  Nice job. And we have a Family section on here, so what do you think Dylan? What did her family do?\u000a  Put her pictures up.\u000a That's exactly right, they "hung up her work." Good job Dylan. I'm going to show you where. Right here. T-H-E\u000a Do you know why they're putting that in Family? Can you tell me? Because her family did what? What did her family like to do?\u000a Put pictures up.\u000a Hang up her pictures, that's exactly why they're adding it to Family.\u000a  Go ahead and finish what you need to write.\u000a  You've got to finish it, Dylan. You're doing a great job.\u000a  There you go, her work. \u000a Why is this a biography?\u000a  Because it tells by a... girl and she's writing books. And she was reading books and writing.\u000a You're right, it's a biography. A biography is a story about a real person and that's exactly what she was. Can you read me one of these?\u000a "When Amy was little, she liked to read."\u000a  Good. And why does that belong in Childhood?\u000a Because she was doing it as a child.\u000a  She was doing it when she was little. You're right. You're exactly right. Now, who's going to fill in the ideas? Who knows where did she get her ideas from? Do you know where she got her ideas from?\u000a  From the books.\u000a From the books. Well, actually, where did she get the ideas for the books? Can you read this part for me?\u000a "Amy liked  about a lot of books. Things people say help Amy."\u000a What helps Amy?\u000a "Things people say."\u000a Things people say. So where does she get her ideas from?\u000a People.\u000a People and the things that they tell her, right? Things that they say. Can you write that in the Ideas part?\u000a Yes.\u000a Good job. The things that people say are what help her and give her ideas. Houston, can you help her direct that? That would be great. You guys are doing a fantastic job. \u000a  Oh, you wrote the wrong stuff. You're writing on the wrong side. You're writing on the wrong side. \u000a She's writing that whole section. Why? Can someone tell me why she's writing that in Childhood? Clint, do you know? Why is she writing that in Childhood? Why is she writing that Joseph did things with his Grandpa in Childhood?\u000a  Because he used to watch him play guitar and go in the woods with him and talk nice--\u000a Did he do that when he was an adult or when he was a child?\u000a Child.\u000a Right, so is that why it would go in Childhood?\u000a Yes.\u000a Jeffrey, can you tell me what is this story about?\u000a  It tells real stuff.\u000a  It tells real stuff about what?\u000a Joseph Burcheck.\u000a Joseph Burcheck, yep. That's what it does. It tells real things about him. You guys are doing great. Keep up the good work.\u000a

V Who's gonna do the skyscraper?\u000a So we got to put size, color, and shape.\u000a Size, color, and shape.\u000a Ok, I'm gonna do a skyscraper\u000a Beau, is that for the past or the present?\u000a That's for the present.\u000a Skyscraper?\u000a  Present, the present.\u000a  The present, ok.\u000a  And the pyramid is for the past.\u000a  Yeah\u000a  And you'll do a pyramid for the past?\u000a  I was gonna do a log cabin.\u000a That's what I was gonna do.\u000a  But we have to use different things because we don't got no logs.\u000a  Well, actually, they still make log cabins now.\u000a  We can use brown for the logs.\u000a  Jonathon says they still make log cabins now.\u000a  They do.\u000a  Yeah, they do.\u000a  We don't really make pyramids any more, do we?\u000a  No.\u000a  Yeah, but they could be hidden in Egypt.\u000a  Yeah, but there is four lines. What we gonna do with the other two?\u000a  What I want you to do is list three details.\u000a  Color, size, and shape.\u000a  So, what shape will your skyscraper probably be? \u000a  A rectangle! A rectangular prism.\u000a  A rectangular prism? That's what Dillon said.\u000a  Rectangle\u000a  Rectangular Prism\u000a  Okay.\u000a Then you can talk about your pyramids. Ask them, they're your team.\u000a  A square pyramid.\u000a  Triangle\u000a  Oh, he said a square pyramid.\u000a  Yeah, let's do it.\u000a  A triangle.\u000a  You think it should be a triangular pyramid?\u000a  Yeah, I'm with Dillon.\u000a  Well talk about it. Which one do you want to do?\u000a  I thought square pyramid was more like a real pyramid. You know, because it has four sides?\u000a  It does have four.\u000a  A pyramid only has four sides.\u000a  Well a triangle has four, too.\u000a  It does?\u000a  One, two, three, four.\u000a  That's a square, honey, because it has four. Well, if it has three sides, how many sides does it have?\u000a  Three.\u000a  Three. So, you have to decide.\u000a  So, we could take a square and make it like a ...\u000a  Dillon agrees a square pyramid,too. I love having y'all together.\u000a  Let's do square pyramid and rectangular prism.\u000a  Good deciding.\u000a Alright.\u000a What are you guys discussing, right now?\u000a We're discussing what all we wanna do.\u000a I like that. Okay.\u000a  We're not sure what play we're doing?\u000a  You're not sure what play you wanna do?\u000a  Because everybody keeps picking everything.\u000a  So, how are we gonna figure it out?\u000a  But I agree with Randy.\u000a  So, what do you guys agree on?\u000a  I agree with my plans.\u000a  He wants like an old time car, and I don't agree with that.\u000a  But, we don't understand how you do an old time car.\u000a  How do you do a play, or skit, about an old car? That's what you need to tell them.\u000a The only time -- \u000a  Okay.\u000a  Aaron said something about the classroom and that I was going to be the teacher. Or something like that.\u000a  I wanna be assistant teacher.\u000a  Randy likes that.\u000a  And this is two people from the past and two people from the present.\u000a  Hear what Jacob said.\u000a  Jacob wants to be assistant teacher.\u000a  You're the teacher, assistant teacher.\u000a  So when will that be in the past or the present?\u000a  Present!\u000a  Haley could be a teacher from the present and then me and Randy can be from the past and then they can be from the present too. And then we'll come to where they are, then they'll have to show us what changed.\u000a  Did y'all hear Aaron's idea? You can say that to them.\u000a  I like Aaron's idea.\u000a  Listen to what Aaron just said guys. He has an idea that you may want to do.\u000a  Ian and Jacob and Haley are from the present. And me and Randy are from the past and we come. And, they show us all the stuff that has changed.\u000a  I agree with Aaron. I agree with Aaron.\u000a  I agree with Aaron.\u000a  Or we could do, like, you two are teachers and like me and Aaron and Ian are like students. And then, them two teach us.\u000a  Oh, that's an idea. You could do...\u000a  But then how do we do the past?\u000a  Well, but you could do the past and then, how, could you do a skit about the past, and a skit about the present?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  They would be the same except one is the past and one is the present.\u000a  To where like, no one had desks and then in the present we have desks.\u000a  Oh. What do you think, Ian?\u000a  I wanted to do people from the past and future they all meet together and do things from the past and the future.\u000a  Well are we doing the future or the present?\u000a  Present\u000a  Well then people from present and past and they do things from the past and the present.\u000a Okay. Well, decide. It sounds like you got some really good ideas.\u000a  Why can't we just do one if they are doing stuff from the past and the present? And you choose your own people who live in the present.\u000a  Well, Ian, if your working in a group should everybody do their own thing or should we work and kind of come up with the same idea?\u000a  Yeah, you choose your own people but you do it in the present.\u000a Sounds like y'all have to just keep on. You may just have to make a decision. Ok? You may just have to make a decision. Sounds like you are doing great, guys.\u000a  How do you spell transfer trucks?\u000a  Huh?\u000a  How do you spell transfer trucks?\u000a Transfer trucks? Let's sound it, let's tap it. What letters?\u000a  T\u000a  Trrr\u000a  A- N- C- E- R, or something.\u000a  Trr, like tree.\u000a  T- R\u000a You got it, Shannon. Did you hear Shannon? Let's tap it, Ta'jarius. Trr..Aaa...\u000a  A\u000a What letter is that? Nnnn\u000a  N\u000a Ssss\u000a  C, K.\u000a  S\u000a  Ssss, Transssss\u000a  S\u000a  I got S.\u000a  F\u000a  F. How do you make "er' at the end of a word?\u000a  E.R.\u000a You got it. There you go, and you know trucks. So, what are y'all doing with transfer trucks?\u000a  I don't know. He's the one who wanted to write it.\u000a  Why was this on Noah's desk?\u000a  Case has some names.\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Ok, but what... But why did y'all, um You're describing what each persons' job will be. And I have that, "Noah and Ta'jarius and Madison are gonna" do what?\u000a  The waves.\u000a  What kind of waves? What are y'all showing from the past and the present?\u000a  I wanna do waves in the present.\u000a  Do waves change from the past to the present? Do you mean like ocean waves? Have those changed over time?\u000a  I'm doing transfer trucks.\u000a  What's it suppose to be?\u000a  A.\u000a  I'm doing transfer trucks.\u000a  How have those changed over time?\u000a  Horses carried them, with like, umbrella's over them.\u000a  Very cool. And we saw that kind of wagon on the smart board earlier. And you said that was like a truck.\u000a  You could pull that up, back up there.\u000a  I could pull it back up. Do you wanna see that again? Cash, do you wanna do the illustrations for the trucks over time? Shannon, what are you doing? What are your illustrations gonna be, showing change over time?\u000a  She might do cars or something.\u000a  Do you wanna do cars?\u000a  You don't have to do cars.\u000a  You don't want to?\u000a  Lots of things have changed over time. \u000a  You can actually buy food and not hunt it.\u000a  How do you spell Shannon?\u000a That's one of the things you could draw the change from the, maybe you'll do washing machines?\u000a  Yeah. Yeah, that works.\u000a  Yeah. Cars change.\u000a Do you wanna do transfer trucks?\u000a  No. You're already doing them.\u000a  Guys!\u000a Do you wanna do washing machines, Madison? Draw a washing machine next to that?\u000a  You wanna do washing machines?\u000a  Can you hold that up so they can see it? because Shannon can't see it.\u000a Where did ya wash your clothes at?\u000a Turn it over like this, and you'd rub them against here.\u000a Different, isn't it?\u000a Yeah.\u000a When I was little, my great- great- great- great- great- great- great- grandma, grandfather he had a washing board he took a picture of and then when I was big I was allowed to see it.\u000a Very cool. There was a picture. Alright. It sounds like you've got some work to do guys. I love the idea of showing the illustrations of the trucks over time and the cars over time. I think we need to think about waves, though, because waves are a natural thing. People don't really build and change those, do we? No, so we need to think about something that has changed over time. And don't forget our books--\u000a  Buildings! Buildings!\u000a Buildings have definitely changed over time. Alright guys. Keep it up you are doing great. Alright, let's see what you guys are up to. Okay, what's going on over here?\u000a  Well, we're thinking about--\u000a  About Cassa coloring, Ann coloring, and me coloring and drawing, and her drawing.\u000a  I love drawing.\u000a  You love drawing.\u000a  That's what I love. I love typing at home. I love all of it.\u000a  Very cool. Alright, so what kind of things are you gonna show how are you gonna show past to present with your clothing?\u000a We're gonna show the style, the color...\u000a  Okay, can you tell me what you're gonna draw?\u000a  We're gonna draw dresses.\u000a  Oh, dresses.\u000a  And shoes. Like, dresses and the shoes that they would wear.\u000a  I can get my old dress, My mom's old dress she's got, I have it, and I can design it.\u000a You can?\u000a  Uh-huh. \u000a So are you all four going to show dresses from the past and present?\u000a Yes.\u000a Or are some of you gonna do past and some of you do present?\u000a We're gonna do it all together.\u000a I love that.\u000a Them two are coloring, I'm coloring, and me and her are drawing.\u000a Very nice.\u000a You're drawing?\u000a Yes, we're drawing, I'm coloring.\u000a Very, very nice. Well, it looks like you guys are ready for your next page. Let me ask you this, how has clothing changed over time?\u000a The color has definitely changed.\u000a The colors have changed?\u000a And the shoes.\u000a  Ladies used to wear long dresses and now they wear not that long of dresses.\u000a Oh, so they used to wear really long dresses and now...\u000a  They have short dresses that come up to here.\u000a  Yeah, and shoes they wear lace-up boots\u000a  Laced-up boots\u000a I think my mama has them, I won't be able to wear them, but I might be able to bring them.\u000a Oh, that'd be cool if you bring those. It sounds like you have great ideas.\u000a And they wore hats back then. \u000a 'cause I'm thinking about my mom's dress... I mean, I can design it.\u000a I am very, very pleased with how much you've accomplished together in your group, let me get you the next sheet.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  We all have our things done and we're going to get it.\u000a And we all have each others' phone numbers.\u000a Here's the next sheet. Let's look for a second. "Who will design the piece from the past?" and, "Who will design the piece from the present?" Now that doesn't mean it has to be separate. Right, you can take it home.\u000a  Well, me and her...\u000a Well, it sounded like we're all, okay?\u000a  Yeah, we're all basically doing it.\u000a Okay, "Why is this change important to people today?" and, "How could this continue to change in the future?" Hmmmm. There's some questions to think about.  So have you worked on this some more? You've decided to what you're gonna do? Skyscrapers and pyramids.\u000a They're doing the pyramids, me and him is doing the skyscrapers.\u000a Them two are doing the pyramids, we're doing the skyscrapers.\u000a That was nice. Good going, coming up with that. Good job.\u000a We're doing a square pyramid.\u000a  You're doing a square pyramid?\u000a Yeah.\u000a That's easy, all you gotta do is start out as a square and draw triangles at the top.\u000a So when I was with you before you said this is hard, we don't know what we're gonna do and all had different ideas, and as it turns out this is kind of easy. What made it easier?\u000a  Working as a team!\u000a Working as a team.\u000a Dillon, would you mind sitting over here, sweetie, so that everybody can hear and see what you're doing?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Kinda off by himself over there, huh, sweetheart. Alright, the last thing you need to fill out on your papers is "How has this changed over time?" Buildings, how have buildings changed over time?\u000a Pyramids, pyramids been tooken down.\u000a Did we ever build buildings out of gold?\u000a No.\u000a I got something. Pyramids have been tooken down to make more space in Eygpt, like more land.\u000a  Okay. \u000a What about buildings in general? How is this building different from McWilliams?\u000a  It's bigger!\u000a It's bigger and has more space.\u000a Which one is bigger?\u000a  McWilliams!\u000a  And it's newer.\u000a It's newer, so how do you--\u000a It's newer or it's smaller?\u000a He says it's newer.\u000a

V  ...so you can't count it out completely.\u000a  Hmm. So we have three things going on here. I hear exponential decay, I hear an upside-down parabola, and I hear a negative-sloping line. Red, why don't you chime in? I haven't heard from you. Are you going with decay? Are you going with decreasing line? You going with upside-down parabola? What had you guys decided?\u000a We were going to go with decay but...\u000a  You were going to go with decay, okay\u000a But, I changed my mind because decay, it keeps decreasing all the way. But MySpace, it got to a point where it stopped decreasing... and it was  like what Rosetta said.\u000a  So it stopped decreasing, which is what you're saying, and you're saying that's in agreement with Rosetta. I have a serious issue with a line stopping. Can somebody talk to me about that? I have a serious issue with a line stopping or having some kind of decrease that then slows itself.\u000a It's the end of the line. Slows itself. Colin, I haven't heard from you.\u000a I don't think it's linear because the linear is going to signify that at one point there are going to be no users or people on MySpace. I agree with Elsie that it might be decay because it decreased, but decay doesn't ever touch the X-axis, which would signify there are no users.\u000a  Ah!\u000a And there will always be users.\u000a  Oooh, what's somebody thing about that? Really, really, really significant comment that was just made by Colin. What do we think? The fact that it's never going to... how did you say it?\u000a I said that the linear was going to, at one point, to hit zero, and with decay it's never going to hit zero. It's going to get really close but not touch it.\u000a  Jeffrey.\u000a I agree with Colin. Because if it was a negative line, like a negative line, right? You're going to go past zero, and you can't have a negative amount of users, 'cause a line keeps on going forever.\u000a  Ok, does exponential keep going forever?\u000a No. I mean yes! Yes, it does, but because it's so small that it never touches the X-axis, but it keeps on going so it just never hits zero.\u000a  So, if we all agree, are we getting closer to agreeing that it's exponential decay?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  If we are agreeing it's exponential decay, then what Jeffrey just said... what does that mean for MySpace the company? Will it go out of business?\u000a  no...\u000a  Based on what Jeffrey just said about an exponential decay, at the end. What does that mean for MySpace the company? What do you know about MySpace the company at this moment?\u000a It's still low. \u000a It's still low, but is it in existence?\u000a  Yes\u000a It is. Do you know what's keeping it You know?\u000a I think because you're always going to have that one user account \u000a  Ok, you might, you might always have that one user. There's something, though, that MySpace provides that other websites don't, that's very easy to do that other sites don't have. And this is what's keeping it from touching that X-axis. Do you know what it is? Alicia? Talk to us, I can't hear you.\u000a Music?\u000a  Yes, Alicia, who is in the band, would obviously know this, right? Tell them what you do on MySpace, Alicia.\u000a Bands can make pages and they can upload their songs and you can listen to them.\u000a  Yeah, you can upload your music on MySpace easier than any of the other sites. Very good, thank you for chiming in. Alright, let's shift gears from MySpace, now let's talk Twitter. Twitter, Twitter, Twitter. What do you think about the growth of Twitter? \u000a Alright, keywords. Red, start me off with keywords and then we'll bounce to Pink and around the room.  Give them your attention, ladies and gentlemen. Are you guys prepared and ready for Twitter?\u000a Rush\u000a  I'm sorry, rush?  Where, show me?\u000a It's missing...something there\u000a  What's your keyword?\u000a Rush\u000a It's in the middle of the sentence.\u000a  In the third sentence. Oh, rush, is that what you said? Ok, just speak up, I'm getting old, I can't hear.\u000a Growth continues steadily.\u000a  Okay... anything else?\u000a Yeah, but it's at the tweets.\u000a  This, the tweeted?\u000a Yeah.\u000a  It goes with this. Okay. So what do you guys pick for the growth? What function models Twitter's growth?\u000a Exponential growth.\u000a  You think it's exponential growth, as well? Alright, is there a team? Pink, you're up.\u000a I disagree with that. I think it's linear because it says that another keyword that they've given is with 40 million in May, that whole sentence right there.\u000a  Got it.\u000a That's like a slope, if you think about it. With 40 million in May, 2009, 6 months later 60 million, and then 80 million in May 2010. The slope, it would be 20 million. So it's linear. It's going positive slope. \u000a  Hmm... filling out those listening labs? Pink just gave some hard core evidence. Red, do you have a comeback? Or have they won you over? You have a comeback. Let's hear it, Lenny, what's your comeback?\u000a This can not be because  because it's going to get to a point where it's going to stop. It's not like we're going to take it like\u000a  Do you have a time machine? \u000a  Ok, so let's leave... Lenny, I think exponential growth isn't going to stop and I think a line isn't going to stop, right? And I think that, if we think about the future... I think that's what Star is maybe trying to do, is predict the future. We don't really know. But from the language here in your text, the information you do know, I think 40 million then is pretty concrete evidence of slope. Do you agree?\u000a yes\u000a  Yes? Anybody else want to chime in on this one that I haven't heard from? Maybe from... Elianna on Blue? Bleaker, I haven't heard from you. Carlia yet? What do you guys think? How 'bout anything you want to add about Twitter? Anything you want to add? Greg, go ahead.\u000a Well what Lenny was saying, I cannot beat and I agree with them. That's it.\u000a  Ok, thank you! Any...?\u000a I agree with Star because as you mentioned  what this does or hope is that they'll be able to Tweet via text messages. And that's something that Facebook didn't offer. So the more things that... the more things that Twitter puts out there the other social networks is going to increase.\u000a Ok, so as Twitter grows, you're saying the other networks might be slowed? Who though, is going to outperform it if it's a different type of graph? Who is going to outperform Twitter for sure, if Twitter is linear and the other one is a certain other graph we mentioned?  Facebook, right? Because Facebook is what?\u000a Exponential\u000a  Exponential. Very good. Ok! So let's go now to AIM. We're doing very well on time here. AIM. Who's going to start us off with AIM? Alright, Pink, you can start us off.  Keywords and reasoning, talk to me.\u000a Some key words we worked was AOL lost their dominance.\u000a  Lost their dominance. Okay? Yep?\u000a And then we put continuous fielding is growth today.\u000a  Okay.\u000a And we said that it was quadratic equations, because at one point it was really high, but then as time went by, it started decreasing, but then it started getting more popular again. Lately, teenagers liked using it, so it started going up again.\u000a  Ok. Is there another keyword up here that would help anybody? I think there's at least one more keyword that I haven't seen pointed up. Elianna?\u000a Is it comeback?\u000a Comeback? Where's comeback?  Beautiful. Made a comeback and maybe even one more thing a little earlier. Jermaine? Thank you. Sorry, say that again?\u000a Dominated\u000a  Dominated, very nice, Jermaine. So it started out dominating, then had to make a comeback. Does anybody want to add on to what Pink said about this being quadratic?\u000a Which way?\u000a  Which way?\u000a Would make it positive from earlier?\u000a  Positive what? Talk to me about the equation now.\u000a Quadratic is always going to...\u000a  Do quadratics always go up?\u000a  no, go down too, parabolic\u000a  This parabola? They always look like this?\u000a no\u000a  Think about inverses we learned through this year. Raise your hand and let me know what you want to say. Talk to me. Do parabolas always open upwards? Go ahead.\u000a  I just want to agree with them\u000a  You agree that it's a parabola?\u000a Yeah, because in a parabola... it says that it started off dominating, but you're on top if you're dominating. Then it said that it made a comeback. That means at one point it would have to be decreasing and then to make a comeback they come back, they come back up.\u000a  Beautiful. Wanna add to that? Go ahead.\u000a I was just going to say the other end \u000a Alright, so I just want to make sure I answered Purple's question in the back. You asked which way? Take a look at this. This is what you're talking about. Could the parabola be like this?  What would this mean if the parabola were down for the company?\u000a If it was down, then that means it's imaginary. Right?\u000a  You're thinking of something about imaginary and it's not if it's down. That has to do with a negative. Right, if there's a negative A coefficient. Something else, though. What would this mean for the company's trend? DeShawn? Go ahead, DeShawn\u000a They would have had a spiral at the bottom and then they would lift up\u000a  And come back down. Purple, are you alright with that now? You understand? This would not have worked based on what DeShawn just said. Here's my question for you on AOL. Why isn't AOL an absolute value graph? What starts high, comes down, and goes back up? We did do absolute value functions, right? Turn and talk first, and then you're going to tell me. Write that question down somewhere. I want to know why it's not an absolute value graph. \u000a Oh, yeah, we did talk about these today  \u000a if every five minutes they add ten members but every five minutes you're getting ten members then every five minutes you're gonna lose ten members so parabola is not possible  \u000a  Ok, guys... Bring it back. I want to know why isn't... Why didn't anybody say absolute value? I'm going to maybe put one over here, and then I have one more really important question about these graphs for you, and then we're in good shape. Absolute value... the reason I asked that is because that also starts high, comes down low and goes back up. I need some reasoning. Let's change it around, start with Gold and go around. Go.\u000a I don't think it's an absolute value graph even though it kind of follows the same kind of trend. Because in the absolute value, it's Y is equal to absolute value of X, meaning that as time passed, they would be losing and gaining a constant amount of people. So like, if you gained ten members every five minutes, every five minutes you would be gaining ten members no matter what. Every five minutes, or when it goes down, every five minutes you'd be losing ten members. Whereas a parabola that changes is not constant, you can lose and gain power then they'd be equal to join or don't join and you can't guarantee that you're going to gain that amount of members every time that amount of time passed.\u000a  So would it be fair to say it's too con-\u000a

V Take a look at that goal just to remind yourself whatever it is you're going to be working on. And this, we want to remind you that it's kind of dinner party conversation-ish. You agree with people at dinner parties. You disagree with people at dinner parties, but it's civil, because it's friends that you invited over to your house. You don't raise your, you don't raise your hand at dinner parties. You wait until, you wait until . You wait until someone else is finished speaking before you start speaking, of course, because that's polite dinner conversation. You add on to what one another says. But like I said, we don't necessarily have to agree. And then when the topic starts to die down at a dinner party, somebody else brings something else up. So you can raise your own questions as well. So the seminar is open, and my question to you guys is who you think is most to blame for the deaths that occurred at the end of "The Veldt."\u000a What did it mean, like, George having, like, I think that, I know a lot of times, where he, especially in the, towards the back, he... it goes back a little ways. He's, like, talking a lot of things, like, comments turning, comment, commen-, I can't say that word. He says they're going to turn the house down possibly for a month, and how he pick out the picture painter. And he was telling his, he was, like, talking to his son a lot and, like, about not, about doing what his son would not want to have happen, and how he spoiled his children so much. So he takes out, there's a lot of things that his son, his son and daughter, it just doesn't say as much, wouldn't like, because... yeah. But he wasn't, like, he wasn't, like...\u000a I agree that...\u000a "Oh yeah, I'm gonna go die today!"\u000a I agree that it was...\u000a He didn't want to die.\u000a I agree that it was...\u000a Of course he didn't want to die. Who wants to die? Except for if you're suici-, you know, suicidal.\u000a I agree that , and on Page 15, where it says, um, it's mostly on 16, but starts on Page 15. "Won't this house and this room replace you and your wife and your children's affections?" It assumes their mother and father grow more important in their lives than their real parents, and now you want to come along and shut it off? Kind of shows why that they hate them. And because it, because it's, since the nursery is their parents, it's like some guy who thinks he can tell you, coming along and can tell you to kill your parents, you know?\u000a It's the same thing as they're doing, though. They're killing their parents.\u000a Well...\u000a But they think the nursery is their parents.\u000a...they don't think their parents are their parents. They don't matter as much as parents.\u000a If they'd been nice to them, and now they're going to turn everything off, then isn't it imbalanced? So now they're relying on the house, because that's what they've learned to do, as...\u000a Yeah.\u000a It'd be like, take an example, people are killing their parents.\u000a And on Page 15, it says, like... I also think that it's, the dad says, "I sen-..." The psychologist says, "I sensed only that you had spoiled your children more than most, and now you're letting them die in some way." So if they, like, they don't really know, like, when someone says no to them, they've been spoiled so much they don't even, like...  well, they just can't take it. It makes them go all crazy and stuff. So they wanted to kill them, because they, like, couldn't fly to New York, so...\u000a Yeah. Because I think \u000a And if their parents, and if their parents, and if they felt that their parents were actually their parents, then maybe not. But since their parents don't really take care of them, it's the house that takes care of them.\u000a Yeah.\u000a And then the...\u000a The house and the room replaced their parents.\u000a Yeah. Their parents and friends.\u000a It's not like the parents could...\u000a They don't have friends, because they're, the room, they get all these adventures because of the room.\u000a Yeah.\u000a They don't have friends.\u000a And they kind of, like, rely on the house to give them stuff all the time.\u000a If the house refused them, if it could, then I don't think that they would want to kill it. I think that it's just because they don't feel like their parents are actually their, they don't, they feel, their parents aren't important to them. So when they say no...\u000a On page, on page 13, the mom's saying, "That sounds stressful. Would I have to tie my own shoes instead of letting the shoe tier do it? And brush my own teeth, and comb my hair, and give myself a bath?" The kid's, like, now relying on everything. He's never had to do something for himself. So he doesn't really, like, know.\u000a Yeah.\u000a He's gotten so, like, stuck on having everyone do things for him, he thinks, like, doing your own thing would be, like...\u000a A challenge.\u000a Yeah. Like, and I guess you can use an example as "Wall-E," a show. People get, like, so fat, and they rely on everything so much that, like, they have to move in chairs, and they, when you golf, it's virtual golf, there's a robot for you. So they just, they take robotics and machines to the next level, and they, it's all they rely on. And so many people don't have to work.\u000a Yeah, and weren't the ones that, like, bought the house, that they were actually the cause, because they were the ones ... like, on Page 5 and 11, they even said that, "We were the ones who bought the house. We were the ones who got us into this mess." So, but then all of a sudden they just took it away from their children, which made them mad. So again, they were the one who was causing all this madness in the house.\u000a I think it...\u000a Like, don't you think that people would be sort of obese, like Elliot said?\u000a Yeah. They would be.\u000a They would be.\u000a Yeah, but then they'd be like everyone else in the world.\u000a But then they also...\u000a Yeah, and...\u000a Getting exercise?\u000a But they're obese...\u000a And also, I think that it's George Hadley's fault, not necessarily both the parents, because the mom didn't really do as much. Because, like, well, the quote over there it said that, like, she's the one who let them in for a minute. But. . .\u000a She just wanted to be nice.\u000a She just wanted to be nice. But I think ... like on Page two, it says, "But nothing's too good for our children," George said. So I don't think it's as much Lydia's fault, because she also tries to get them out of the house instead of just staying there. She just wanted to be nice to the kids because George had shut it off so abruptly. But I think it's more George's fault that they spoiled them, and that therefore gets himself killed.\u000a Does anyone know when this story was written? Because I'm guessing it was...\u000a 1950.\u000a All right. Because I was, I'm guessing it was wri- I was, guessing it was written when women weren't, like, thought of that highly. Because Wendy only actually speaks once, and is a sniveling idiot most of the time. And Lydia's, and Lydia Hadley is pretty passive. And it's the guys that are, have all the action, and have anything really going on.\u000a Except in the final scene.\u000a Well, yeah. But that... she on-...\u000a She says one line. One line in the whole book, basically.\u000a I know, but Lydia sort of has a bit of action.\u000a Yeah, but...\u000a She doesn't do much. She doesn't, like... . .\u000a She's pretty passive.\u000a She doesn't, like, um, disagree with her husband or her kids. She doesn't do anything like that. She just follows whatever her husband says. Maybe she has a few opinions, but not really.\u000a And Wendy says four words alone in the whole thing, so...\u000a Well, I mean, you hear her screaming, but other than that...\u000a Is that a word?\u000a Well, that was \u000a Unless she's saying it...\u000a Close enough.\u000a...at the same time as Peter, like, when they both come in and say, "Hello, mom and dad"...\u000a Doesn't really count.\u000a...or when they both say, "Mommy, daddy, come quick." But she's saying it at the same time. She only says four words by herself in the entire story.\u000a The screams are actually their parents, when the kids were pretending in the nursery that their parents were being...\u000a Yeah, they realized that at the end, but they didn't really make that very clear. They're like, suddenly they realized why those screams sounded familiar. I thought the whole book, or the whole story, that it was, like, the kids' screams. But it's actually the parents.\u000a What are...\u000a Yeah, because it's really not clear on that. I figured that it's actually so they all .\u000a Well, I'm, it's more, it's nicer to have, like, a mystery, kind of.\u000a Mm-hmm. Yeah. I figured that it's the author's fault.\u000a The what?\u000a The author's.\u000a But...\u000a How is it the author's fault?\u000a Because it's his story.\u000a Well, the author wrote it.\u000a That doesn't make any sense.\u000a But Carl, the author .\u000a Yeah, that doesn't make much sense. It's not his fault. It's the... it's totally off topic.\u000a Yeah, I agree with Elise. When I didn't really get who the screams were until the very end, where they said, yeah, that... I think it's on Page... um, 19. But, yeah, that they were... it says on Page screamed, and suddenly they realized why those screams had sounded so familiar." So I thought it was the kids the whole time, I thought...\u000a Aaron was saying something before, but then everyone...\u000a What I was going to say is the, a little while ago, when I was going to ask you, why do people think it's, like, Peter Hadley or other... because, I mean...\u000a The other is both of them.\u000a Because more or less the majority did George Hadley. So why, just those people who did that, why did they do that?\u000a I understand with Peter Hadley, because it is his, he seems to have the main role of actually murdering the parents. But it's not his fault he got spoiled. He can't help it if his parents spoiled him.\u000a Yeah, because...\u000a Actually, even if the parents had been, played more of a parent role, they would still probably have preferred the nursery, because...\u000a You don't need to .\u000a...the parents could still say no, and the nursery does, they can, like, do whatever they want with it.\u000a I agree with the both parents part of it, even though the mom wasn't as involved as George was, the mother was not do-, posing a part in the kids' life as being the mom, and the house was. So that caused them to think the house was their parents, and the house was their family.\u000a This is... \u000a Indirectly... directly, I think...\u000a You can go.\u000a Directly, the, Peter was probably most responsible for the parents dying.\u000a Directly.\u000a Directly. But indirect... well, directly the lions were.\u000a Oh my God.\u000a Indirectly... but directly it was mostly Peter, but indirectly, it was, it was kind of everybody's fault.\u000a I kind of agree with, like, both the parents, and then the dad. Because in the beginning, the parents are, like, slowly taking away some things, like the painter, and not letting them go to New York. And that kind of builds up their anger. But in the end, the dad just wants to shut it all off. And then the son starts getting really mad and, like, threatening them, finally they, like, get really mad, and then they start imagining the parents dying, and then...\u000a They've been imagining the parents dying through the whole thing.\u000a I think it was the parents' fault, and the inventor. Because, I mean, none of it would have happened if they wouldn't have had the, just, like, the super technology house, and the nursery.\u000a So it's technology's fault.\u000a It's not the inventor's fault, because he didn't know.\u000a But it's not the, it's not the inventor's fault that they thought, though.\u000a If he wouldn't have made it, it would have never happened.\u000a And also, if the dad wouldn't have bought it, it would never happened, too. So that's my two opinions.\u000a They couldn't...\u000a But they bought it, but they made it and bought it to be a good thing, not a bad one.\u000a No one invented it so that you would, so that it'd be used as a murder machine. They didn't just make it, like, on the advertisement, "Greatest Murder Machine Ever."\u000a Perfect for murdering your parents.\u000a We don't know, like, why he built it. Maybe it was because of that, but you don't know, like, exactly what his point of the invention was.\u000a It was to, like, study the children's thoughts.\u000a It was to study their minds.\u000a Because the children...\u000a He said that, but what if it's not?\u000a He's a liar.\u000a The children were mentally impaired, and they needed to be looked up on, and they wanted to know what they were thinking, so ...\u000a So a psychologist .\u000a Another good quote to show that it was, to show that it might have, that it could have been the parents' fault, was that, on Page 11, it said... yeah, George said, "Who was it that... who was it said, 'Children are carpets. They should be stepped on occasionally.'" Because the parents didn't, they didn't do anything to the kids. They...\u000a They didn't really step on them that much until the end.\u000a They just did what they want.\u000a They just all of a sudden just, like, flattened them.\u000a Yeah, they just did it so abruptly.\u000a Yeah, they just started and let it go.\u000a It was just like, bam, you're dead.\u000a No wonder they wanted them dead.\u000a Guys, let's try and talk one person at a time, or else we can't hear.\u000a My turn. Okay. On Page 15, it says that the dad went from Santa, Santa to Scrooge. And, like, if he would have taken away, like, one thing at a time over a period of time, I don't think the kids would be, like, like, killing them. But it says he just took all the good stuff away at once, and they got, like, really mad.\u000a That's also kind of dangerous, though. Because they started getting mad at him as soon as they took away the picture painter. So it was, they still could've gotten mad. It's also more dangerous for the parents to actually slowly take them away, because they get more and more mad.\u000a All the anger...\u000a I have another opinion that I was trying to say, but then I let Fiona go first. That's not fair.\u000a No, that's not, it's my fault. \u000a All the anger built up because...\u000a Anyway, um...\u000a

V Viewing my art room from the front corner I have a storage area on the right hand side. Entry to the art room and paint storage is right by the door. Uh, a cart for paint supplies that can be wheeled out into the room. I have a large white cabinet for all of my paper and on the other side storage for student art work. I have a dry erase board, a digital white board and a bulletin board for instruction for students in the front of the room. We often sit right in the center of the room. There's also a birthday chair there for the birthday person to sit in. My tables are shaped around there in a U-shaped formation, each labeled by a colorful paint splot hanging from the ceiling. Indicating the table there's a red table, orange, yellow, green, blue and so forth. Each table has organized supplies in a painted shoebox and red caddies left on the tables. In the very back corner is the teacher desk. Two computers to the left of that as well as a laptop that's hooked up to the digital whiteboard. Across the back of the room I have work space for our student teacher and also to mount student art work, and store some ongoing large artworks. On the back wall I have more storage: metal cabinets, rolling cabinets and a light board that we can use to copy work from. And directly below me is our class pet this is where Shelly the turtle lives and she is currently hibernating.\u000a Like rabbits and dogs, dinosaurs. And kitty cats And puppies So first thing we are going to do today is look at pictures. Listen so that we have time for working. I need everyone to put in bubble. We are going to look at some pictures that artists have made long, long, long ago. The very oldest art in the whole world. Are horses and bulls inside of a cave. So the very first artists way back during cave people they were making art about animals. About horses and animals that ran around that they saw in their environment all around them. Put hands down, put hands down.\u000a ...dinosaurs ...yeah\u000a Well that was after the dinosaurs. But I'm looking for somebody that would be able to point out an animal that they recognize up here. Does anyone recognize some of those animals?\u000a Yeah\u000a Izaiah do you? Izaiah? Izaiah with a "Z." Do you want to go up and point? Come up and show us some animals that you recognize.\u000a Only animals who... only, only...\u000a Listen! She's the teacher right now. What's it?\u000a Kangaroo\u000a What else? Let her answer.\u000a Fish and turtle and, um, crocodile and a duck.\u000a Yeah and some kind of a bird. Good job. Did you notice that these are all made with dots? That's how some artists who live in Australia... Kimberly come right here in front of me... Turn around so you can see. That's how some artists in Australia make animals. And they kind of show what's inside of them, don't they? It's really good that you notice that, Izaiah. Do you have a comment?\u000a I know all those animals\u000a Good so you were naming them right along with her? Raiden, why is your name up, your hand up?\u000a You said last time we have to finish our .\u000a Oh we do have to finish those you're right. We will, don't worry. Okay. Next. What kind of animal is that?\u000a A horse.\u000a A horse. You know what it says at the top? It's a horse of a different color. Because what color is it?\u000a  Blue.\u000a Kind of like the "Wizard of Oz?"  right there. Why, boys and girls? Why is the horse blue? What do you think? Why is the horse blue?\u000a To make the horse beautiful!\u000a To make it beautiful? Why else would it be blue?\u000a Maybe because it... ?\u000aThere's another one.\u000a It's a unicorn horse isn't it? What? \u000aShhhh... what? I'm curious...\u000a Izaiah, why would an artist make a horse blue?\u000a Because it might be a unicorn.\u000a Well, it could be. Why?\u000a Because it might be a different kind of animal.\u000a Yeah, it might be a different type of animal horse.\u000a Have you ever drawn a picture and maybe just used your imagination? And used your favorite colors in it? How many people do that sometimes? I know I do. Sometimes I might make an animal but instead of making him brown, maybe I'll make him pink and purple and yellow.\u000a Ooooooh!\u000a And make him a little bit more imaginative.\u000a Sometimes at my dad's house all by myself.\u000a What else do we have?\u000a Another horse.\u000a Here's a fancy prancy horse. Now the other horse was kind of looking down, but what's this horse doing? What's this horse doing?\u000a Jumping.\u000a Flying.\u000a He's walking or galloping, isn't he? He looks... Look how he's standing. Look at the two horses. If you had to tell me how this horse is feeling...\u000a  Sad.\u000a Why do we think sad? Emma why do you think sad?\u000a Because he's looking down.\u000a He is looking down, isn't he?\u000a Maybe he's sad because his family just got killed by another animal.\u000a Oh, I hope that didn't happen. He could be sad about something that happened. What about this horse?\u000a  Happy!\u000a Why Melanie why do you think he looks happy?\u000a Because he still has a family of his own.\u000a Because why?\u000a Because he still has a family of his own.\u000a That's not why! That's not why!\u000a Izaiah, you might have a different idea than Melanie. Isn't it okay to have a different idea?\u000a Yeah\u000a So, I need you sitting, Kimberly and Regan, you both need to be sitting right here where you can see hun. Izaiah so it's okay to have... what was your idea about why he might be happy?\u000a Because he's walking and his family is going to get killed by a pack of animals.\u000a Oh my, but that wouldn't be very happy would it? You think he looks happy? Are there any other words you can think of to describe him? He's prancing around. Usually if you're in a bad mood do you walk around like this? With your head up?\u000a No.\u000a I used to do this, too.\u000a That's not prancing, that's stomping. But prancing is when you have your head up, isn't it? Kimberly! Kimberly! Right here. Come over here by me.\u000a Maybe... maybe he was doing this because  on his arm. There's something on his arm.\u000a Oh, it could be like a bandage, couldn't it? It might just be the way it's painted like his knees are a little bit lighter than the rest of him. Is that what you're noticing? What are you noticing?\u000a  but one of my family died\u000a Awww. That is sad, isn't it?\u000a Really really really old.\u000a  \u000a That happens sometimes, I'm sorry. \u000a ...family died in a fire...\u000a Guess what? Guess what?\u000a Shhhh... Kimberly if you want to earn your star card today you have to come sit by me. Brandon if you want to earn yours you have to be sitting on your bottom, not crawling on the floor.\u000a You have to color inside of it? \u000a You might want to draw his shell first to make it really big.\u000a Look at mine!\u000a Can I see?\u000a Good job! Make these lines really, really dark.\u000a Hey, look at my turtle.\u000a Go back over it like this.\u000a Boys and girls, if your paper's kind of  'cause you're pushing so hard then you're drawing dark enough. Okay, they should really be pressing hard with that. Good, go over it really really dark. That's dark enough. It looks great.\u000a Oh Kimberly yes.\u000a And put your name on the front with the crayon. Well look Izaiah, here's two choices for your shell. You can start with an oval like that or you can start like this. Okay. Yeah but I think two different ways see the top one and the bottom was a half circle. Which one do you like? Make it really big. Perfect! There you go! \u000a Look at my turtle.\u000a Boys and girls I want you to darken your lines and draw for at least five more minutes before you paint. Okay? Keep darkening your lines. Okay, darken those lines.\u000a We have to go and get our paint.\u000a Boys and girls, darken every line and I'm going to come around and as soon as I see that yours is nice and dark I'll put the paint on your table. Okay? This is yours? That's good, that's good. This is dark enough. What I want you to trace over is the black parts. And see these pencil lines? You have to trace over top of them. Or the paint will cover them up. So, what color would you like to use there? What color would you like to trace these in? Come pick a color. Come sit down. Tyler start working on your design. No, start working on your designs in the middle. That's perfect. Nice and dark. Boys and girls, see how dark these lines are? This is a really good example of how dark you want your crayon to be. You want to go back over it and trace it really dark. That one looks good, too. Nice and dark. That's awesome!\u000a Start drawing. \u000a I need yellow\u000a Boys and girls, would you put your name on...\u000a Pardon the interruption,  please come to the office.  please come to the office.\u000a Put your name right here. While you're getting ready to paint, put your name on the front in crayon. Nice and dark, write your name nice and dark with your crayon. Well, trace over it with the crayon.\u000a Look at mine.\u000a As soon as you're sitting down, Caitlin. I'm coming around to look. Boys and girls, when you're ready, you may put your hand up and I'll come around and check your pictures. You are ready. Yours looks really nice. Good! He made me draw it for you. Very good! \u000a Melody, I'm waiting for that hand to go up. Isaiah, ah! That looks great! While you're waiting for your paint, make those darker. \u000a Shhhh... Darken these a little bit.\u000a Izaiah what are you doing?\u000a Oh, I like your turtle. \u000a

V  That one hurts.\u000a  It says volume by, use the formula to find the volume...\u000a  Okay, so. I got 53 when I added up the numbers.\u000a  Yeah, I did, too.\u000a  I took it and divided by three.\u000a  17.6666.\u000a  Just do 17.6.\u000a  No, 17 point three sixes. So, we'll just...\u000a  Just, no, Hayden, we have to find 17.666 'cause all six of them, put 17.6.\u000a  I know, but, we are now, let's just round it up one to 18.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  So, with average, it's 18. Okay.\u000a  So, now, we have to do, based on our average, how close were you to your guess, so, how close were we to our guesses, so, like...\u000a  I was close by seven.\u000a  I was close by nine.\u000a  We have 18 here, how far was nine and 18?\u000a  I don't know. Nine.\u000a  Nine plus nine is 18, right?\u000a  Oh, yeah.\u000a  So, write nine right here. I was by five. Okay. All right, based on our average, how many drops would it take to make one liter?\u000a  18,000.\u000a  What? Oh, yeah.\u000a  You got us correct a few times.\u000a  Multiply it by...\u000a  If we had it to drops times 1000, 'cause that's how many milliliters are in a liter, we get 10,000.\u000a  Okay, so now, we do water disposal. Follow the directions to find the volume of three marbles using water fluid. So, first, we have to add milliliters of water to 100 milliliter... So, we have to add 20 milliliters of water into this. So, Giselle, you wanna do that?\u000a  No.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  That, yeah.\u000a  Pour it so this gets to 20, okay?\u000a  I'll pour it then. \u000a  Oops, whoa, okay.\u000a  Try not to put too much.\u000a  I'll pour it out.\u000a  Let's try again, it, with a dropper.\u000a  No, you're supposed to do it with a beaker.\u000a  I know, but if we're really, really close, and we can't do it with a beaker, then we're gonna have to do it with a dropper.\u000a  So, we just do this.\u000a  Okay, we're at 20. I think that's 20.\u000a  We're at 19\u000a  I got it.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Just... Don't drop it too fast 'cause... I, okay. Okay. So, now we have to add the three marbles, so...\u000a  We'll bring 'em on this side.\u000a  Yeah, you have one, Hayden has one, and I have one.\u000a  No, let Alina have one. You do...\u000a  Alina poured the water. So, it's you, Amy, and Hayden.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Okay, so, we have to like, tilt it to roll down the cylinder.\u000a  I think I can do it.\u000a  Yeah, I know, but it's the easiest way.\u000a  No, not that much, you don't wanna, don't wanna pour some out. Sayonara, sucker.\u000a  Okay, the water level now is 26 exactly. All right, so it went from 20 to 26. So, the difference in volume is six, and the volume of the three marbles is six, right? What do you think, Alina?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  How do you think I got six?\u000a  I don't know.\u000a  Well, subtracted 20 from 26. Because it's 20 before the marbles and 26 after, so the marbles must be...\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Kay?\u000a  How we doin' over here?\u000a  Pretty good.\u000a  All right, I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions about volume. What have you learned about volume so far? Whenever you... Alina, look at the board that I made for you, okay? Whenever you drop drops of water into the graduated cylinder, what's happening to the volume?\u000a  What happened?\u000a  What happened to the volume of the water?\u000a  It was at 20 and then 26.\u000a  It got higher?\u000a  It went higher.\u000a  It went higher, okay, so we can say, then, that volume does what?\u000a  What did it do?\u000a  Rise.\u000a  It rose, okay. Volume rises, okay, so, the volume rose, good, and what did you find for the volume of the three marbles using water displacement? Did you get that far yet?\u000a  Yep.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  We got six because the water was at 20 before, and then after we put the marbles in, it was at 26, so, it's six 'cause you have to subtract the 26 minus 20.\u000a  Good, okay. If you can switch places with me, I wanna be able to hear Alina. Okay. All right, so, I'm gonna ask you another question. When you were doing-- if you got six, if the volume of those three marbles is six milliliters according to what you have, we need to change that to a solid measurement, okay? This is the solid measurement, cubes, that we use to measure solids. Marbles are solids. So, Alina, can you, can anyone tell me how we transfer that six milliliters to cubes? To centimeter cubes?\u000a  Each one of those is a gram, and if...\u000a  Each one of these is a gram, that's correct.\u000a  And if one milliliter is equal to one centimeter cubed, and all, and in that case, it must also be equal to one gram, so that's why for this, I wrote that the difference in volume was six grams and the volume of three marbles is six grams. I could also figure out that these are our three marbles, and we have six grams, then each one of them is 15 grams.\u000a  Okay, but grams, is that a unit of volume, or is that a unit of mass?\u000a  Mass.\u000a  Mass.\u000a  Good, Alina, it's a unit of mass. So, what Hayden said is correct. One centimeter, one milliliter is equal to one gram, one milliliter of water is equal to one gram, but what do we know about the cubic centimeters? We need to put the units in this term. So, if you got six milliliters for the volume of the three marbles, then how can we change it to centimeters cubed? How many milliliters is this, is one centimeter cubed? Do you remember, one. It's a one to one ratio, like Eli told us in home room. So, six milliliters must also be equal to six centimeters cubed. So, and this is the unit of volume, but you're also right, the mass must be, it will also be equal to one gram, but we're talking about volume, not mass.\u000a  So, it's the weight, it's the volume.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  It has to do with three times three times four.\u000a  But you have to explain why.\u000a  Because...\u000a  So, how do we know this?\u000a  \u000a  But why do we do that?\u000a  You don't know the answer right now.\u000a  Because it said that... \u000a  Three cubic centimeters. And a height of three cubic centimeters...\u000a  I don't know if that's really a three with a height of four.\u000a  Yeah, with a height of four. So, we have to do our work.\u000a  'Cause we built the work right there. And like...  \u000a  Height from a... \u000a  And the height. Hold on. So... So, Summer, three times three, and then...\u000a  Yeah, times four.\u000a  I'm up to three times three. That's nine, and then times four gives you three times...\u000a  When I did this, it was four times three, I know that. \u000a  Is...\u000a  So, three times...\u000a  16.\u000a  No.\u000a  Three times three is nine, times four is...\u000a  Okay, it's three times four-- Okay, it's nine times four. Why would that be 60?\u000a  36.\u000a  Yeah, so, we did three times three, we calculated nine times three.\u000a  So, that gives you nine,  and then because there's a height of three, you multiply by four, which gives you 36 because it's a basic math problem.\u000a  And it gives you 36.  Okay. So, explain why you know that. And then...\u000a  And then we go on to number two.\u000a  But wait for her to finish.\u000a  I am. I'm just gonna be a little... Change the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume. Try and it and explain. Of course not, because we're gonna feel like I think is something's wrong.\u000a  Well, we can...\u000a  Well, I guess if...\u000a  No we can't 'cause you can take that one off the building height.\u000a  No, we could tip this  over this way. and solve for--\u000a  Why would you do that?\u000a  What? We're done with problem one. \u000a  So, now...\u000a  So, I guess we could. Yeah. But, no, but in, we'd still have, we would still have the same volume.\u000a  All right, so the next problem is can you change...\u000a  Summer, are you still--\u000a  I'm fine.\u000a  I know, but we already read it though.\u000a  She can read, she needs to read it, Ryan.\u000a  So, what, say we couldn't because the numbers, we'll have to do the, oh wait, no.\u000a  No, we could...\u000a  No, because like, we won't...\u000a  We're doing the height and we turn it sideways. \u000a  Yes, we would. It's true.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  So...\u000a  So... How are you guys doing?\u000a  For number two, we wanted to, we had it like this, and we wanted to turn it sideways 'cause that would change the height around...\u000a  Okay, so let's talk about number two, that's the one you're on?\u000a  I'm completely knocked it over.\u000a  All right, so, the question is, on number two, can you change the length, width? Can you change the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume? Try it and explain. Okay, so, first of all, the first rectangular prism, you built, so this rectangular prism, okay, was one centimeter, I mean, three centimeters long.\u000a  We did three times three, it was nine because it had a line...  So, three times three is nine, then times four, times height of four, I don't know.\u000a  Okay, so this is the rectangular prism you built for number one, correct? Okay, and then you just multiply its length times its width, times its height, and what did you get, Summer?\u000a  I got 36.\u000a  36.\u000a  And I'm thinking that more than one thing can equal 36, like if we had...\u000a  Okay, so, how many cubes did you use to get this?\u000a  Two for 36.\u000a  This 36? How many cubes were there in all?\u000a  In all, that was 36.\u000a  It was 36, you had to count out the cubes, right? So, can you use the same\u000a  But have like, a different height.\u000a  But have a different length, width, and height?\u000a  Well yeah, the answer would be yes because more, there are multiple pieces, you could do six like, well, you do two, three, and six.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Two times three equals six, six times six equals 36.\u000a  Two times three times six would equal 36.\u000a  Right, as long as the three would be height.  So, six could be this.\u000a  Okay. Summer, what do you think? They think you can change these numbers and it still be 36 cubes. Could you still use 36 cubes, build a rectangular prism, and, but get different numbers here? You can, why do you think so?\u000a  Because it has to change it from, then, like, the 36 would still be the same.\u000a

V Yeah. Why don't we list that up here?  Okay. Here is what you're going to do. Go ahead and put your pencils back inside that basket for me really quick. Put those pencils away in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one and just to make sure you haven't . Now, you have identified, you have taken this work of art, you've seen what it is and you've taken out all those elements of art and you listed them and you told me how they were being used. Now, we need to figure out what is that artist trying to tell you with those elements. What kind of thought, feeling is this artist communicating to you with these elements, with this subject? So, who can raise their hand and tell us first what is one element that you found? What's one?\u000a Shapes.\u000a Shapes. What's another one?\u000a Color.\u000a Color.\u000a Shape lines.\u000a Value.\u000a Value. Texture. You guys, with those elements, they're telling you something. So, here's what we're going to. We're going to put on our thinking, pairing, and sharing hats. So, whatever I do that  so you guys can pair and share together, will you take your material with you so that you can use them for reference? Thank you. All right. First question--ready? The first question is how does this man feel? Now, think for 30 seconds by yourself how does this man feel? No talking. Think to yourself. Think. Shh... You've got to tell me why, too. Don't just think about feeling. Tell me why. Two people look like they're pairing already. Don't pair yet. Now, tell your neighbors what you think this man is thinking, is feeling is feeling.  All right. Now we're ready to share with the whole group. So, I'm going to start with, right here with Jermaine's group and we're going to go around and each person is going to get a turn, or each pair is going to get a turn. So, first, what was your group thinking? How did he feel?\u000a Sad.\u000a Why?\u000a Because the color blue is a sad color. And he looked down .\u000a So he had two reasons-- he had the body position, because he's kind of looking down like this and he also he had a connection with what you learned in kindergarten, good job, he said that sad and the color blue go together. What do you guys think? How does he feel?\u000a I think he feels happy. He's smiling and he's playing the guitar.\u000a Okay, because he's creating music. Maybe that's what makes him happy. I heard Miss Webster had a disagreement when they were pairing. Miss Webster, what is your take? What do you think he's feeling? Tell me what you think he is? Sit up, tell me what you think he is.\u000a I think he's sad because...\u000a Okay. Because why? \u000a He looks what? Say it again, honey. Don't be embarrassed. It's okay to have a different opinion.\u000a I think he is lonely because he doesn't have any friends.\u000a There's nobody else in that picture. He is by himself in the picture. Maybe he's lonely. We don't know. Okay. So, we had a difference of opinion. That's okay. Next pair.\u000a I think he's sad because he's looking down. If he was happy he'd be .\u000a Whoa. Wait a minute. She just said this man doesn't have anything to eat. Why do you think he doesn't have any?\u000a Because his shirt is torn, he don't have no pants and he don't have no socks.\u000a So, you're telling me he looks what? Is he rich or is he poor?\u000a No. He's poor.\u000a Okay. That is very good insight on not only the details, but also just what those details are telling us, okay? Do you have something else to add? What would you say?\u000a I said I think he was happy to sit alone. I think he's happy because he just \u000a Okay. So, you think the guitar looks-- even though his clothing looks torn, his guitar looks nice, right? Maybe he just puts a lot of value on keeping it nice. Maybe he puts a lot of value on keeping his guitar nice rather than his clothes. Maybe not. Last pair, tell me what you think he's feeling.\u000a I think he's--\u000a One at a time.\u000a I think he's . ...It looks like he's playing a sad song. He's playing a sad song and he's playing--\u000a Why do you think it looks like he's playing a sad song?\u000a Because he's bowing his head down and his face don't look very happy.\u000a Okay. You guys, next question-- I can see everyone sitting nice and tall in your seat. Did you have something different than that? Okay. Go ahead.\u000a I think he's sad because he looks like he's homeless.\u000a Oh, maybe he's homeless. Now, why do you think he's homeless?\u000a Because his shirt's torn on the side.\u000a Are there any other clues besides his clothing? We already had Miss Marshall tell us about his clothing. What other clues do we have that makes us think he's homeless?\u000a \u000a ...without talking and making noise. Jermaine, do you have a clue why he might be homeless? Why?\u000a Because he's outside by his self.\u000a He looks like me might be outside. This might be a step that he's sitting on. Next question... Next question--what do you think the artist is trying to tell us? What is the important message-- put your hands down. Think. What is the message? Why is the artist painting this picture of this man? I have one person, she's got herself in the thinking posture. She's thinking. Think please. Think, think, think. I've got a good thinker at this table. I hope you're thinking, honey. Okay. Now, pair up. Ready? Pair and share with your table mate. Get paired up.  Thirty more seconds to share. I hear some good talking so I'm giving you 30 more seconds. Why don't you share this time because you shared last time? Okay. So, you're going to share this time. Let's see you sitting up nice and tall. We're going to share with the entire group. We all learn from each other. You guys, we're going to start with the opposite way. I'm going to go this way. Can you tell me what the artist is trying to tell us, by painting this picture-- I'm sorry, just a second. Could you wait until your classmates are showing you the respect you deserve? You guys, when you're listening to what he's saying, he's trying to tell you what he thinks, what his table mate thinks. So, you need to turn your body, make eye contact and really listen to what he's saying, okay? Okay. Go again.\u000a I think the artist did this picture because he wanted kids to know how alone he is and how he's homeless. He doesn't have any money. He doesn't have any value.\u000a Okay. When you mean value, do you mean value like art value or what kind of value do you mean?\u000a Like he seems very sad.\u000a Okay. So, you're talking about the color, right? Okay. Next group.\u000a I think that the artist is trying to persuade him--\u000a Wait a minute. Say that word again. He's trying to what?\u000a Persuade.\u000a Persuade us what? Persuade us to think what?\u000a Persuade us  He feels real mad or trying to do music or something.\u000a Okay. Is that what your team came up with? You came up with something different than your team. You had a disagreement, right?\u000a I think that I was not .\u000a Do you think the artist wants you to be like him?\u000a No.\u000a What do you think the artist wants you to learn from him?\u000a He won't have nothing to work... .\u000a You can have a better life, right? Okay. This group-- could you put your feet down? It's your turn. You're going to share with us what your team came up with? You can share. Come on. You can talk to us. Remember that there's no wrong answer. It's just what you think.\u000a

V  Present your position to the other side. Make sure that you include the SFI that backs up your position. Okay? After that three minutes, we'll swap sides. All right. So, three minutes, pros go right ahead. \u000a We're talking about how minorities have made a lot of progress since Reconstruction, and political things. Originally, there was  no black senators or congressman, but after  Reconstruction, around 1865, there was two black senators and fourteen congressmen, and now there's four black senators and I'm sure more black congressmen. \u000a It's like quadruple the representatives. \u000a And other minorities are representative-- represented in the House and Senate, so they've made a lot of  progress becoming a representative government.  \u000a They didn't have the knowledge of earlier.  So that's one way Reconstruction positively affected  education in the South... in America...  Also these statistics show that even though...  even though certain states are slightly low on the circulation per capita statistics Virginia is number fifteen, which is relatively high for   a Southern state.  Except Florida is number thirty-four. And not all Northern states were held higher than--   education held higher than Southern states.  Like Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware,  which are all Northern states,   are in relatively low positions on the scale.  \u000a And former slaves were able to kind of give back  more to the culture, and they influenced technology, and science, and advances in those. And kind of started influencing culture in the South and  kind of in all the United States.   So... and it really basically spread freedom through the South and finally gave the former  former slaves a voice and a place in the country.  And finally brought them together.   Y'all have anything else? \u000a : I found...\u000a : The ones... they could like progress forward and they could ...   because they have so many African-American positions and authors for that... for that.  I think, overall, it finally gave blacks a place and gave the South a place in the country again,  where they had been separated for so long.  Kind of started bringing everybody together again. \u000a Because after the Civil War, the South still thought that 'We don't have to cooperate with the North...'  \u000a All right, guys. That was pro. All right. Three minutes, let's here the anti. Three minutes and then we'll after... Listen real quick, guys. After this three minutes, we'll give it another minute, okay, and one more minute after that for a rebuttal, okay. For the final statement of the pros, okay? Go ahead, antis.\u000a 1865  time of Reconstruction and during... nothing really got done.  If you look at the statistics, the infant mortality in Mississippi is number one and if you go on to the  lifestyle statistics, Mississippi is the very... has the least number of museums, concert halls, and observatories in city centers, showing the link between Reconstruction and just how it affected the South and how nothing got done  after the Civil War. \u000a : Let me, I'm sorry to interrupt,  let me ask you this... What caused... I mean, there had to have been something I mean... during Reconstruction, everything was progressing. Something happened to cause that overwhelming   shift in numbers that you just pointed out   That, you know, the Southern states - the old  Confederate states - dominated the bottom of that poll.  Why do you think that is? Why would that happen?\u000a Because the North is trying to punish the South. after the Civil War.\u000a They're more focused on helping themselves  and not helping the South\u000a Because they're more focused on slavery than  actually trying the help the South because they were trying to punish them. So they didn't... They were trying the free the slaves they weren't trying to help the South because they didn't want them to become stronger, also.\u000a : Was there a particular event that really  solidified this, that really made that come to fruition?  What is it the time frame of your question?\u000a 1865 to 1877\u000a Okay, so...\u000a During Reconstruction.\u000a Right. So what happened at the end of Reconstruction?  Why 1877?    What happened in 1877? \u000a They took the military out of the South. \u000a Exactly  So, if the military was pulled out, what do you  think caused this result?  \u000a ...economic constraints imposed by Northern owners  and eventual overseas competition hampered development and Birmingham never developed into the world-class steel-making center that it was supposed to be. So yeah, it did sort of improve, but it just  never reached its potential because, and it even says hampered by Northern constraints. So the North basically said you can't produce more steel because we say so. So you can't... so Birmingham just couldn't really get any better at that point.  \u000a So the South has more industry now, like everything in the South is  in the lower twenty-eight percent.\u000a Okay, guys, listen. We're going to give you one more minute. You have a one minute period, the pros, if you want to add a little rebuttal to what you just heard, okay. After this minute we're going to take two minutes to compile our final position, okay, like our final little thesis, all right, that we're going to present then to the class. Okay. So one minute for a rebuttal from the pros. Go ahead. \u000a Because, since the military left, everybody revolted, so...\u000a They had no motivation.\u000a Everything that had been implemented for those years went out the window and... \u000a But I think it's still, a positive way, was that it at  least it still left kind of some ideas of how to keep order  and the South still kind of had gotten a taste from the  military on how the Americans wanted things run and how  they needed to do to function as America and... so I think that mostly the military Reconstruction  like that was good, because it kind of came in and  helped them that way.  \u000a : What is the number of African-American senators and representatives? What does it show? What is the difference between  Reconstructive-Era... ... huge difference.\u000a All right, guys, listen up. You get two minutes. I need each side to compile your final argument, okay, your final statement. This is what you're going to present to the rest of the class. Remember you need SFI to back up your position, okay. That SFI can be census data. More importantly, it can be book data. Okay. Just normal, normal information from your text. So two minutes, go ahead and write it out if you want. Go.  Each side comes up with their final points. \u000a We could go into more detail on the three-fifths compromise and we could mention the Ku Klux Klan intimidated... even though they got the vote, they were still controlled by the white people.\u000a Yeah, the social system still was there.  OK, I'll write that down. \u000a Could this be applied too?\u000a : Absolutely Remember, you have to explain to the class in  a way that they can understand it, okay?  They don't have that particular census data in front of them. So make sure that you're clear  when you present that as SFI in front of the class. \u000a Tell them how many libraries and \u000a Virginia is the only one that's in the top fifty percent.\u000a Completed out of fifty, and so...  All the Southern states are in the bottom...  And then, this is trying to say, what? Twenty-five right here?  Oh, so the bottom twenty-five, half...  Existing at the time, which was...  Should we tell them that these states aren't...  or should we just not tell them? \u000a No, I would just...  \u000a Most African-Americans that were unskilled at the time,  worked through this program to become more independent workers  and to learn to read and write, and so... I'll go back to my statistics here, Virginia and Florida  All right, guys, we're going to go in this order. Listen up. We're going to go in this order. We're going to go economic, then social, political, then educational. Okay. The pros are going to give their positions first to the class. All right? Now, the chart that you have in front of you, what I want you guys to do is while the rest of the groups are presenting their findings, their positions, I want you to take down three different pieces of information that you hear, specific pieces of information that you guys hear from the presenter. All right. Because you're going to use this when you formulate your own response at the end of class to how you feel about, you know, the efficacy of Reconstruction, based on what you've heard. Okay. You're going to make your decision, so you need to make sure that you have information down to support that, okay, to support your idea. And make sure you're getting that from their presentations. All right? So we're going to go with economic first. Economic pro, you have two minutes. Camille, you it?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a All right. Everybody listen to Camille.\u000a Okay. So we came up with a thesis and it was, "Reconstruction positively affected America economically by bringing a broader selection of products to the South and North. And the North was trying to find ways to help the South with the 13th and Alabama, and Mississippi, and everyone, they started mining for coal, and iron, and everything, and so that helped their economies because they were able to make more money with that instead of just cotton. And the North put a few restrictions on that, but that still helped their economy for more products. And the North manufactured more, like, grain. And we talked about other things that weren't really economic. That was about it, that we could come up with.\u000a Okay. Thank you. All right. Anti? Who is our speaker today? Okay, Grant, go ahead.\u000a  All right. So you mentioned the steel, and iron, and coal industries, and yes, those did help. But at the same time, the North industries, the North's economy was growing, and it was growing faster than the South. And there was the whole economic deals with inflation, where... So the South basically was making more, like a higher number of dollars, but it essentially was the same work as before the war.\u000a

V  Anything else?\u000a  So,  what composter would you want?\u000a  I think we would want maybe like a three-tray or four-tray vermicomposter. And I do now admit it would be helpful to get one that would be cheaper. Maybe you guys have a different idea?\u000a  Maybe, I was thinking that maybe we can make one, because I printed off some directions how to make a vermicomposter. So again, that would save us a lot of money just to make it. Like, this might cost $20 to get all these supplies. And I know some people have supplies at their houses that they could bring in to use for this. And this might cost $20, when a store-bought one off the internet may cost $100.\u000a  Yes, but the  store-bought one's are quality, and a professional makes it. So they know what they're doing.\u000a  I doesn't really  matter, I mean it has the same purpose, it does the same thing. I just matters on the worms.\u000a  The only thing that  we really have to buy is the worms.\u000a  Dylan and Ben, I got to admit, I do agree with Claire. Buying one would be a good quality and what do we know about, I know it says. . . what do we know, about...\u000a  Now, where are you guys in your conversation?\u000a  We're deciding  to do wood, metal, or plastic. But he said that the wood would rot and the metal could rust.\u000a  It could rust  because of the moistness of the compost.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  It's not metal.\u000a  We're not talking about metal.\u000a  So we might do plastic.\u000a  On what?\u000a  If we make it.\u000a  Purchasing one?\u000a  No, if we make our own. \u000a  But this one is award-winning. \u000a  Seventy dollars.\u000a  All right, and did you know what website you found that so you could share it as a class? \u000a  This is buying a vermicomposter that would cost $70. And what did you say about yours?\u000a  This is about like $20, because we need two of these eight to 10 gallon plastic storage boxes. And we need two of them, and it says the cost is about five dollars each. And that would save us a lot so we could get Weebly pro, tools, and then maybe later on we could by the reusable bags.\u000a  So what are your thoughts on helping the whole community?\u000a  I think we should build this because it's better and we would have more money left over.\u000a  And how would you spend the other money left over?\u000a  I would spend it on like, stuff that we need for composting, like for tools.\u000a  Okay, wait, we have multiple conversations going here in this group. So let's wait.\u000a  I would spend  it on the tools, Weebly Pro, and if we have some money left over we could probably get more from the compost. And then we could get that tea thing that gets the tea out. And that way you could get more money. And then we could get something else.\u000a  What's Weebly Pro?\u000a  It's like an extra, you can search it up on Google.\u000a  Isn't it a website?\u000a  It's 26 compost, and then you can have a many slides as you want, videos. And then we can sell our compost on the internet, and that would help a lot.\u000a  So, how is the Weebly Pro better than the Weebly that we already have? Because you were the webmaster on the class website, on the composting website. And you want to, what do you want us to do?\u000a  We can have,  buy the six-month plan, and then the guys for next year, they figure it out.\u000a  And how would us buying the Weebly Pro help the community?\u000a  It would help us  to sell it and to inform about compost.\u000a  Okay, any other comments or thought?\u000a  We could,  it could maybe inform the people more because we could make a video of how to compost so they could make their own.\u000a  Okay, inform who? Be more specific.\u000a  The viewers of the website.\u000a  All of our guests?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a  There's a  greater chance it's not gonna fail.\u000a  Guys, we're not playing the what-if game.\u000a  I not saying,  but we have a chance that the cups might break, because they're cups and they have an easier chance,\u000a  It has a  bigger chance of not failing.\u000a  We have to take risks. We have to.\u000a  Plus, you would have the pride of making your own. \u000a  If we make our own,  and we mess up, then we're just wasting money.\u000a  What if, what if, what if, what it.\u000a  I'm not doing the what-if!\u000a  ' Cause remember last time when we built a-- \u000a  If you make it,  there is a greater chance you will fail.\u000a  Maybe instead  of cups, we use PVC pipes. I mean, they're that cheap, and I mean they would hold longer than styrofoam cups. \u000a  Shhh, too many people.\u000a  That's better quality.\u000a  I do agree with you, Adam, but I also do agree with Dylan and Ben on two different subjects.\u000a  Guys, why don't  we just make everything? We can make the compost bin,\u000a  But if we make everything,\u000a  reusable bags. \u000a  Why don't we buy  the vermicomposter, and then we make the bags?\u000a  The reusable  bags are more like, for people to buy if they want to have an easy reusable bag. And then the tools, we might really need later on when we don't need the reusable bags. We might need the tools, or we said, we might need to go buy this now, and it might be too late already.\u000a  What's the major difference between the vermicomposter and the reusable bags? Jessica, what's the major difference between the two?\u000a  In vermicomposting, it keeps reproducing, there's three products. While the reusable bags, when you sell them once, and that's all you get from that bag.\u000a  And with the  vermicomposter, it keeps going. It's very unlikely, almost impossible, that all the worms are going to die in one night.\u000a  Plus,why would  you buy the bags if you can make them? 'Cause my mom has a friend that makes her own bags out of store bags, like Walmart and Target bags. And she melts them down and puts them into a bag.\u000a  Why don't we  buy the vermicomposter so it's a better quality, and we make the bags? They're easier.\u000a  It's very hard  to find a perfect vermicomposter that's plastic and won't break. Most of them are terracotta and they'll shatter if somebody knocks it over. It's also wood, and wood will start to absorb the smells of the compost and then it will start to smell bad.\u000a  How do you know  we're going to do wood?\u000a  Compost things on  the internet are using either terracotta or wood. Terracotta shatters really easily. \u000a  Okay, so we need to do more research on this.\u000a  I found a four-tray  bin that's plastic for $89.99.\u000a  But still, why  would we pay $100, when we can pay. . .\u000a  For quality.\u000a  ...a mere $20. \u000a  I know,  but the materials we use aren't made for composting.\u000a  Listen to Carly for a second. What Carly?\u000a  Because if  we do what Ben's mom's friend can do, you could easily save more money like you do if you make the vermicomposter.\u000a  Do you think you could get your mom's friend to come in and teach us as a class on how to make our own like she already does? \u000a  I think we should buy the vermicomposter first, like buy it or make it, and then buy the reusable bags. So, just like Ben's mom's friend's bags.\u000a  But we should make them both, because then we will still have some money left over to buy other things like tools.\u000a  Like a new aerator.\u000a  If we make the reusable bags we won't get to put our symbol on it, which I think is part of the bag.\u000a  We're thinking  about doing ovens.\u000a  'Cause it's like one, two, three, four, five, six.\u000a  If we made it, we wouldn't have a guarantee that it would work, because we could screw up the way we make it. Or we could just mess it up in general. But if we bought one, it would be kind of guaranteed to work.\u000a  But sometimes  we miss a part, or a tool that we need to put it together.\u000a  How do you know that sometimes, what experience do you have that sometimes all the parts aren't always there?\u000a  Because  when we were making the other one and forgot one of the tools, so we couldn't do one part of it. And then it just all got all messed up.\u000a  It just threw us off.\u000a  So from your experience you know that sometimes when we order something, we don't always get it.\u000a  This part is the leading thing right there, it comes built. All we have to do it put the plastic bars together, and it will be kind of easy. 'Cause it just like, goes. Yeah, and you can work as a group to make it. Because it's like those styrofoams where you pull it together. And you can just see where it's put together, the sticks.\u000a  Like the couplers on the sides.\u000a  So, we have  something to be proud of that we made.\u000a  Everybody said  that we wanted a see-through one so we could actually see the dirt.\u000a  And this one's not see-through. So, if we made our own, could we get a clear tote? \u000a  ...'cause the worms  don't like light. So you can lift to look. And the worms don't like light, so when you look at it, lift it up, look at it and then put it back down.\u000a  That's a good idea. No one else has thought about that, Christian. And how do you know that the worms don't like light?\u000a  Because we looked it up on the internet.\u000a  And then one time  I was in my house, and I saw a worm out in the street, and it was kind of like rattling, rattling in the sun. So then my sister kicked it in, back in the grass. So then it was much happier and I re-research that.\u000a  Okay, but  do we have to do vermicompost?\u000a  No, we don't have to do it at all. It's going to be our class. We need to vote on what's going to be the best for the community.\u000a  What about reusable bags?\u000a  I think the  reusable bags are .\u000a  And why? How is the reusable bags different than what we're already doing?\u000a  If we sell the,  if the people next year sell them at the Holiday Boutique, then if we sell compost, then it would be the same customers. And if we give the customer something different more people will come because, they'll yeah, and they need bags.\u000a  They could buy bags to put their stuff in that they buy?\u000a  And for backpacks and stuff for when they go grocery shopping they need something to put them in instead of just wasting all those plastic bag. They could use the reusable bag.\u000a  I have an idea, I think we should stick with our old compost in our tumbler, And then we should get the bags. And we should have the compost and the bags of compost tea. And then they could buy the bags, and they could buy the compost, and they could have the compost tea in the bag and they could carry it so it's not that hard.\u000a  So we could use our bags as the packaging for the compost?\u000a  Yeah, that's  what I was thinking.\u000a  It's gonna cost extra.\u000a  And then  make it just a bit more expensive 'cause then you get to keep the reusable bag and the compost.\u000a  You know, if you put your money in the bank they give you money? This would basically give you money, because you can make the compost, yeah the interest, yeah. So we can get the money from this, and then we can buy the bags for the high-level tea.\u000a  But that has no  holes for the worms. The sun is coming right into--  But would it fit in our room?\u000a  So, we need to get more information on this.\u000a  Remember we were talking about the internet could be wrong about its size?\u000a  Yeah, but normally they don't do false advertisement,\u000a  This is like in a this-- --the bottom is like this size of a desk.\u000a  You could compare this to this vase or this container that they would put the plant in.\u000a  It's like a shower, it's like the size of a shower.\u000a  Yeah, you guys need more information.\u000a  We need more information before you can make a decision on that?\u000a  A lot of information on this already.\u000a  But we won't  make tea if this one would have really worked, cause it's made. You know, the more it costs the better it works.\u000a  Do you agree with his comment?\u000a  No.\u000a  Yeah, that's what Cara said. \u000a  Can anyone give an example?\u000a  I don't agree  with that, because when I was real little I bought some toy cars and they didn't work as well as I got--some that were cheaper. And the cheaper ones worked better than the expensive ones.\u000a  Okay, you guys continue discussing that.\u000a

V They're coming around. They're coming around. When you have it, "You're a Grand Old Flag" goes under your seats. "What Do the Stars Do?" Put them in your hands. William, why don't you come sit next to Victoria? Do you mind? Because then you're a little closer. Just move a little closer to Jeffrey. Stand. Reach. Stand up. Stand up. Big breath. Oh my goodness. Relax. Put your hands here. Get a diaphragm breath instead of that kind of a breath. Here we go, big diaphragm breath. Ready? Breathe in. Remember the beginning of the year when you were doing  Ready? Breathe in. Here we go. Let it all out. Breathe in, diaphragm breath. Put your hand here. Breathe. Again.  Hiss it all out  Breath in. And you're going to go  Ahhhhhhh ready? Here we go. Breathe in. Start up. Breathe in. Good low diaphragm. Relax your shoulders and ahhhhhhh. Breathe in. Do you see what you're gonna do? Instead of hissing out, you're gonna go ahhhhhh and let it nice and open and tall. Ready? Breathe in. Ahhhhhhh. Big low breath. Ready? Ready? Here we go. \u266a  \u266a Okay. That's far too sweet. We need it to get ugly. Let it get ugly, and I want a slide. I need to hear every single pitch. Ready? Really try and let that sound vibrate in your forehead. Sing it like... I want you to zero that sound right at me, like you really mean it. I know you do. Ready? \u266a  \u266a Much better. Again. \u266a  \u266a Get a big breath. Again, I want to hear every pitch on the . One, two, ready, go. \u266a  \u266a I love it. Do it here. \u266a  \u266a Whoo. Sit down. Take out "What Do the Stars Do?" Please my friends, look at part one. Big breath. This is tricky because we start on a low so. It's what do the stars , Very, very high. Make sure you're sitting up with good posture. \u266a  \u266a Here we go. \u266a  \u266a I am so impressed that you remember so much of that. That was beautiful. We're gonna do it again. We want a really round ooh, and I need a little more emotion on. \u266a  \u266a Do you feel it? Think about it. You're singing to the stars. How cool is that? Right? Here we go. Not like celebrities either, like the actual stars in the sky. Here we go. \u266a  \u266a Love what  I'm hearing. Is the word "do" interesting? Or do we just kind of seem to hold it forever and it's kind of boring? Speak really loudly. Christopher, what was your idea?\u000a We could crescendo.\u000a We could crescendo. I think that's a great idea. I think it needs some kind of motion. So let's put a little crescendo on the word "do." Ryan, what's your question? A sforzando? We'll try that in a second. Let's see. We'll choose which one we like better. Let's try just a crescendo on "do," just to keep it interesting. So it's \u266a  \u266a Try and do it in one breath. If you have to breathe. Don't breathe at the same time as your neighbor. Stagger. Ready? Here we go. \u266a  \u266a I love the crescendo. We have to get it together for up. Right? Let's try Ryan's idea. You want to do a sforzando on "do?" Okay. Let's try it. Ready? So it's \u266a  \u266a That was your idea too, Maria? Let's try that. Ready? Here we go. \u266a  \u266a You like that? You like it? Raise a hand for crescendo. Quiet. A quick quiet hand. Raise that quiet hand for crescendo. Raise a quiet hand for sforzando. Okay. Sforzando wins. That's what we're gonna do on the word "do. " Love it. It's really, really pretty. Make sure the word "do", You keep it really nice and open. Claire, are you sitting on a chair? Or are you sitting between Rose and Garrety. Just go grab a chair. You don't have to squish like that. Ready? Here we go. It's okay. I know she came in a little late. So that's why she's... You looked a little too close for comfort over there. \u266a  \u266a Yeah, very strong. Yes. Ready? Just Lauren, move in a little bit. \u266a  \u266a \u266a  \u266a  \u266a  \u266a What happens there? What happens there on that one? It goes one up higher. Thank you, Rachel. \u266a  \u266a Right? Can we start right before 11? Pick ups to 11. Ready? Here we go. \u266a  \u266a What comes next? Where are we? \u266a  \u266a That's how far we want to get today on that. Look at where the clouds, where the clouds can fly. Notice part three does \u266a  \u266a Is your pitch after the word higher, lower, or the same as the pitch in part three? Higher, lower, or the same as the pitch as "below?" Are you sure? We start on the same. So that's how you're gonna know to \u266a  \u266a Yeah. Is this gonna be beautiful? This is gonna be... Sorry. I think this is gonna be really beautiful, like which one we just did. Yeah. It has a lot of the same kind of qualities, but there's some really rich harmonies and some really rich, beautiful opportunities for crescendo and decrescendo and all that kind of stuff. Yes. The whole song isn't a cappella. It's a cappella in parts. Yeah. It starts out a cappella, which means no piano. Jeffrey, sit up. It's a cappella for a little while, and then the piano comes in. Then it's a cappella again, and then the piano comes in, and then it ends a cappella. So it kind of goes back and forth. What we want to get from this, for today, from this piece, is I want to hear your expression. I want to hear that crescendo, that decrescendo. Same thing on the word "clouds." What do we think? What should... It's another one of those long notes. So we need to do something with it. What should we do with it? Decrescendo? Put a crescendo in it? Energize it a little bit? Should we try each? Should we try a decrescendo and try a crescendo and see which one we like better? So the long "cloud" \u266a  \u266a Two of them. We have two of them. So let's energize them, and then we'll try backing off. Let's see. Ready? I believe that's our pitch. Ready? Here we go. One. Two. \u266a  \u266a Do we like that? Just energize it a little bit? That was crescendo. Do we want to try backing off? \u266a  \u266a Which one do we like better, you guys? Let's try the decrescendo. Ryan, question? Oh, one of each. That's what you're thinking, Rose? So make one crescendo, one decrescendo? So maybe which one? So first one grow, second one decrescendo. Yeah, kind of pulling back a little. Posture. First one is gonna grow. Ready? \u266a  \u266a I love it. I love it. Let's do from the beginning of that piece. All right? Think about your expression. Singing about stars. One, two, three, one. \u266a  \u266a Beginning. So it's \u266a  \u266a and our "do." What were we gonna do with it? I know it's hard when I'm by the piano. I won't be. Ready? Here we go. \u266a  \u266a \u266a  \u266a \u266a  \u266a Beautiful. Beautiful. I think that piece is gonna be gorgeous. I can't believe it's only your second day on it. Yeah. You know what? The clouds or the clouds can fly had a really beautiful crescendo, lovely expression. Put that one under your chair and take out "You're a Grand Old Flag".\u000a

V Negative x minus it? \u000a It's one over, oh wait, oh wait wait wait wait.\u000a  How do we solve for X?\u000a  X is the value of R anyway. X is the value of R.\u000a What would you do for the one over X? Wouldn't that be the first term?\u000a  X is the value of R .\u000a What I would suggest you do is, is that you could rewrite this as an expression.\u000a Oh, as the power ? Oh. Oh, okay okay.\u000a I used .\u000a  Oh, yeah yeah. All right, yeah I got it. So it's gonna be negative X minus one, okay. Okay, no I got it. So the first, it's gonna be, so what-- \u000a  Whatever. \u000a  Oh, come on.\u000a  I just wanted to find where it talks about--\u000a  It would be one minus one .\u000a  Oh we have one .\u000a  Is one over x the sum?\u000a  Do you see, see what I'm saying? Yeah.\u000a  I'm gonna put it in there, so negative X minus one, 'cause later it's gonna change\u000a  Wait, you don't really have to do it out since it's gonna change the  so it's higher. You'll have to, you gotta . Yeah. \u000a No no no no no, don't, don't don't don't. Don't even do that. Do you know why? Because it's part of a . Well-- \u000a  Yeah yeah yeah. 'Cause the whole thing is negative, and then that's the \u000a Remember the .  \u000a  He's a natural.  \u000a  But now here's the question. You guys kind of already answered this question.  Could you have found it?\u000a They give you, basically R is two X.\u000a Uh huh.\u000a And, since it converges, it has to be less than the absolute value of .\u000a You got it. Okay. \u000a  That makes sense. \u000a  Go back for a second.\u000a Yeah, you multiply both sides by a third. So it'd be one third times every single one of 'em. And the interval .\u000a  Um--\u000a  Oh. Maybe someone's . It means it's gonna get shifted, and then .\u000a  You were just scaling the . Because it's like, .\u000a I'd never, I never considered . Oh, okay.\u000a  Yeah. \u000a  It's not gonna change the domain of the--\u000a  Oh, no, no, I'm putting plus negative-- \u000a  The answer.\u000a  Yeah. So, the only thing I'm thinking is it might be easier for you to just . It might make sense somehow.\u000a Oh, how do you read ?\u000a Yeah, how do you--\u000a  No no no, no no no no no. It doesn't reduce the time it takes for it to--\u000a No man, right? \u000a Oh, okay yeah.\u000a  One third. Oh, I get it, I get it.\u000a  It only converges as you, . No matter what, well no matter what. \u000a  One over X. Three X, five X, two in, two over X.\u000a  I think it does. \u000a  Thank you.\u000a  You're welcome.\u000a  That's what I'm, yeah, that's what I'm saying.\u000a  One over X. Because what they want you to do now,  So, you'd say power series is gonna be written as a form of, say, geometric series. Because now you've got, what? What's the first term? \u000a  Yeah? Right. Okay, what's the ratio?\u000a Negative .\u000a And when you write that out, put  around it.  Let him once, show him.\u000a Okay.  \u000a  Is it saying three X? \u000a I would be, I would take the .\u000a  Are you sure you're working together?\u000a Yes. \u000a  And I'll turn it, one. We got one, minus X squared.\u000a One over one plus X squared.\u000a That's X to the fourth, right? Minus X to the sixth, plus X to the eighth.\u000a This is, if you are indexing this. This is your first term, this is your second term, this is your third term, right? Think about the first one, okay? We have left that, in order to get that a two X. Like the first R, okay, the first side of it. And say, it's the second term that  the first time. So it's probably gonna, probably gonna be it. Probably.\u000a Okay.\u000a  At least on these simple ones.\u000a Okay.\u000a  Okay, leave that for .\u000a Okay.\u000a  N minus one over one minus one, x minus one would be zero, which would be .\u000a  Originally we have negative one .\u000a  X minus one. \u000a  The right one, so it's either gonna be .\u000a  Now you're expanding by three instead of zero six.\u000a  So, it's like negative X squared switched. So the negative that goes over here, is negative X squared, too. So the negative is which Y .\u000a  I don't, uh!  I don't know what I'm doing! \u000a  All right look, hold on. Isn't it the same as the third one?\u000a  That means that the Y, like the same one, Y is the common one.\u000a  Right? \u000a To the one, so this would be X minus one. And negative .  Just put in one here, four, all right? What's the ratio here?  \u000a  One, you're multiplying the outside of two X. Another one you're doing it as the two X. That means you're moving the X to the inside. If you take a function and you just scale it by a multiple, if you take arcsine of x, any function you want, and you multiply it by scale, like one third, one fourth, . \u000a  Ah, but then there we said--\u000a  No! Oh my God, what arc, what are you, wait wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.\u000a There's gonna be another one I haven't, there, and one third after that is what we're doing here. Our R remains the same. It's the whole series multiplied by the factor of one third.\u000a  Okay yeah, I'm agreeing to that.\u000a  I'm pretty sure that's right.\u000a You multiply this out, it's gonna be one over three, plus three x minus one.\u000a Why are you multiplying it out? Just think of it as a scale. It's not anything to do, it's not gonna affect our domain outside the function. It's only gonna affect the range. And therefore you're not gonna have any remains 'cause the remains only matter if you didn't have but like one third of it, so we're not doing it like that. One third after it, we're doing like a stretched version. So it's not gonna affect the equation. \u000a  , so it's negative X.\u000a  What? No no no no no no. \u000a  That's the series for .\u000a  Uh, all right.\u000a  I'm just  negative X squared. Right? \u000a  No, no, no, I'm putting negative x squared. It's easier, 'cause then later on when you do plus--\u000a  No, no, no, no, no, I-- .\u000a  The sine's been switching. No, no.\u000a  Yeah, but you can represent that by saying--\u000a  Yeah, it's gonna be smaller.  Well, it'll be switching, but like would you represent, how would you represent X in the whole thing?\u000a  To the negative, see the n minus one is put, that's how I'm doing it. \u000a  Wait, how would you find the ?\u000a  If it's the absolute value of x minus one, it would be less than one.\u000a  Mrs. Dockin?\u000a  Yes. \u000a  Is this, is this, is this X?\u000a We're not sure where we are because of these coefficients that change. \u000a What is X over R?\u000a Take this series right here, which is that. So, then integrate it. We just though you integrate every term to get it.\u000a Now you're looking for a general expression.\u000a Right.\u000a You have a general expression. It didn't tell you to come up with. no, they didn't tell you to do that.\u000a Oh, okay okay. Okay, because, in fact, that's not a power series.\u000a  That's not a power series?\u000a It is, okay, but it's a different form of a power series.  So you don't have to write 'em like this because you would also need to have, what? You also have to have .\u000a  Right, yeah okay.\u000a Got it? Okay. \u000a  You flip it around.\u000a One, good, yeah good, what's R? The negative of, yeah you're the negative x plus one, but it needs to be in parentheses. So now you need your R, okay? Now, you're gonna do them when you get to--\u000a  It needs to be a form of K over R.\u000a Oh, I thought we just solve for R? You said the third nominated was R. \u000a  All right guys, she said 1/3 times one, whatever that is. How do you multiply these?\u000a Does it need to be on the . \u000a Yeah, so you do it again.\u000a Yeah, multiply the whole interval, yeah. Multiply the interval.\u000a  And this is not in the form of a series. \u000a That one third, does that impact the greatness of one? That's the question you want to answer. I'm not answering it for you right now, you need to figure it out.\u000a  So, when it's asking for, does the function of the ? \u000a This, it's like that.\u000a  You didn't divide it by seven.\u000a

V Okay, I can see two  in here...\u000a Can you read the article first, please?\u000a Yes.\u000a Loudly.\u000a The president of the republic should be an Egyptian born to Egyptian parents and enjoy salient political rights. His age must not be less than 40 Gregorian years.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a I agree with the president, um...\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a He should be Egyptian born to Egyptian parents, because it will have, make him have well-rounded perspectives, and it may lead him to having interests to other countries, and so...\u000a It would make him have interest, or will not make him, prevent him?\u000a It would not prevent him to, um, from getting to a different country's interest than his country.\u000a Okay. Good job.\u000a I agree with Yessenia, because if both, if he's from parents that are Egyptians, he can have some connection with Egyptians, and he won't have pressure from other countries that want to change some of the rules they have. And, um, have, like, wars with different countries about their economy and things they have different.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a That's what I, that's what my opinion, yeah, that's why I agree with her.\u000a Good.\u000a I disagree with the part of the, where it says that they should be Egyptian parents.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a But I agree with Jesus and his concerns about the Egyptian parents. But my opinion is that they should have at least one parent Egyptian and the other another race.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a Because if one parent's Egyptian, like, the child, or the, becoming president, would have a something of concerns, and would know some parts of Egypt and its government, and if the other, and this other race would help him guarantee for the governments in the other places and countries, states.\u000a Okay. Good job.\u000a Which, the legislative process.\u000a Good job.\u000a I agree with Yessenia and Jesus, because if they're from Egypt and their parents are Egyptian, then they can have some cultural background, and they'll know more from people, and they'll have connections with the people.\u000a Good. Good. So now, what is the result now? Do you think you're going to change the part? I see, I've heard some different opinions here. Are you going with the change, or do you want to keep it as it is?\u000a I think we should keep it as it is, because, I mean, that's a good thing to have Egyptian parents and a background, like Hilda said, a background of culture.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a So I'll say yes, leave it. Just leave it the same.\u000a Okay.\u000a Just that part.\u000a Okay. Very good. So you will just leave that part as it is without change. Is there any other parts for this article?\u000a Yeah, there's a second part. His age must not be less than 40 Gregorian years.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a Um, I disagree, because, um, when you're young, you'll know more about technology and computers and everything.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a And that's how, um... the youth and younger children in Egypt, that's how they went and communicate.\u000a I agree with Yessenia a lot, because when a president is younger but not old, he can connect with the youth and other younger people. Because when Egypt was in the revolution, the president was 81 years old.\u000a Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\u000a Eighty-four. And behind the revolution was the young, and they were, like, younger. So he didn't really understand them really well, and they didn't understand him well, because he was a little older than them. So for me, I'll say 35, um... yeah, that's a good age for the president. They can connect with teenagers and people of younger...\u000a I just...\u000a Very good. I like the connection that you made, Jesus, between the age and the people who were behind the revolution. Good job.\u000a I disagree with Jessie and Jesus.\u000a Good. Yeah.\u000a Because I think that part of the constitution is okay, because 40, um, 40 years is, makes them have plenty of experience and  to doing his, their work. And, like, it makes them... like, for, like, what Jesus said about technology, they can learn about it, and they can show them and all. So basically, they, they'll pretty much know.\u000a Who do you mean by they?\u000a The becoming president.\u000a That the old, or the young?\u000a The old.\u000a The older one. He cannot understand or work with technology that much?\u000a Yeah. Because Jesus said that they, um, they won't know about technology much.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a But they, if they're 40, they would have plenty of experience.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a And they can learn about the technology and know how to communicate with the younger adults and teens, you know?\u000a Okay. Good, good.\u000a I agree with Emi, but I agree with Jesus and Yessenia, so...\u000a Mm-hm. That's okay.\u000a Um, because...\u000a Focus on what you want to do.\u000a Like, youth was, like, 70 or 80% of Egypt.\u000a Oh, good.\u000a But if he's older, he's going to have more responsibilities.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a And he can be more responsible.\u000a Mm-hm.\u000a So...\u000a I disagree with Hilda. Responsibility. Because when they're younger, they're more active and more responsible. Like, they can remember most things where they keep stuff. And when they're active, they can, like, travel through Egypt and see what's wrong with the country, and what's wrong with the economy, and they can make changes and talk to some people about their opinions and things they want to change the country. So I'll say the younger, but not too young. Like, 35 and up.\u000a Thank you.\u000a My opinion is that 40 is okay, because the young, the young people, like, at 35, because 35's not that young, but lower than that, can make a little bit of difficulties, because they make, they might make, like, a mistake. They might not know a thing, and they just put another thing.\u000a You mean they will not be mature enough?\u000a Yeah, mature.\u000a Sure. Good.\u000a Like, the 40s, the 40-year-old people, like, they, they pretty much know everything. They learn it, they were educated. The government laws, and...\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a ...this and that.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a But I think that part is, 40 years is better.\u000a Good. So you would like to say, okay, just to open or, or, or break it down to so young like 30 or 20, or even teenager, right? Well, I like that, the two parts that you brought, Hilda, about 70%, that the majority of the population of Egypt are already youth. And your part that you said that this will make, Jesus, that that will make, help them to have good connection with the young people there. Good job. So what did you decide on? I see that you're going with certain direction.\u000a We should change it. The first part of the statement of Art. 75.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a Which is the constitution. We should keep that as it is. And the second part of the 40 years, we should change it. Well, we should leave it like that, as well.\u000a Very good. I like how you are compromising with them, Emi, and you are going with the change. So what part are you going to change?\u000a Um...\u000a It will be transforming to what?\u000a Thirty-five.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a Thirty-five years.\u000a Not less than 35.\u000a Not less.\u000a Good job. Excellent. Very good. After you take your notes, let's move to the next article.\u000a Article 77. The term of the presidency shall be Gregorian, six Gregorian years, starting from the date of the announcement of the results of the .\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a The president of the republic may be re-elected for other successful years.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a I disagree with the six years. Um...\u000a Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes. Keep going.\u000a Because I think it's a little longer, and some advantages are that people could get tired of the same president, um, having them over again. And I think it should be lower, for four years, like in America. And some of the disadvantages are that people could like him, and he might be re-elected for another six more years. Um, people could elect him because he did some great things to the economy and things to the country. And that's what I think of for the first one. What do you all think about it?\u000a You think the first one should be as it is, or changed?\u000a Changed to four years.\u000a Changed to four years.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay.\u000a What do you think?\u000a I agree. I agree with Jesus, because an example of this is Hosni Mubarak. He, he, um, was following, supposedly, the terms of the constitution, which, which he made an excuse and took many chances in, um, having the presidency. So I, for, like, 30 years. So I, my opinion is to lower it down to four years, and if they're re-elected, which, they can use democracy like here in America.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a If they're re-elected, they will have at least 12 years. Basically.\u000a Okay.\u000a Do you disagree?\u000a Um, the statement, I agree, because it will give them more stability and more time to elect.\u000a Mm-hmm.\u000a I agree with Jesus and Emi.\u000a Why do you agree with them?\u000a Because six years is a lot of years, and if they don't like him, they'll have to wait a lot, a long time so that another president can come into power.\u000a Okay. So you think bringing it down to four years is better than having the president for one term for six years?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay.\u000a The second one is the president of the republic may be elected for another successful years. The thing I dislike about this is that they don't really explain how, um, the terms. For example, the president of Egypt, um, used an excuse to be re-elected, because, um, he said that in the constitution, it said, it didn't say specifically how much, how many terms, um, they lead. So I'll, I'll change that, that, um, leave specifically a number of terms they need to be elected. Um...\u000a Very good point, Luis. I didn't... um, Jesus, I'm sorry. Very good point here. You brought really a very important point. And this is what will, this was, like, the concern of many people over there. The specification of, of what?\u000a Successful terms.\u000a Of the, how many terms, very good. Successive terms. Very good.\u000a Does anybody have an opinion or disagreement?\u000a Uh, I...\u000a I agree with...\u000a Okay. I agree with, um, you, because that's what Hosni Mubarak was really, he was making excuse to, like, stay, um, him how, like, it is, to keep him as a president and re-elect him over and over, to, um... and he was telling them that he was following the constitution, because their theory said there was, like, no number of .\u000a Yeah, so he...\u000a I agree also, because, like you said, the example of Hosni Mubarak was the serious, serious excuse. They, um, the people were basically mad at them that, um, certain term, because they didn't give a number of the terms, so, um, that's why Hosni Mubarak made that excuse and wanted to take over.\u000a Very good. When, the point of staying too many years in power or in office, that brings to me something that's going on in other two countries. You remember any of the other countries in the Middle East, and Africa, that has something going on there? Because of this specific part?\u000a Libya and Yemen.\u000a What's going on in Libya now?\u000a They're protesting against, um, Gaddafi?\u000a Very good, yes. Good job. I like how you remembered his name. Why? Why they are protesting against him?\u000a Because he'd been in power for, like, about 43 years.\u000a Good job. Mm-hmm. Okay, what else is going on in another country? Or what country is having something going on?\u000a Yemen.\u000a Yemen.\u000a Yemen.\u000a Very good. Okay. Well, this brings us to go back again a little further, something about different types of governments. Remember, Egypt was a republic, okay? When their, the president stayed there for so many years, that will not be a republic country. That will be what?\u000a A dictatorship.\u000a A dictatorship. Very good. That will be a dictatorship. So the, the, the type of government is, if government is not a, the republic, or maybe democracy, as they say or claim, but it will be... it will be?\u000a A dicta--\u000a A dictatorship. Very good. And the people in power, the people in the office, government office, will be what? Dictators. Okay? It's because they do what they want to do, and they don't listen to other people. Okay, and what is another name for dictatorship, or very close to it?\u000a

V I'm not too sure if I like this screen print with the acrylic on top of it. I'm not too sure about that.\u000a It makes it less .\u000a It's different, in an awkward way. I don't know how to explain it. It doesn't have any depth to it. It has no dimension. Like, she's standing there, he has to take the paint and try to add dimension to it and then. . .\u000a It looks like she's laying down.\u000a Actually, yeah it does. I mean, he has to take the paint and try and add dimension to it, and then add the cool and warm colors to make it pop. And I'm just not feeling it. I like the Mick Jagger one, but I'm not feeling this Taylor Swift one. \u000a See, I like pop art. I just, I don't know.\u000a Did you notice that?\u000a What?\u000a I thought it was a green that goes in to, this. That's on them, it's more like a quiet, like she's sleeping softness. But I didn't notice it that it goes into purple, periwinkle, and this dark violet color that comes out of this red on the bottom half side. Did you see that? Then it goes in to two, and he breaks off the colors And it's like .\u000a All right, let's take a couple of minutes and try to just wrap up some of our questions. And then we'll talk about a whole group discussion, and see what we all have and what we want to write. \u000a In a sense, it would be a good picture for the stance that she's in. You know, the title of the album is called "Fearless," and we decided that it is a powerful stance she does look kinda fearless. In the way she's standing. The way he did it, it just doesn't look like her.\u000a \u000a It's like the wind's coming back and it pushes her hair. . .\u000a Yeah, but you would think that she would want to be looking directly at the camera.\u000a But then her hair wouldn't have been like that.\u000a Yeah, but they just need some big ole fans, it's Hollywood. You can get some big ole fans to blow your hair back. You would wanna be looking at the camera if you want to be looking fearless. \u000a You have to think. . .\u000a It's more of country music. I mean, I could see if you were saying like, hip-hop, pop. And you get like all forceful, "What's Up, I'm here."\u000a But they're saying, you know, she's a pop icon. If she's a country artist, then why are they putting her on pop billboards and pop charts?\u000a Because she's mainstreaming into the different areas, she's creating kind of a new version of country for the younger generations like you guys. You wouldn't compare her to Kenny Chesney. Those who want newer generation of country.\u000a Right.\u000a All right, let's just try and get to our last question and then we'll talk about whole group and get you back in here. Let's go ahead and start, you guys can chime in when you guys have an answer, if you want your input put in. So let's just talk about the describe section. What we really need to talk about is describing the scene in your own words. What kind of words would you use to describe this piece? Let's start with Mick Jagger.\u000a Bold.\u000a Bold.\u000a Proud.\u000a Proud.\u000a Electric.\u000a Electric. Okay, those are good ones. What about Taylor Swift?\u000a It's more feminine. More soft\u000a It's pale, it's delicate and .\u000a Delicate.\u000a Soft.\u000a You said soft.\u000a It's like he's almost scared when he's doing Taylor Swift, compared to Mick Jagger. Because Mick Jagger is all rough and boxes everywhere.\u000a I think he almost makes Taylor look almost intimidated. She's kind of pushing away--\u000a The position.\u000a . . .and you have all these colors around her. With the selection and. . .\u000a Innocence. Yeah, I think we talked about that with Taylor a little bit. You kind of have to look at the personality of each artist as well.\u000a Plus really you have to listen to her lyrics then it, like, paints a picture.\u000a She has an innocent expression.\u000a I'd say innocent, yeah. Okay.\u000a Fierce.\u000a You say fierce? Okay.\u000a It's like her personality, she just breaks it out with this bold pose.\u000a All right good. So those are some good words, key words to describe it. So, analyzing. Let's figure out and pinpoint specific elements and principles of design that we see in the piece that we want to discuss.\u000a Colors.\u000a Colors? Color's a big one. In both of them actually.\u000a Paint strips?\u000a The paint strips, it looks like it's a lot of paint. It kind of creates a lot of movement, with the way that it's flowing through the pieces. All right, so our big ones are color. . .\u000a He said in the video color is everything.\u000a And that's his main focus is color.\u000a The different colors make the value in the picture, the dark colors make the darker shades, and light colors.\u000a He uses more bold colors in Mick Jagger than he did in Taylor. And like the contrasting colors of Mick Jagger are more loud.\u000a I'd definitely say it's louder. Okay, good. Let's discuss the movement a little bit. So if you look at it, I see a lot of movement personally in the touch with the hair. I like how the hair is like that and I like her position from the side, because I think it adds interest. Like I was saying a second ago, if she was looking straight forward, I don't think the hair would have the same effect as it does from the side. And that's just my personal opinion, but I like how the hair is kind of flowing through and it's creating the movement through the piece. And then with the Mick Jagger one, the movement in this piece right here is really interesting to me. How he chose the green and the red to contrast each other. I think that's big bold move in this area. Good. Now what are our focal points?\u000a Faces.\u000a Faces? And what are the big things that factor in for that? Why is that? What did he do?\u000a The colors around her make her pop.\u000a The colors surrounding. If you look, the face is white right here, and then her skin tone is pale as well. So that kind of pops out against the bold colors. What do you guys think about the materials? The silk screen and the acrylic paint? You guys got to see a little bit of him working in the video, where he gets those huge rows of the acrylic paints from the jars, and just dipped in a couple different ones. And just started coloring. So what do you guys think about his process, and the materials he uses?\u000a He doesn't really choose what direction, he just kind of goes with the flow.\u000a It's very free, if you watch him.\u000a .\u000a Mindless. Mindless creativity. He does what comes to him, which is interesting. Any other comments about the actual process or materials?\u000a I think It would have been more amazing if he didn't use the silk screens.\u000a So you'd rather him just paint it than add the silk screen?\u000a I think it would be more like a wow factor.\u000a And some of his pieces are just paintings. More of the people though, like the Rollins he painted. . . And the ones he did for President Obama. President Reagan, some of the Statue of Liberty. And also some of the other people like Aerosmith, and the Beatles as well. And he's usually famous for painting his faces. And he would go into the color.\u000a

V All right. We've been talking about listening and viewing. I have our chart to help us out, and I wanna see if you can tell me what effective and respectful listening and viewing looks like. Matthew.\u000a Um, looking.\u000a Looking. Okay, so our eyes need to be...?\u000a  Watching.\u000a Watching. Christopher.\u000a Hands.\u000a Oh, what do our hands need to be doing?\u000a Still.\u000a They need to be still. Matthew Pelkey.\u000a Mouth shut.\u000a Our mouth shut. Our lips are...\u000a Closed.\u000a Closed. Collin.\u000a Don't lay on the carpet. Don't be silly.\u000a That's right. So tell me. Help her out, Jacob. Our feet what?\u000a Be quiet.\u000a Our feet need to be quiet. Maddie, can you help me out with one more? We've done eyes watching, lips closed, feet are quiet. What do we need to do? Who can help her out? Alice, I see your hand raised.\u000a Ears.\u000a Listening.\u000a Ears listening. And one more. Let me see if-\u000a Hands to yourself.\u000a Adam.\u000a Keep your hands to yourself.\u000a Hands are still. Okay, so let's do our checklist. We said eyes watching. Let me see those beautiful eyes. I don't see Layla's. I need you to turn your body. Very good. Next, ears listening. Does everyone have their ears listening? Next, lips are...\u000a Closed.\u000a Unless I call on you, just like I did with all of our helpers, hands are...\u000a Still.\u000a Still. So Catherine, I'll tie that shoe in just a minute. You put your hands still in your lap. Perfect. And our feet are...\u000a Quiet.\u000a Oh, I love it. Are we ready to view our video?\u000a Yes.\u000a Perfect. Okay. I want to be sure you can see before we begin, because we're going to turn out our lights. All right, what do we want to find out? I want you to watch for what type of weather you see. What are we watching for?\u000a What type of weather.\u000a Weather. And what tools are the children using to observe that weather? So the second thing we need to watch for? Tools. Listen and watch for the tools. And have we had an experience like that? So let me see those beautiful eyes. Let me see them. Face forward. Lights helper. Where's my lights helper?\u000a Claire.\u000a Claire, would you mind turning out our lights? Okay. Do we know what we're listening-\u000a Yeah.\u000a ...and watching for? Okay. Eyes forward. I'm going to be seeing who's doing their job. Ready.\u000a The wind is blowing my hair, but then it's very strong today. We decided to blow bubbles. They're blowing away. That's Oliver blowing bubbles, too. Oh, Amy's bubble just blew away. It was so windy, the wind is making the bubbles.\u000a The wind's pushing out the bubbles, and then the bubble comes out.\u000a We didn't even do anything. All we did is hold up the bubble wand.\u000a Whoa.\u000a You can't see the wind, but you can see what it's doing.\u000a That looks like fun.\u000a What are they doing?\u000a My dad gave us some old sheets to tear up so we could make some streamers.\u000a Is he having fun?\u000a That's Oliver, and the streamer just went in his face.\u000a What are they doing?\u000a Let's see what they're doing. Let's watch.\u000a I was pretending the streamers were the hair of this pig, because the little knot is really shaped like a head, and the rest of the stick is their body. And if they have branches growing on them, that's to me their hands and their legs, or something.\u000a All right. It was very short. Well, did you enjoy that?\u000a Yeah.\u000a I want to see that again.\u000a Good. Go turn on our lights.\u000a Again.\u000a Now. Oh, we might watch it again later. So let me see if you were listening and viewing our video. I'm going to check by answering these questions. Now, if you know the answer, what are you going to do?\u000a Raise your hand.\u000a Raise your hand.\u000a What weather did you see? Let me see someone I haven't heard from. Emily, what type of weather did we see?\u000a Blowing.\u000a It was blowing what?\u000a Bubbles.\u000a Wind.\u000a Wind. Blowing wind.\u000a What tools were the children using to observe the weather?\u000a Bubbles!\u000a Bubbles. And what did they do?\u000a They ripped the paper.\u000a They ripped them, and they put them on the stick. Have we had a similar experience?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah, for the bubbles.\u000a Yeah, let me see who's... let me see who I haven't heard from. Clara, what did we do?\u000a We blowed bubbles.\u000a We blew bubbles. Did we have to go like this?\u000a No.\u000a Did we have to do that?\u000a No.\u000a What happened when we put it in the bubble solution and put it up? What happened?\u000a The wind blew it.\u000a The bubbles blowed out.\u000a All right. So now we're going to do a think-\u000a  Pair share.\u000a I want you to turn to your partner that you talked to yesterday.\u000a Okay.\u000a I want you to share how you observed the wind. We had a lot of windy weather yesterday. Talk to your partner about where you observed the wind. Emily, she'll be right back. You be thinking. Jacob, what did you see yesterday?\u000a \u000a Wind. How did you see it?\u000a \u000a What did it blow?\u000a \u000a The trees? It blew the bubbles the other day. Collin, what did you see?\u000a \u000a Perfect. I like that. You used the tools we made in school. Marcus? Are you back? All right, we just got through watching our video, talking about our wind observations. Now I want you to tell me what effective speakers do. I'm going to call on some people I haven't heard from yet. Marshall, tell me one thing an effective speaker does.\u000a Speaks slowly.\u000a Speaks slowly. All right, let's see what else effective speakers do.\u000a They keep their eyes on the audience.\u000a Eyes on the audience, just like mine are on you right now. Bronwen, show that you're listening. Raven?\u000a \u000a Show your work. I want to see that beautiful work. Who else has read? Who can tell me another one? Who have I not heard from today? Who have I not heard from today?\u000a You haven't...\u000a Wesley. Wesley, what else should a good speaker do?\u000a Volume up.\u000a Huh?\u000a Volume up.\u000a Volume up. We want to hear what you have to say. All right. Clara, tell me something else.\u000a Be still.\u000a All right. Oh, you need to stand still. Should you sway back and forth when you're presenting your work?\u000a No.\u000a No. Okay.\u000a Have we covered it all?\u000a Yes.\u000a Let's see. Let's remind ourselves. Look at your-\u000a  Audience.\u000a Speak-\u000a  Slowly.\u000a Stand-\u000a  Still.\u000a Volume-\u000a  Up.\u000a Show your-\u000a  Work.\u000a Okay. Now remember, don't hold up your thumbs up sign until I ask if that person did these jobs. My first speaker is Holland. Holland, will you please come up? Okay. Okay, go ahead.\u000a I can see the wind blow a horse's..\u000a Huh? Horse's what?\u000a Tail.\u000a Okay. Did Holland look at the audience when she presented her work?\u000a Yes.\u000a What do you think?\u000a Good.\u000a Hold up those thumbs up signs. We want to give her good feedback. Put your thumbs up sign down. Thank you, Holland. My next speaker is Alice. Alice. Thank you for choosing a safe path. Come on. Good. All right. Let's watch our speaker.

What do you want?\u000a \u000a Wesley, please come up. Cathy, just look through your window. I know we're close today.\u000a I can see the wind blow the roofs.\u000a Did Wesley stand still?\u000a Yes.\u000a Yes. Good job. All right. Thumbs up sign if he, yeah, if he stood still. Good. Our next speaker, Sofia. Sofia, come up. Okay, let's start out like this. Loudly.\u000a I can see the wind blow .\u000a Did Sofia have her volume up?\u000a Yeah.\u000a She did a much better job. Let's give her those thumbs up signs. Good job. Oh, I don't see everyone's. Thank you, Adam. Good. Thumbs up sign down. Matthew Bashir.\u000a I can...\u000a Oh, hold on. Are your friends listening to you? Let me see if you're remembering, if your eyes are watching and your ears are listening. Christopher, we want to see you look at the speaker. Turn your body this way, please. Thank you.\u000a I can see the wind blow kites.\u000a Very good. Show your work. Oh, they've already got those thumbs up signs. Friends, do you believe that he showed his work? Is he showing everyone? Good. Why, thank you, Matthew.\u000a What does that say?\u000a Hmm?\u000a Why is the ?\u000a What is that? His kite is in the shape of a...\u000a Star.\u000a Star. Isn't that beautiful? I love those details. Catherine, your turn.\u000a I can...\u000a Oh, hold on one second. I'm sorry to interrupt. Eyes forward. Eyes forward. Good job.\u000a I can see the wind blow my star. I can see the wind blow leaves.\u000a She wrote two sentences. Show your work. Very good. Did Catherine look at her audience when she presented her work?\u000a Yes.\u000a Good. Thumbs up signs. Christopher, Romley, Emily, we want to see your eyes up here. Thank you. Aiden. Aiden. All right, Aiden, we're going to do a quick check. May I please have this? It's okay. Accidents do happen. I just didn't want you to get hurt.\u000a What get hurt?\u000a Because you're holding it... we want to be safe with our materials. Criss-cross. Very good. Aiden, I love the details in your picture.\u000a I can see the wind blow...\u000a Down.\u000a ...down the tree.\u000a Show your work. Nice. Oh, thumbs up signs. He spoke very slowly.\u000a

V  Who came up with the definition for radiation? Peter, you had a good definition, could you repeat that, remind us?\u000a I don't remember it exactly, but it was something along the lines of anything with waves that move, waves that are radiated, I mean.\u000a  Didn't you say it was waves that are spread?\u000a Yeah, waves that are spread by something, and they usually have energy with them. Like, the sun sends its radiation to the earth, in the form of light, heat, UVA, UVB rays.\u000a  Okay, so with that understanding, would you guys say that all radiation is harmful?\u000a  Not all.\u000a Yes. To a degree, all of radiation is harmful. But just, it depends on how harmful.\u000a But so then, what is like, when it's not harmful?\u000a It's very, very, very.\u000a Not, almost?\u000a It's almost negligible.\u000a  What types of waves that radiate, or what types of radiation do you associate with being not harmful?\u000a  Radio waves. \u000a  Any others, Jordan?\u000a Microwaves?\u000a  Visible light.\u000a Yeah, visible light isn't really that harmful.\u000a  What about microwaves, that's a good one. What do you guys think about microwaves?\u000a I thought they were dangerous, but somebody told me that they weren't.\u000a They're not really that harmful are they? I mean-- \u000a  You probably shouldn't stand in front of it.\u000a Saying they're not that harmful?\u000a They're not. I mean, I think probably like extended exposure to them would be bad, but I think that could be the same with a lot of things.\u000a  The door shuts when you use the microwave too.\u000a  What about then, where do they fall on the spectrum, what makes you think they're not dangerous? Or that they are?\u000a  Because they are longer than light waves.\u000a They've got longer wavelengths.\u000a  Which what does that mean?\u000a They have lower frequencies. They don't carry as much energy with them. Lower frequencies.\u000a  Let me consult my chart.\u000a  Okay, good idea. Or can anyone help her? What was your question Claire?\u000a Oh, I didn't have a question.\u000a  Oh, okay.\u000a What was the question? Why is she looking at her chart?\u000a Nope, same .\u000a We think they're not dangerous because they have a longer wavelength and a smaller frequency than light. Light is .\u000a  Okay good, so I think this is a good segue to the next question, which is, why are some electromagnetic waves considered dangerous to humans, while others aren't?\u000a Do you know what a segue is?\u000a  Okay. Which ones have more energy than others?\u000a Gamma rays and X-rays, and UVH rays?\u000a  Okay good, Peter did you have something you wanted to add?\u000a To what he just said?\u000a  Mm-hmm. Okay, good, and, can you repeat that, Sam?\u000a Some electromagnetic waves are more dangerous because they have much more energy.\u000a  Okay, good. So ultimately, what is that energy doing? Why is that harmful to us?\u000a Can stimulate cell growth .\u000a The more energy it has the more like, materials it can penetrate. Like visible light wouldn't really cut through you, but gamma rays could, like travel through skin. And X-rays can.\u000a  What did you guys learn about perhaps in biology? Cancer .\u000a Well that it's, when cells grow too fast, the abnormal growth of cells keep reproducing and...\u000a There's a mistake in the coding of the DNA, and then everything just goes haywire and, the cells, like what Caleb said, grow at abnormally fast rates, and they just take over that area and spread.\u000a Well yeah, they stop functioning as normal cells, and their sole function is to reproduce, and to continue growing and then they eat portions of other cells.\u000a  Okay, so what do electromagnetic waves have to do with this extra energy? This dangerous energy?\u000a Well wouldn't like, Cho said they would like stimulate the growth and, or is that not?\u000a Why do they stimulate growth?\u000a  Because they have energy.\u000a What does the energy do to stimulate it?\u000a  What were you going to say, Ronnie?\u000a Well, I just said that they trigger, they don't like stimulate, I mean cell growth to an extent is necessary . But they can trigger something dangerous, like with . I don't really have like the percent  or anything but...\u000a  What else might control cell growth?\u000a DNA?\u000a  Okay good, yeah.\u000a Lots of energy can. Can energy alter DNA? I feel like it can't.\u000a Well, isn't that what it's doing if it's triggering abnormal cell growth?\u000a I don't know.\u000a  Is anyone in here, have you taken, or are you taking  biology?\u000a I took it last year. I kind of remember what we talked about with cancer.\u000a  It's okay, and you guys have actually come to a good conclusion, that it does lie in the DNA, and that, you know, certain types of radiation can cause mutations in DNA that affect the cell cycle. So, when we think about cancer a lot of times, in light, or electromagnetic waves, a lot of times we think about skin cancer. And we talked a bit about that yesterday. We also probably notice skin variations among different people from different regions of the world. So, how does skin color variation, how do you think it relates to the amount of UV radiation that a particular population receives?\u000a  You mean based on their race?\u000a  Just based on their geologic background. Geographic background, not geologic.\u000a Well I mean, people with darker skin tend to not get sunburned as much as somebody with really, really pale skin.\u000a I don't think that's true, I think it's just that it doesn't show up as much, like you can definitely still get sun damage--\u000a No, of course you can still get sunburned, but I don't think it's like--\u000a  It's harder?\u000a I think so.\u000a  I think it's just less noticeable.\u000a Yeah, I think it's just less noticeable, I really don't think it has anything to do with-- \u000a  Okay, so you're getting the same amount, good, you're getting the same amount of radiation, sure.\u000a  Is sunburning caused by like the amount of light we absorb, our skin absorbs?\u000a It's actually, it's in their, Grace and Lana's video. About how .\u000a What did we do?\u000a On your presentation about sunburn. How sunburn works. I don't remember .\u000a  Okay, so ultimately I guess, I'll restate the question. So, how does skin color relate to the amount of UV radiation a certain population may receive? We see a lot of variation, so a lot of people often times say, "Oh, why do people in, "in countries that are near the equator, "Why are they darker, wouldn't that make them hotter?" Because we tend to think of dark colors as absorbing a lot of different wavelengths of light. Is that true, is that what's happening? It seems kind of...\u000a Wouldn't that make you sweat more then? Which would be good if it was hot.\u000a I guess sweat .\u000a  Sweat is just to release the heat on your body.\u000a No, but that's what I'm saying, like if you get hotter quicker, then you would start sweating earlier, which cools you down.\u000a  What is the pigment in skin that causes color variations?\u000a  Melanin.\u000a  Okay, good, alright. So, people who have darker skin, do they have more or less?\u000a They have more.\u000a It's in eyes, too, right? It's what causes eye color differences? Maybe I'm making that up, but...\u000a  What do you think the purpose of the melanin is? Is it to absorb, Grace offered one theory, what's another theory too there? There are several different reasons. What does it do to UV light? What's different about people that live say, in the equator regions, like the  and people who live up north?\u000a They don't get sunburned if they live there.  I mean...\u000a There's like nothing to .\u000a Yeah, exactly. People who live in northern climates are much more likely to get sunburned, because they're not exposed to that much sun, or their relatives weren't. And as they adapted they just passed on that trait of having fair skin. But, I don't know why. Do you know, Miss Roseborough?\u000a  Yeah, I have an understanding, yes. And when I think about it, I kind of think about the actual pigment itself, and what it's doing, and where it's located on the body. What it may be serving to do.\u000a  Doesn't it synthesize vitamin D for us?\u000a That would make sense.\u000a Yeah that's, vitamin D from sunlight, I guess that's why.\u000a  Okay, so people who have more melanin have, live in the sun, you know they have more exposure to the sun. Why do they need that extra melanin?\u000a  To protect them.\u000a  Okay yeah, so let's go with that, to protect them. From what?\u000a From the radiation like, I guess if you're out in the sun more, you need more protection, so like, it's kind of like a built-in sunblock.\u000a  What would it protect? So, it's on the surface, right?\u000a Protects the inner skin? It protects the outer layer, right?\u000a  Epidermis.\u000a  Yeah, I feel like Ewan brought up something like this yesterday when we were talking.\u000a Is that why they, you have lighter on your hands?\u000a Oh, I think that's the thing about like, gamma rays, for example, being more, like that was one of the  question, because they have more ability to penetrate through skin, and .\u000a  Okay, so really what's happening is the melanin actually absorbs the wavelengths of light that would normally penetrate the skin.\u000a How does it do that?\u000a  It just doesn't, the energy is just sort of dissipated as heat, and so...\u000a You get the heat but not the radiation?\u000a  Right, exactly, so it doesn't go further into your body.\u000a So, darker people get less sunburned than fairer people, because of that?\u000a Well, does it necessarily have to do with sunburn?\u000a And they're less likely to get skin cancer?\u000a  Yeah, I'd say they're less likely to get skin cancer.\u000a When you get tan, are you getting more melanin in your skin?\u000a  Yeah, what's happening when you get tan?\u000a So, shouldn't tanning make your skin stronger?\u000a Well--\u000a If it increases melanin?\u000a I don't think it's necessarily increasing it.\u000a  Because the tan goes away.\u000a Oh.\u000a So, it's like you have whatever your natural skin color is, then that is determined, how much.\u000a Okay.\u000a  Okay, so next misconception, that a lot of people have, or just something that I've always wondered about. I don't know if it's a misconception or not, but I'm thinking about colors that we associate with certain, just everyday things. So, when I go into the bathroom, when I go into the kitchen, I see red and that indicates the faucet that I turn for hot water, and blue for cold water. Why do you think those colors were chosen and is that always true?\u000a  Because fire is red.\u000a Water and ice is blue. It's not really blue, it's more clear.\u000a White and blue flames are much hotter than red flames.\u000a  Yeah, explain that.\u000a  I don't know, I guess back, a long time ago before they knew that--\u000a The hottest part of the fire is at the top, and if you think about a flame, usually you see a little blue or white part at the bottom, and then it's the red orange at the top.\u000a Which is where it would be the hottest.\u000a It's hottest at the top.\u000a But there's, at the top it would be starting to cool off as it gets away from--\u000a At the peak it's the hottest. But then the bunsen burner, the hottest part is like...\u000a Yeah, the hottest part of the flame is the top.\u000a You get a marshmallow, you put it at the bottom?\u000a No, sir!\u000a  What color is at the top, guys?\u000a  Red.\u000a  White.\u000a Or orange. \u000a Blue and white at the bottom.\u000a It's an experiment, Miss Rose, let's do experiments on fire.\u000a  That's a good idea, I think we should at this point.\u000a Do you have bunsen burners in here?\u000a  No, I don't have a gas source. So, let's just go back, I even broke it down, and I was thinking about well, where did this come from? I was thinking, what wavelengths of light are being absorbed by the color red, and what are being reflected by the color red? And so is the color red actually hotter? How could I relate that to temperature? How do you even relate a color to temperature? So, just the color red, what's it reflecting? What's it absorbing?\u000a What color does it reflect? It reflects red.\u000a And it absorbs green and blue. Or cyan.\u000a  Right, so, going back to the, what makes it that color, its natural frequency, what types of waves are causing it to change in temperature? What's happening as a result of different white light say, striking it, and its actual reflection and absorption of different waves of light? Would red or blue actually be hotter? As a pigment?\u000a Blue should be hotter, because it has more energy, it has the shorter wavelength and greater frequency.\u000a Yeah, Sam's right.\u000a  So, with a pigment? Think about a pigment first.\u000a What about it, just think about it?\u000a  Yeah, so certain wavelengths of light are being absorbed, and certain, wavelengths of light are being reflected. What does it mean when a pigment absorbs wavelengths of light? What happens to the energy that is being absorbed?\u000a It transfers to the medium?\u000a  Okay, good.\u000a I was going to say the pigment has the same frequency as those wavelengths, so...\u000a  Probably right.\u000a  Okay good, so it absorbs, so let's think about blue again. How could you apply that? What wavelengths of light does it absorb?\u000a  Shorter wavelengths than red.\u000a Well no, blue absorbs red and green, so this would be, longer wavelengths and lower frequencies.\u000a So, red would absorb the blue. Therefore it would absorb the higher frequency, had more energy, which means it would be hotter, right?\u000a  What do you guys think? Can you restate that?\u000a Sorry, because red absorbs blue, and blue has a higher frequency, the red would be absorbing the higher frequency, which means it would be getting more energy from the higher frequency. So, red would be the hottest.\u000a The man has a point. I agree with Peter.\u000a I agree with it, too.\u000a I agree with Peter.\u000a  Yeah, that's sort of the conclusion I came to, the only conclusion. Then I started thinking more, I was like, well how does this apply to stars? So, if I see a star that gives off a...\u000a

V Hello, guys. After all the hard work you've put in on doing your presentations, and your tri-board, and all the really cool stuff you've done, now we need to put it all together and see what you think about these energy sources that you've done all this research for. Okay? So, first off, doing a little poll. Which energy source do you like the best and think it would be the best one to use?\u000a Solar energy.\u000a Why?\u000a It looks pretty cool, and, I don't know, it seems like the most efficient way because the sun's always there and the sun won't run out--\u000a That's the word, whenever you're done using it--\u000a You can sell it.\u000a You can keep the energy from the sun from the morning and afternoon during the night.\u000a You can sell it.\u000a Okay, so he thinks solar. Who else?\u000a Okay.\u000a Go ahead.\u000a I like the wind.\u000a  Oh, so you can talk to him. Because you want to be able to talk to each other, right? I liked the wind one because it stored up the battery. And the battery, whenever it wasn't windy, and so it kind of was always there. It didn't matter about the wind.\u000a Yeah, you can answer the question.\u000a  I also think that wind's the best one because not only can you store it and have energy for whenever there is no wind, you can also make money off of that. So, maybe if you get it in enough homes, you won't even have to have a job. You can make money off that.\u000a  That's a very good point. That's a very good point, making money off of that energy source. Which other ones did we say could make money?\u000a Um, the solar. Solar can make money .\u000a Well, I like the wind. Because, it's like, the sun is going to burn up one day, but the wind is always going to be there. And the only bad thing about it is that the birds are going to die, but that's okay. \u000a  Okay, well, what are some pros and cons then? So, you just said birds would die if we use wind power, okay? Does that outweigh the benefit that you get from using wind power? \u000a I think birds dying isn't that bad, because, you know, we eat birds, so I don't think it would be that bad if birds do die. I mean, I don't think a lot of birds die because of the wind solar energy. Not as much as oil, or any of that other stuff.\u000a Yeah, or like we eat birds.\u000a The other one I like is the hydro one that James did, because-- \u000a  His was ridiculous. That was nice.\u000a  So, what part of it were you most impressed with? Like, not like the demonstration, but it was a great demonstration, but hydroelectric power in general, what part of that--\u000a  Like how if you have a pond or something, you can put it in there, and then it will power up your whole house.\u000a  Do we need moving water?\u000a Oh yeah, you need moving water to have that. You'd have to have a stream, but you could basically do it anywhere you have moving water. And if you really wanted to spend some money, there's also the pump storage plant from a high reservoir to a low reservoir.\u000a  So, that one actually sounds pretty good. So, somebody want to defend theirs, Rakif?\u000a I don't really like mine, because--\u000a  Which one did you do?\u000a  I did oil.\u000a  Natural Gas.\u000a  Oil and natural gas, okay. Why not?\u000a Because mine isn't as abundant as the wind or as the solar energy, so it's probably going to run out pretty soon. Like oil, natural gas, and coal do run out. They're not going to be as, here as much as the wind, or hydro or something like that.\u000a Well, there's a lot of dangers involved with using oil, right? Oil rigs, pipelines, lots of dangers involved, right?\u000a Oil prices can cause high gas prices.\u000a  That's true too. Remember in your presentation, you talk about some of the dangers. What were those dangers, and are those dangers any better or worse than some of the other dangers for the other energy sources?\u000a For oil?\u000a Yeah.\u000a The pipelines can burst, and they can kill marine life in the water if the oil gets out.\u000a They could cause another oil spill.\u000a Explosions.\u000a But coal, I know you're supposed to like stick up for your natural resource, but I kind of think coal can be good, but it's mostly bad, because a lot of people's lives are getting killed because of all the gasses, smells, and being down there for so long. And I think that's also very bad.\u000a And the land, it hurts the land and the environment.\u000a Coal is a very dirty resource if you think about it. All the coal dust, it can cause a lot of lung problems. So, the miners that go down there, they're risking their lives right?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Any of the other resources as dangerous as mining coal?\u000a No.\u000a  Nuclear energy.\u000a  What?\u000a Nuclear energy is the worst.\u000a  Okay, what about nuclear energy? How dangerous was that when you looked it up?\u000a It's a six out of ten chance.\u000a  Of what happening?\u000a It depends. It costs way too much, first of all, to build it.\u000a  It is very expensive. That's true.\u000a It's got a lot of risks, like if it gets into your water, or if you breathe in the radiation. \u000a  I imagine it could--\u000a  It smells bad. . \u000a  Okay, does collecting oil use more energy than it provides?\u000a  Good question!\u000a What do you mean by collecting oil?\u000a  Like, if you have to have the process of going underground and drilling the oil, does it use more energy than it provides?\u000a No, I don't think so. Because in my presentation, it said it produces like a widespread, like a very large amount of energy. And also that, your wave and tidal power powers our system, as you said in your presentation.  Oh, good point. Those two actually work together. When you talk about the wave and tidal power, that energy could be harnessed to run your offshore drilling. So, that's a very good thing as well.\u000a It's a benefit of drilling.\u000a Absolutely. Are there different energies that do benefit each other?\u000a Yes, the solar energy and wind. Because the wind energy is based off the sun, because of how the sun waves come onto the Earth and then it turns this sun mill, so it produces the turning of the mill, so the sun and solar energy and wind energy-- \u000a The solar energy and the wind, they actually work together, because I've seen some wind turbines that have solar energy panels on the top. One, then the other can go. That's okay.\u000a I think solar energy is a really good thing, because for a lot of power plants, like for times, the condition of natural resources like wind, even hydroelectric if there's a drought or something, or not enough water flow, you could always have the solar panels stuck on top of the plant, or anywhere.\u000a Right, because we've found that solar is pretty cost-feasible right?\u000a Yeah, it's not that expensive. And actually, you won't have to pay an electrical bill if you get that.\u000a If you were going to use solar panels to power a wind turbine or something, you're better off just using the solar panel.  It would just cost more money to have to get the solar panels and the wind turbine, or to have the solar panels power the turbine.\u000a It doesn't power it. It's just, like, another way to get energy at the same time that you're getting the wind. When there's no wind, there's not much of a wind--\u000a  That's what the battery's for. Hmm, interesting.\u000a I have a question for solar power, too. For solar power, how can I make aluminum more efficient in the future?\u000a Well, it doesn't use a lot of the gas, so it doesn't affect the environment. So, it doesn't affect your breathing. And you don't need solar panels, like you don't need to turn stuff on during the day, because the sun, through the windows, can give you light, and then can store up for the night.\u000a Okay.\u000a I have a question. What natural resource do you think will be the most used in the future? Like, 50 or so years from now? \u000a Wind. It was used like 3,000 years ago, so if it was used 3,000 years ago, I think it would be used 3,000 years in the future.\u000a That's not necessarily true, because it could get more worn out by the time 3000 years in the future comes.\u000a The problem with the wind thing is  it can be used in country, like rural areas, because in other areas, you can't put a wind turbine in a normal neighborhood. Because you can't, can you put one? \u000a You mean I could put one outside the school here? \u000a  Well, it would give energy to the school and the rest of the houses that are near the school.\u000a  Well, I'd put it on top of the school, because then there would be more wind higher up.\u000a Right, and we have to worry about spacing, right? Because we were saying wind power is built usually where? On wind farms, where you have a lot of flat land. Because if you build in a mountainous region, are you going to get a lot of the wind?   If it's high enough it'll  probably be enough.\u000a Then if you build your wind turbine high up on a mountain, what is the chance of that wind turbine maybe getting struck by lightning, or being damaged that way?\u000a  Yeah, that could be a real problem because of the wind and the way it could be struck down.\u000a Right, that's very possible. So, when you think about one  energy source, is there really one energy source to go with? Or do you have to take into consideration a lot of factors of where you live, what's available? Because, again, talking about building a hydroelectric plant we established you need running water. Is there running water everywhere around the United States?  No.\u000a No. And what's the problem if you flood an area, even if there is a running water, what happens if you flood the area?\u000a Well, they have to decide. Usually if it's going to be a major problem, they will actually dig a separate reservoir for the river to flood instead of it coming up on the banks of the river and destroying homes and things. That's mostly our United States rule. But, in China, they really don't care. So they flood three or four cities, multiple towns, fill up three gorges of water.\u000a Wow. That's just insane. Because once you disrupt water flow, you have a problem. So again, there are some pros and cons to these. Okay, we're going to take a second, and we're going to try to rank the resources in terms of which one you guys think is the best one to possibly use. So, if you had to pick one that you wanted to go with, whether there was running water, think you have those things beside you, don't limit yourself there, but turn to your neighbor for a minute, and discuss which one you think would be like 1 and 2. Because each one of you might have a different opinion. Give each other a little bit of a reason why, and we'll get back together in just a second. \u000a  Alright guys, another 30 seconds. Then we'll get back together.   Alright, three, two, one. Let's wrap up our conversations. Alright. How many people, by show of hands, went with one of the non-renewable resources, like coal, oil, or natural gas? Cool! So, everybody picked a renewable resource as the way to go. Alright, Ryan?\u000a I think it's either wind or solar power.\u000a  How many people agree?\u000a Oh, so wind or solar is the clear choice. Jonah, why?\u000a The thing is, I think solar would be first. Because solar energy, you can use almost anywhere, pretty much. But the wind, if you live here,  you can't get it as easily, because there's not as much wind. So, it would be a lot easier to have solar, because you can use solar anywhere, because the sun is shining pretty much everywhere.\u000a We think solar too, because the sun is always there, even if it is winter, or it's a little cloudy, the sun is still there.\u000a  Yeah, but what about at night time?\u000a  So, Maddy, what did we find out about solar?\u000a At night time, like a lot of people go to work during the day, so no one's at their house using their lights and stuff. So, there's a battery that stores all the energy and then you can come home at night and you can still power your house. \u000a You still get some light at night, bouncing off the moon.  Dustin, what do you think?\u000a I was thinking that solar energy would be great because I was comparing it to if you want to charge your phone, and you have it plugged in, and while it's plugged in it's fully charged and you can still use it, and it won't un-charge because it's still plugged into the wall. But, if the power goes out at your house, then it will stop charging, and you'll have that much battery left. So, it's kind of like if you're out in the day, and your house is charging while there's still sun. So, you're still getting energy, and at night time when the sun is gone, you'll have that energy saved in the battery of the solar thing.\u000a  Well, it's the same thing with wind power. You'd still have that battery there.\u000a Yeah. Wind power would be--\u000a Would solar power still work during a storm?\u000a It depends how severe the storm is.\u000a So, you mean this is, like, built to last.\u000a Yeah, if it gets struck by lightning, I don't think it would still work.\u000a  But, you know, when there are clouds outside during the day on a cloudy day, you know the solar radiation is still getting through the clouds, right?  So, that solar panel would still be getting energy from the sun on a cloudy day, just at night you would still have to use the battery that's been stored. Just like with wind power. There is wind power all day long, all night long, but sometimes it does die down at certain times, so there's a battery too, there as well. Exactly.\u000a I agree with solar power, but I agree that it would be great for being on your houses and things, but I don't see the purpose of a solar farm. It takes up a lot of land. Just the point to collect the sun, I think it would be better putting it on a house or combining it with another power plant, like wind power or something like that, because--\u000a  And cost-wise it would be probably expensive, because it was 900 for just one of those panels. And Miss Shonda said it would take about 12 just for one house.\u000a That's basically about 10,800.\u000a For one house.\u000a But we also think that solar panels blend in more than winter lines. Just imagine random winter lines in your front yard.\u000a Yeah, but we saw pictures, or a video, of a solar-powered house, and most people don't like solar panels because it looks unattractive on the top of your house. Same with the wind power, wind turbines would look unattractive. But you can still decorate them if you want. You can't really do that with the wind power, I mean solar power thing, because it's mostly black.\u000a  That's a good thought. So, going forward, thinking of an energy solution, because as you guys get older, energy is going to be something you have to worry about. We've seen the gas prices. The gasoline prices for regular cars go up. You've seen the ethanol being developed. Is it good to keep developing new technologies? How many of you guys, once you start driving, think if you could do it or your parents could do it for you, would drive a hybrid car?\u000a I would.  Okay, would you drive a hybrid car?\u000a Yeah, I would drive one, because it's more in miles per gallon, and with rechargeable cars, you can charge your car instead of using gas and spending more money.\u000a  That's good. Also the emissions from your gas.\u000a

V Okay, so for our first trial, we just wanted to see how long it would take for 25 milliliters of magnesium hydroxide to turn into acid by adding HCL, and it took 73.5 milliliters.\u000a And for our second trial, we had the same amount of milk of magnesia, but this time, we diluted it with 100 milliliters of water. And it took less HCL, hydrochloric acid than in the first trial that we did.\u000a And, the first time, we only added five drops of phenylthalene, and the second time we added ten drops just to see if it would make it different, and the ten drops definitely made it pinker, but we don't think it affected the results because phenylthalene is just the indicator, and not part of the reaction.\u000a You guys actually brought up a good point. How many groups added phenylthalene in large quantities?  How many think that you didn't add enough? Let's just ask that.  Or, how would you know if you added too much or not enough? Alright, go ahead, Will.\u000a Well, as long as it turns pink, you know that the indicator's working.\u000a  What if it's pinker?\u000a It wouldn't matter because it turns clear towards the end.\u000a  What do other people think? Alright, Vivian?\u000a I feel like if there's not enough indicator that when you add more and more HCL to the solution, it becomes, the pink color becomes so diluted that you can hardly tell when it turns clear and when it turns back to very pale pink. So, I don't think there's such a thing as adding too much indicator. Our group added about five drops, and that was enough.\u000a  Okay, what, Tad?\u000a Actually, adding too much indicator is bad for the experiment because that would distort the actual concentration of reactants. So, in an extreme case, if we added like 100 milliliters of indicator, that would definitely distort the concentration.\u000a  True, what do people think about that? Alright, Jimmy?\u000a The indicator doesn't participate in the overall reaction so it doesn't really make a difference.\u000a  What do people have to say to that? Alright, why don't you take Discuss, would adding too much indicator, would that affect your concentration? Like, in terms of volume, maybe you're adding to more volume of your reaction, would that affect the concentrations of your reactants?  Okay, thoughts? Alright, Jerry.\u000a I feel like if you added the indicator, it would dilute the solution because it would be somewhat like water, if you added, let's say, would change the concentration.\u000a  Okay, alright, Stephanie?\u000a I think it would, like, because if you started out with 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia, even if you add a lot of phenylthalene, it would still be 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia and that's what's reacting. So, I don't think it affects it.\u000a Alright, Mackenzie?\u000a Isn't pH determined by the concentration of hydroxide or hydrogen ions? So, if it's, it would be moles over liters, so if there were more liters, it would be a smaller concentration, right?\u000a Alright, Corey?\u000a It's mostly about the moles because if the moles of each of the acid and the base combine, they will neutralize. It doesn't really matter, the over liters, as long as the moles are equal.\u000a  Okay, Rick?\u000a Well, since phenylthalene is an indicator, it doesn't actually participate in the reaction, just like water, so adding it would just increase the volume which, as he said, which would dilute the solution. Adding a lot would have a profound affect, but adding a little bit wouldn't actually make a difference.\u000a  Okay, Richard?\u000a It would, because there's a lower concentration, it would take a lot longer for it to react, meaning that it greatly increases the risk of error. Because, when you're using a burette, it's continuously dripping so then, if you're swirling and it doesn't react as fast, then you have more that goes in before you actually realize it.\u000a So, those are all good thoughts that you guys came up with, and all reasonable. It does affect the concentration, and when you add a few drops, just like Vivian said, if you don't add enough, then it's still indicating, but in terms of the overall concentration, the concentration of the phenylthalene would be relatively small, and so that's why you see, like a very faint pink, but it's still indicating. Now, if you add more drops, of course you're going to have a darker pink, but the overall reaction volume would increase and so, if you add drops of phenylthalene, if you're adding like, five drops, compared to your overall reaction volume, it wouldn't be that big of a difference. So you would still have some source of error, but since you're only adding five drops as opposed to five million drops, five million drops could conceivably double your reaction volume and then your concentration on a greater scale would be affected. You know, it would make it so it's more diluted. Okay, does that make sense to everyone? Alright, those were all good comments. Anyone else have a comment? Alright, so let's go to table two.\u000a In last week's experiment, we were testing how much HCL it would take to neutralize 25 mL of milk of magnesia. First, we measured 25 mL of milk of magnesia using a graduated cylinder and add the milk of magnesia into the flask, and then we add three drop of phenylthalene as indicator to the flask. Then, we slowly used the burette to drop the HCL into the flask and it took us 55.5 mL of HCL to clear the solution.\u000a Every time we'd see that it's clear, it took the solution longer time. So, the first time, we stopped putting, we stopped adding HCL, but then it only took about one second to turn back to pink. But then, after the third or fourth stop that we made, it took longer than one second, so by the time it took, so like, towards the end, it didn't turn pink anymore.\u000a So, for the second trial, what we did, instead of using just 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia, we just used 15 milliliters, and diluted it with ten milliliters of water to see if there's a change in the amount of HCL we used, and it did, because it took a lot less, which was 35.5 milliliters of HCL as compared to the first trial where we used 55.5.\u000a So, we thought there might be a relation between the concentration of trial two versus trial one. It was roughly, 35.5 is roughly two thirds the amount it took for the m.o.m to come clear as over HCL, and we were kind of surprised by the results because we didn't expect it to keep going back to pink after it turned clear once.\u000a Do you think you did something wrong?\u000a Well, we kind of did, but then we remembered that this reaction was actually reversible, so then we tried it again and then we eventually made it all clear. \u000a Did anyone else, did any other groups think that, when the reaction was happening, that you had done something wrong? Or were surprised by the results? Alright, Ian?\u000a Oh, no, just saying yes.\u000a  Okay, anyone have a comment?\u000a We thought something was going wrong because it took a lot of HCL for the indicator to start working.\u000a  What do you mean start working?\u000a To start turning opaque, because it was pink for a long time. We had to add extra HCL to the burette.\u000a We actually thought that it wouldn't stop turning pink because we stopped it for about three times, stopped the burette from running, and every time it kept changing color. So, we thought that happened throughout the experiment.\u000a Did you think it was going to go on forever?\u000a Yep.\u000a Okay, any other groups? Alright, Andrew?\u000a We noticed that, yeah, what they said. It changed to clear, and then after we stopped stirring it it would go back to pink. We thought it was the reversible reaction rates, but then, like we were surprised at how big a difference it was, because it was really clear when we were stirring it, but once we stopped, became really pink.\u000a  Okay, alright, Will?\u000a There was also a transitional phase where it turned light, and we thought that was the phase it would turn into, rather than clear, so we actually stopped it there, but then we looked around and realized that people with a less concentration turned clear, so we started adding more.\u000a  Okay, alright, group three?\u000a First, we used 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia, and then we took 200 milliliters of water to dilute it and then we added five drops of phenylthalene. It took about 7 milliliters of one molar HCL to actually fully, huh? Yeah, it took 70 milliliters, and then it stayed clear from there.\u000a For the second trial, we want to see if we added less milk of magnesia, would it, would the time decrease? I mean the time to neutralize decrease. And so, we add 15 mL of magnesia and the same amount of H2O, and so we used up about\u000a So, I heard something about timing, because I heard the first couple groups timed some of the things. What did you guys time, and why did you choose to time that? Here, let's start here because you guys timed something. What did you time, and why did you choose to time that?\u000a Well, basically, I think we're just measuring the amount of HCL we used up, and see how many times we need to stop the burette for.\u000a Well, we observed that it kept changing from pink to clear but the more HCL we put, the faster it was, from the switch, so we kept adding HCL, and it turned all clear.\u000a It turned all clear, the faster--\u000a The previous times were milky white, and then towards the end, it becomes clear. Like, totally clear.\u000a Okay, did anyone observe something different, in terms of the amount of time that it took for it to turn back to pink? Okay, table six?\u000a As we added more HCL, the white color persisted longer and it took longer for it to turn back to pink.\u000a  Okay, so, yeah, Rick?\u000a I don't think time really matters in this experiment because the changing of the colors in the reaction depended more on the amount that was added, rather than the time you left it in there. So, if you add more, of course it's going to change quicker but it doesn't matter, like how long you have to wait for.\u000a So, you guys were saying that when you added the HCL, that it changed quicker to white, and then it took longer for it to turn back to pink. Okay, Gabriel?\u000a We timed it because we think that there might be a connection between the time it takes each time to turn back to pink and the concentration of the reactants because the longer it takes to turn back to pink might mean that there are less reactants and therefore, it will take a long time to get back to the reactions, right back to the products which turns it to pink.\u000a  Okay, alright, Corey?\u000a I was saying that it was faster turning back to pink.\u000a The reaction was actually, it was slower going back to pink. That's okay. Okay, let's go to table four.\u000a In our experiment, in our procedure, actually, we had two beakers of the magnesium hydroxide, and one beaker, we would heat, instead of diluting it, we would heat up one beaker to around 50 degrees Celsius, and we would perform the experiment with adding HCL using the burette, and in the other beaker, we would leave it in room temperature, which is around 25 degrees Celsius, and we would do the same procedure, adding the HCL with the burette.\u000a Our purpose for heating it was to see whether the reaction was an endothermic reaction or an exothermic reaction.\u000a What we found was that when we heated it, it actually, changing from pink to clear, it actually took less time than when we did it at room temperature, so we don't know if it accounts for the exothermic or endothermic, or maybe the molecules are just moving faster so it'll react faster.\u000a We also did not dilute the milk of magnesia like most of the groups did, so that may have skewed our answers a little as well. It took us a lot longer, and more HCL, to turn the solution clear again.\u000a  Comments? Does anyone think that, so this group didn't dilute. How many groups diluted and added distilled water? Okay, so all the other groups did.  Do you think that their data would be affected because they didn't dilute, and because you did? What are your thoughts? Alright, Nina?\u000a We diluted our second trial, and it didn't affect the amount of HCL needed.\u000a  Why do you think, well, from your observations, that's obvious, but does anyone know why? Or think why that might happen? Why would your data not be affected? Or think that maybe theirs was a fluke? And, your data should have been affected by diluting it with water? Alright, Joey?\u000a Is it because the HCL only reacts with the milk of magnesia? So, it doesn't affect how much water because it doesn't react with water?\u000a  Okay, what do you guys think? Alright, Katie?\u000a I think it will affect it because the concentration's higher and the milk of magnesia by itself is more dense so there's less surface area, I would say.\u000a  Okay, less surface area. Okay, that's a possibility. Alright, Gabriel?\u000a I think it wouldn't affect the amount of HCL that would be added, but it will just affect the time because with water, it will take longer for the reaction to take place because there's more volume, and without diluting it, their group just made it straight up so it would be faster for the reactants to go back to pink, and then at the end, it will just turn clear, either way.\u000a  Why do you think it would be faster if they didn't dilute it?\u000a Because there would be less volume, and the smaller the spaces, the molecules will react faster and have less room to move around.\u000a  Okay, reasonable, yep.\u000a So, our group kind of did both. We had a control, we redid the same experiment for number one, and then we measured how many milliliters of HCL it took, so if you change the concentration, it does affect the amount of HCL it takes to neutralize it.\u000a  Alright, Michael?\u000a We diluted it, and it took longer for us to, we added more HCL for it to neutralize, and I feel like if you dilute the milk of magnesia, there would be less molarity, and if it's not diluted, it would be a stronger weak base than if it was diluted. It would become weaker.\u000a You can't change the strength of an acid or a base because it's based on what, it's by definition. You can't make a strong base weak, but that's okay, Wintel? \u000a In our case we did two solutions, different concentration. The amount of HCL that's needed to neutralize the solution shouldn't be, should be the same, but in this case, the time delay causes the solution with low concentration to take more HCL because during the delay, the reaction, the HCL hasn't still reacted with milk of magnesia yet, and because of that delay, there's more HCL that's needed to compensate for that.\u000a Okay, so there's a little bit of stoichiometry going on, where the number of moles or the amount, the amount's still the same, regardless of whether, of milk of magnesia, regardless of whether or not you added distilled water or you didn't. So the amount's still the same.\u000a

V  Well frogs do sink, they do. It's sinking.\u000a What do you think caused that to happen, what made it sink that time?\u000a  I put it like that and...\u000a And then it was sinking. Alright, but now we saw some pictures where the real frogs got on lily pads and didn't sink. So, what do you think is different?\u000a It's like stuck to the ground and...\u000a The lily pad is stuck to the ground?\u000a Yeah, I think there's something inside. I think there's something in like dirt, you know, like that causes the lily pad to grow. But with something in the lily pad seed.\u000a  We were looking at this the other day. Do you girls remember about that? Okay, what were you all thinking about that.\u000a  They don't...\u000a  But what were you thinking Andrea? \u000a You know these eyes right here, we don't have eyes like this, but frogs... But frogs jump really high. If they don't jump really the same, they probably just almost jump if the momma and daddy frogs turn into, get some eggs and the tadpole comes out.\u000a That tadpole right there, he was following it and then he stopped. What if they took the flashlight, they might move.\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Like this, watch. When you take it off... I did this in my momma's. When you take it off and you turn it this way he looks back at it, like this. That's what he does.\u000a  How come?\u000a Because when tadpoles like eat things that glow, then when you take it off, you put it back on.\u000a  How come, why?\u000a I know, they just don't.\u000a  But that's not fair.\u000a  What else did you notice ? We did the spots. What else did you notice? Jamal, look at it again.\u000a Frog.\u000a  What body parts do you see?\u000a  Gray, polka dots.\u000a You said the spots.\u000a  The feet.\u000a  The feet, what about it ?\u000a  Lines on it.\u000a  Some lines on it. And what are you saying, Nikera? You said it had some things on it.\u000a  That white stuff.\u000a What is that? What is that white stuff on it's feet? See if I can get a closer look. What is that? Jamia, do you see that? The white things on its feet.\u000a  It's his foots.\u000a It's his feet? Do you have that on your feet?\u000a  No. \u000a  They need peace and quiet.\u000a If they don't have a calm river... Look, they live in ponds. Dude, listen, listen.\u000a There are trees right here. There's flowers.\u000a Listen. Latan, be quiet. I'm thinking that this is very calm rivers and this is what you call that ooey, gooey stuff that Ms. Robbie called it. That's the lake and that's the pond and there I am  frogs.\u000a They need grass, they need flowers, they need little trees, they need...\u000a I was thinking Aleha, thinking about us living in houses. We live in houses because can't breathe water. This is my house  and like there's dirt under there. And there's dirt under there. Then under that runs the water, the blue water.\u000a Let's add something to it.\u000a So what made it work this time?\u000a  It stands upside down. The frog floats. It doesn't jump on any kind of one, it only jumps on the ones that are round. Because it needs something facing up to make the walls.\u000a  Because this is facing up, so you think maybe the lily pad faces up.\u000a Right, if it does this it needs like a shield so the water won't get in because if the water touches it, it will tear and it will sink.\u000a  Did you listen?\u000a Because they need something on it like rain.\u000a  So you're saying if water touches it, what happens if water gets on top of it?\u000a It'll sink because it'll tear the lily pad up and it'll sink, but with the flower on it, it does not sink.\u000a  So if it has the flower, you think the flower keeps it from sinking.\u000a Because it's stuck. It's stuck and it's so hard, it makes it so hard and rainy and it dries up.\u000a  So, when you dried the frog off did that make a difference?\u000a  Well, it doesn't make a difference. Frogs like to be wet.\u000a  Frogs are usually wet.\u000a  That frog is an African swimming frog because look at it's feet.\u000a  It does look like an African dwarf frog.\u000a It jumps on the water. It can run and hop on water.\u000a  Andrea, what did you notice about this? What did you notice?\u000a  I know that we have .\u000a  It doesn't float. \u000a  Let me show you which one.\u000a  Which one?\u000a  What about this one?\u000a  He was growing legs.\u000a  No, this one's growing legs. \u000a   but that's what tadpoles swim in. Okay, you see them?\u000a Shine it on it.\u000a  No. You see they're moving because they're growing legs. \u000a  If you yell really loud the glass will break and then the tadpoles . \u000a  Frogs. The frog's body.  \u000a  There's a water snake. There's a water snake. A water snake. \u000a What are you talking about over here?\u000a This thing has a frog in it.\u000a And he just swam.\u000a  Okay, so we're talking over here.\u000a Ms. Robbie, look.\u000a So, you're comparing the pond to your house.\u000a Yeah. \u000a  Alright, did you see this that she found out? It says the frog is pulling off its skin. I wonder why it's doing that.\u000a Because, so it can have different skin.\u000a Why would it make different skin?\u000a It might need different skin because of the way it lives. The way it lives, it has to take off its own skin, just like a snake takes off its whole skin. Snakes take off their skin.\u000a Be a new frog.\u000a The way they take off their skin is they shred it off. They don't have any arms. Snakes shed their skin off and they don't have no arms.\u000a Snakes shed their skin?\u000a  Yeah.\u000a Do you think frogs shed their skin too? What do you think Aleha? You found the picture, tell me what you're thinking. Let me hear Aleha.\u000a When it gets old they have to take it off.\u000a He has to take it off. Why do you think he needs to take his skin off?\u000a I was thinking...\u000a Just a moment, Daniel, let me hear Aleha, I can't hear.\u000a When it gets too rough on him, he can take if off.\u000a  Maybe if his skin feels rough. Hmm, I'm wondering about that. That's giving me something to wonder about.\u000a Ms. Robbie, there's a water beetle.\u000a Yes, but we're still looking at this about this frog coming off. She feels like maybe when his skin is rough he takes it off. What did the page say? It uses a word I'm not sure about, molt. It said frogs molt a few times every year.\u000a Because it's the way they live.\u000a  It's the way they live.\u000a But we don't live that way, the same way we do. We get bigger instead of shredding skin.\u000a You're right. We get-- What, what'd you say? Say that again.\u000a We get bigger.\u000a  We get bigger.\u000a And they shred.\u000a  And they shed their skin.\u000a That's opposite.\u000a Hmm, I'm going to write down that word molt. We're going to talk about that a little bit. We're going to try to explore that a little bit more. \u000a The frogs are underground and they hatch out of the eggs and turn into the tadpoles and they're going to grow up a little and they're going to lost their tail and they're going to turn into an adult frog and then they are underground when it's winter.\u000a  When it's winter they're undergound. Okay, what have you all found out about comparing?\u000a  The frogs protect their babies.\u000a Do the frogs protect their babies?\u000a No, they don't. What about your ?\u000a They wait until they hatch.\u000a  They wait till they hatch.\u000a Frogs have bigger eyes than us because they have those eyes like that on their heads and we don't.\u000a And we have eyes that are small. And when you were born did your mom or dad take care of you or your grown up?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  I went to my grandma when I'm a baby.\u000a Okay, did your grownup take care of you when you were a baby, Andreas?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Yeah, well what about the mother frogs?\u000a No.\u000a  I got a lot of food I love.\u000a You got a lot of food.\u000a  I eat chicken and rice, everything.\u000a Andreas just think about our tadpoles. Is the momma frog in here taking care of those tadpoles?\u000a  No.\u000a  They wait till they hatch.\u000a Maybe the momma frog missed them.\u000a  Probably if they die after wintertime...\u000a

V Consider what you read about organic lettuce and Rosie from Omnivore's Dilemma and from what you're reading do you feel it's worth the extra cost and effort to eat organic? Yes?\u000a So, for some organics I believe it is worth it and others I don't. Industrial organic I don't believe it's worth it, because for the lettuce in the book Omnivore's Dilemma, they said it takes about ten fossil fuel calories to make one calorie from lettuce, and I don't believe that's energy efficient at all. But other farms, other industries, or other organic farms like Polyface Farms, they use all natural energy, not a lot of fossil fuels go into it, and I think it's more efficient. So, organic like that I believe is better, but industrial organic I don't believe is better.\u000a That's a good point. I was wondering is somebody could expand on the difference between industrial organic and organic. Phil, if you want to pick someone.\u000a Eli.\u000a So, normal organic food, like what started the idea of organic food, was completely different from organic food that you buy at Whole Foods nowadays. Like, what the people originally thought the concept of organic food thought of was like the local, sustainable farm like Polyface Farms, where it's completely energy efficient and they use all natural resources like grass and just stuff like that to feed their cows and other animals. But industrial organic systems, it's pretty much the same as normal industrial food system, except they don't use antibiotics or pesticides to make their food. They still have animal rights... There's still animal cruelty and stuff inside the the factories, and stuff like that. Araceli.\u000a I agree with Eli, because when I read organic, I thought organic was good. But then basically it was the same thing. Like the chickens, they still got fed corn, but they had an open door, but they were so fat they couldn't go through. Like, why pay the extra money for something that's going to be exactly the same as the other thing?\u000a I think it is worth buying organic food. Because even though the animals are treated the same, and even though it still wastes a lot of fossil fuel, we save a lot of farmland from being put, like, pesticide and everything on it, so we could have chemical free land. And also we save our water system from being poisoned by the chemicals we use. So, it might cost a little bit more, but it's worth it. Matt.\u000a In response to, I guess, Eli, it's not exactly the same, there are definitely the perks to the industrial organic system with the lack of chemicals and hormones. But yes, I can definitely agree that it's a very similar thing, it doesn't solve all the problems with the industrial system.\u000a I don't agree with what was just said, that when you farm without pesticides it's better, because in Omnivore's Dilemma, even though they farm without pesticides, they crowd the ground so much that it destroys the land. So, it's not necessarily better, it just sounds better.\u000a I just like Simone's point, because I think that a lot of the problems are still there, and even though it might be a little bit better without the pesticides, I think it's still important to eat real organic food. I think that would be the best. Industrial organic is a step in the right direction, but I don't think it's close enough to where we should be with our food system.\u000a I agree with Molly that industrial organic foods, on the face, are both... They're worth paying for because they're the food that we should be eating, but in other ways they feed into other problems with pollution. If you want the right type of food, you have to create a food system that can sustain a country as large as the United States, but still has healthy animals. And animals that have evolved to eat, only being fed, that is at a cost low enough to feed everyone in the United States like we are fed now.\u000a I was going to also ask a couple personal questions, since I was talking to your mom about how does your eating habits change, do you think, now that you feel like you're more aware, or...?\u000a She says that she always bought grass fed beef, and I try to eat healthy, but in the case of fast food, of course, I go and eat fast food. But lately I've been badgering her, and asking her if she could get a grass fed steak. I've been waiting for that for a long time. The corn fed steak that my dad gives me smells bad and it looks bad, so...  Anyway. There's nobody asking.\u000a I don't think organic's really necessarily healthy for us, because humans are still trying to figure out what vitamins we still need, what essentials we still need. Like people are still discovering that plants have certain essentials that we never knew we needed. So, how can we tell organic's good for us if we don't know what organic is different from what we get from normal food?\u000a I thought Curt brought a good point up too, which is the best organic is just straight from the farm to the buyers, but it is a great point that Curt and Greg brings up which is that that way can't feed as much people as the industrial organic or just industrial food.\u000a I completely agree with that. It's implausible to try to make what they call beyond organic food at such a high amount, because it really consumes a lot of land and a lot of energy. We read in the Omnivore's Dilemma with the moving the chicken coops so much every day, that's a lot of land for very little meat, and honestly that would not be able to sustain the whole country. Lisa?\u000a So, I kind of agree with what you're saying, but it doesn't have to necessarily be a few big farms that are completely going organic. If there's little farms all over the United States, then meat can go to those people  around there. It might not happen all of a sudden, but little by little people are going to learn that organic is better. Whether it's more expensive or not, it's healthier for us knowing that the animals... When the animals are not fed on natural stuff, that in turn is bad for us. Ashley?\u000a I agree with what everyone said, and that the point that Paulina brought up about we're still trying to figure out what vitamins are what and what's good for us. Because I feel like it's more better to spend even just a few more cents, if organic food isn't that expensive, and go to certain places. A few more cents on the local, home grown organic food, because I used to buy meat from the... What's it called? The meat section.\u000a  The deli?\u000a Deli, yeah, there you go. And I used to buy meat there, and I thought it was all fine, you know, whatever, until I went to the doctor one day because I was getting really injured, and she was like, "You're missing all these vitamins," and she gave me all these vitamins to take. And I didn't know that that was missing inside my food, and then I go to the organic section of the supermarket and it's not even, like, vitamins that were missing in the meat, it's vitamins that were missing in the drinks that can be found in organic food. For example, like the naked juice has these vitamins already included in there, just because it's, like, naturally grown and organic. So, I was willing to spend the extra dollar for my health. So, I feel like if people realize how important it is for your health, that scare will wake them up and they'll be able to spend the dollar.\u000a Okay, well, I agree. I think that it's worth the extra cost for organic, because, like, in the book it said when we buy organic food, we're voting with our forks, and we're voting for the type of food we want. And if we go organic, then the producers will think that most of us want organic, so they'll start growing more and selling more organic food, so that it might become cheaper in the long run.\u000a I personally don't really care.  Like, if it's cheaper, that's cool, because if it has pesticides on it you can just wash it off. And animal's rights are nice, but they're going to be killed anyway. It's like, they're all going to die anyway. They're going to die, so... Michael.\u000a I like it.  And yeah, I mean, even though organic's good, we still have a lot of cheap food that feeds a lot more people that have lower income. So, we might not be, like, the healthiest nation, but at least we give an opportunity to feed every single person in the United States. So, I kind of like that. They don't have to worry about paying high prices for food, even though it's bad for my health. And even if it is bad, I could just exercise.  So, I think it's a personal responsibility to watch what you eat. So, we should be open to that.\u000a Even with the industrialized food system, we're still not feeding everyone. If you go to like, the Appalachians and stuff like that, you still have kids that are starving every day because their parents don't make enough money to buy even the cheap food. So, I think that it's not that we need to focus less on the cost of everything, and just figure out a better way to produce food and grow it, and to make sure that it gets where it needs to go. I think we need to worry about cost later on, and try and focus on a way to do that in the short term, so that in the long term we can feed as many people as we need to. Lisa.\u000a I see how you brought up the Appalchians, but my question to you is is it more important to worry about issues here, where it effects us, or would you find it more important to focus, like, worldwide? Like, you could focus on problems that people have outside, but, like, wouldn't you  focus on start here, make sure that we have what we need first, and then branch out?\u000a I think that with that, like, with a lot of people who get stuff locally... So, if you're saying locally like, are you talking, like, Chicago?\u000a Don't you think it's better to start locally and then... Like we get better locally, and then we get better statewide, and then we'll go on until everybody has enough money to do this, or their food, everyone can buy their food.\u000a I think so, but you also have to take into consideration that even if we do something in Illinois, that doesn't guarantee that other states are going to adopt the same policies. And I think if we focus on doing something for United States, and worry less about the other countries, even though, politically, it might not be the right thing to do, worry less about the other countries at this time. But I think we need to take a step back and focus on just fixing as much as we can on a whole, and then going down into the smaller levels and seeing, okay, how can we make this better on a local level? Chris?\u000a I think that we can't really make it perfect, like the way Polyface Farms is, because of how the cities are laid out. Because the cities are too big to have farms in reasonable reach of the people there. So, I think what we have to do is have this industrial organic, which still is, I mean, a lot more worth it, because it keeps the biodiversity in the soil, and I read in the book they said something like that the size of the state of New Jersey was, like, a dead zone at the end of the Mississippi River and the Gulf from all the pesticides and fertilizers that flow down. And that's  problem that we should focus on.\u000a Well, I agree with Teresa that we should start only in the US, because we can't just make a generalization that other countries are using corn and are eating unhealthy just as we are. We only know that the US is eating unhealthy because, according to Omnivore's Dilemma, King Corn, and Food Incorporated, the problems are only occurring in the United States. So, if we want to solve this problem, we should start from the origins, because we started using corn massively, creating problems, and stuff, not because of other countries. Well, maybe because we imported corn from Mexico and they dominated out other corn types, so we started using corn. But we should start focusing on more of what's the problem over here, instead of other countries, because we have to solve our own problems first before we become worried about other problems, maybe. Yeah.\u000a I was going to say that it is worth it to spend the money in organic, because even if it's just a little bit of farms here and there, people seem to be willing to travel the extra mile just to get that healthy piece of food. Like in Polyface Farms, people came from hundreds of miles, I think, or 100 miles, just to get their healthy chickens or the healthy food. And with Jerry, I wanted to say that... Well, nevermind. \u000a Okay then. So, I remember Gabby said how we should be focusing on making as much food as possible for everyone in America, and that's the issue we should be working on. But that's really what the food industry does, like making the most food possible. They pretty much put everything else aside, besides mass production. They don't really care about animal rights, or worker safety, or anything like that. They just put as much work as they can into making more food, and like Gabby said, people in America still can't afford this food that's cheaper than it's ever been in the past. So, it just shows that, really, we can not go back to just normal farms, because there's no way just natural farms like Polyface could ever sustain a population as big as America. Like, we kind of dug ourselves into a hole. Yeah.\u000a Okay, so what do you think we should do then? If we've dug ourselves--  If we've dug ourselves into this hole, even though if we're going to be producing less food that's better quality, I agree that is better, because then you're taking the animal rights into consideration, the workers' rights and everything. But then either we have to figure out a way to change how people eat, and so people are eating a bigger variety of food, or somehow figure out a different way to be able to feed everyone. Because, at the end of the day, either we're going to have a lot of people who die because we change this, and we change it too fast, and we're not ready to adapt to it, or we can do it slowly and try and figure out ways so that everyone somehow survives. Eli.\u000a Okay, well, I think that we should really just follow the model of, like, France, or some other country in Europe or something. Because they have a way better... People in France are so much healthier than people in America, and they don't eat nearly as much food. They still aren't starving, most people in France aren't starving or anything. So, there are countries, it's just not left them.\u000a Okay, I don't know if this makes sense, but if they have, like 20,000 chickens in one pen, do they have to feed them corn? Like, what's wrong with mass production, but making it a little healthier? Why can't they just give them something else that's maybe not all corn, maybe half corn, or half corn to little corn? And then, metaphorically speaking, this totally reminds me of Hitler, and, like, how he took over all the people and made them work to death and everything, and that's like what they're doing with the animals. They're just working them to death, and they have no rights or happiness whatsoever. Deja?\u000a I think the answer to your question is that most people just want money, so they'll buy whatever's cheapest and pay low wages to people just so they can make a lot of money. I think that's the answer to your question about why don't they just choose another food instead of corn. I think it's because of money.\u000a But also consider, what about... What about the industrial organic? Doesn't that address this whole problem of how the chickens are fed? Even though they're raised in coops?\u000a  They're still fed corn. \u000a Molly.\u000a Okay, so I think that it's a really good idea that Matthew brought up a while ago, that the industrial issue, it can't really be solved by using beyond organic. I think we've moved on from that. We can't really go back to beyond organic, because we wouldn't be able to feed enough people. And then just to Adam's point, I don't think that we're not producing enough food. I think the problem is that the people don't have enough money for the food. So, I think that producing more food wouldn't really help.\u000a  I was going to say, everyone keeps talking about mass production and that view would feed everybody. But if you think, we actually waste a lot of food too. That's actually important. I think we saw a picture or something, all of it gets thrown out every day, or they have ads on it on TV. If we're so worried about feeding everyone, why don't we eat better ourselves, and stop buying so much food we don't actually eat?\u000a Well, either, whether you guys want to change it locally to outside or outside to inside, I like the idea that you guys think about spreading the idea. Whether it's taking France's ideas and taking it onto ourselves, or just ourselves spreading it out. Because  so obnoxious, they would go out to McDonald's, my family, and be like, "Do you know what that eats?" And then just start talking. We're like, "Shut up, don't tell me what it eats. "I'm going to eat it." And now my mom asks me, she's like, "Is this good?" And then I read it, I'm like, "Yeah, "it has this and this and this." And now she turns to me and, like, asks me should we buy this, should we not? So, I think I have changed a little bit at least, having been\u000a

So, wait, what order these, do these rings show up?\u000a What order?\u000a Yeah, like, what's the procedure when this was like, like this, and then this one, or then this one?\u000a They start small, and bigger, and bigger.\u000a So, drop your pebble in the pond, there you go.\u000a And it gets bigger as it goes up.\u000a  Okay, and so now, maybe talk through...  Maybe talk through what is the given, what's the constant rate of change, where you're looking for it, and how would that be seen, visually?\u000a So, the rate is increasing constantly at one foot per second.\u000a Per second. The ADT is two pi R, BR, the first.\u000a  Which one are you guys on? Number one, okay, good.\u000a In order for you to find for QR, may define the ADT.

Show me what happened here.\u000a  Okay, air is gonna come into the clear hole, and then right into...\u000a You picked the sand problem, tell me about your sand problem.\u000a It's talking about sand quality to a, how to apply it at a rate to be permanent.\u000a Okay.\u000a And out of the following, the diameter of the base in it. Is...\u000a  It's going to make the shape of a cone when you pour it in one spot, that's the idea.\u000a  And the shape of the cone will be approximately three times however high the sand is being poured from.\u000a Okay, so, our cone has been smooshed, but you see how it's still kinda narrow, a little mountain in sort of the shape of a cone?\u000a Right.\u000a And what's the unknown, what are we looking for here?\u000a We're trying to find the rate of the height of the pile.\u000a  Oh, you can do it.\u000a We said that's possible.\u000a Okay, so, Kathy, you're able, would that be DVDT, DHDT, DRDT, all these DTs, we can kinda run together?\u000a  Just blow it up?\u000a Can we do AHDT?\u000a Sure, AHDT because you're looking for a rate of change for the height. Now, you're actually on the hardest problem. This is the trickiest problem, and you have correctly chosen the cards for these. But, here's what makes it tricky. I want you to read through this slowly, and let's figure out the unknown, and if they give us, what other rates they give us. Now, you actually just told me what the unknown is, right?\u000a DHDT?\u000a DHDT. Okay, what other variables do we have on this card besides DHDT and the rate of change?\u000a AR, ARDT.\u000a ARDT, and DVDT. Okay, now, you read it again while y'all are listening and see if you can pick out, maybe do DVDT or DRDT.\u000a What was that?\u000a For both.\u000a At a sand and gravel plant, sand is falling off the conveyor and onto a conical pile at a rate of\u000a Plus? What information did you just get? You can say it again if you need to.\u000a Sand is falling off a conveyor and onto the conical pile at a rate of 10 cubic feet per minute.\u000a Okay. Good, that's DVDT 'cause it's the amount the volume changes, and the label kinda gets screwy, too, right? Okay, so now, we're listening for DRDT. We hope we hear DRDT because we need that also, right?\u000a The diameter of the base of the cone is approximately three times the altitude. So... \u000a Okay, so it's giving us information about radius compared to altitude, but it doesn't seem to be giving us DRDT, right? Which means we don't have DRDT.\u000a  And the radius is two feet.\u000a And the radius is two feet.\u000a  So, what's the height again?\u000a It's the height of DT. So, we need to find how fast the radius is changing...\u000a So, this right here is the decision.\u000a Nice. The DVDT equals four pi R squared to the DRDT.\u000a  So, this is the hardest when you get to the math.\u000a  What we need to find is DRDT when the radius equals two feet.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  All right.\u000a  Okay. I guess the next one we can figure out right now...\u000a How many cubes we got?\u000a Three.\u000a Three, okay. All the edges of the cube are expanding at a rate of three centimeters per second. How fast is the volume changing if each edge is one centimeter?\u000a  We have you doing the edges of a cube, the radius of an aired balloon. \u000a So, the radius, one...\u000a 370\u000a 370?\u000a 370.\u000a So, D, DS over DT is three?\u000a Right.\u000a Plug that, we can just plug that in 'cause it's not a constant.\u000a Tell me a little bit about the problem you're on. Does it have three cubes in your problem? Like, why does it have three cubes in the box?\u000a We started with that, this other one.\u000a  Okay.\u000a And it shows after a second, it would be that big. And then after another second, it would be that big.\u000a Oh, good, okay, so, it's showing that it's the same cube, and it's getting bigger. It's like three stages in an environment. Very good, very good. Correct interpretation. Yes.\u000a And... It also shows the volume of the... \u000a Now, what does this question ask you for at the very end? What are you gonna be trying to find?\u000a How fast the volume changes when it enters from...\u000a Yes. I have a question for you, here's a think about it question. Cause you're finding DVDT when it is exactly one centimeter, right, that's what the question's asking? Do you think DVDT would be greater or smaller when it's past one centimeter? Do you think the rate of change of volume will be getting bigger faster, or will it slow down?\u000a Slow down.\u000a Slow down.\u000a Slow down.\u000a My challenge to you is after you do the math problem and you have your equation to work with, try two centimeters and see if you were right. Yeah, so, go above and beyond the question. Was your conjecture right, or were you like, oh, no, we were backwards? Kay?\u000a Okay.\u000a  The base is gonna be point oh eight with the ball, at a descending rate. And it is asking how fast the pouch is moving to the wall in the last part.\u000a  Oh, you look great.\u000a  D two? So, okay, let's pour the sand again. So, what, five? So, it's pouring at 10 cubic feet per minute.\u000a  Talking about the change in output. \u000a So, what's constant?\u000a Its cubic feet per minute.\u000a So, that's the...\u000a The sand being poured in it.\u000a So, that's the volume? I don't know. Okay. We have choices as to who can't...\u000a I have four. And zero to bring it down. Yeah, I'm just gonna bring it down.\u000a  Problem number what? Problem one?\u000a  Okay, next problem. Are we agreed?\u000a A ladder 25 feet long is leaning against the wall of a house. The base of the ladder is pulled away from the wall at a rate of two feet per second. How fast is the top moving down the wall when the base of the ladder is 24 feet from the wall?\u000a So, then...\u000a  You definitely got the demonstration item perfect, that's right, that's exactly what's happening.\u000a All right. Okay. You guys are gonna get this one. It's what's supposed to be a... Length.\u000a  And what made you pick that one?\u000a  It's the Pythagorean theorem.\u000a  And then why would you wanna use the Pythagorean theorem?\u000a  Because it's a three sided, it's equal to the right triangle.\u000a  Yeah, exactly, uh huh.\u000a  All right. \u000a Okay, now I've got a question for ya. Is there any part of that equation that will always give confirmation we want to, that you would actually be able to substitute a number in at the very beginning? Okay, good, good.\u000a All right.\u000a What would that mean about your derivative card? What would you know for sure? If you put 25 right there.\u000a  Get a constant rate of one foot per second.\u000a Anything special for this derivative card?\u000a DZ over DT equals...\u000a  Well, if the original, if your ladder is 25 right here, where would the 25 originally be put?\u000a  In the Z.\u000a  In the Z, okay. I that would say that X squared plus Y squared equals 25. Now, take the derivative of this with respect to time. Would it look exactly like this or a little bit different?\u000a  One, we're at a constant rate.\u000a Right. And so, when you do your math, you can go ahead and put that as zero, and then just work with those. Good. That's good.\u000a  So...\u000a  What's the...\u000a The balloon's increasing.\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Following the radius.\u000a It's the, what's the radius, it's four feet. The radius, yeah, you have to find what the radius is at four feet, and...\u000a  Find the radius when it's at four feet.\u000a  Which one are you on? P two?\u000a When the radius is four feet, at what rate is the total area of the disturbed water treatment area? So, you would define the area.\u000a  Wait, which, are you on... Okay, so you have three balloons.\u000a  Right.\u000a  And you could use those three balloons if they are different sizes to show what?\u000a  Okay.\u000a  Okay.\u000a  The rate of change. So, if you have one balloon and put one back into it, and then that's when you have...\u000a Okay, let's see what they look like. So, let's see if we can have different stages of our balloon here. You look like you must be at the last stage 'cause that looks pretty big. Okay, that must be the beginning. That looks like the beginning, too.  Can one of 'em get middle stage? I think you've got the baby balloon, though, I think that's the biggest that guy's getting.\u000a I didn't know they were different sizes.\u000a Yeah, they are actually different sizes. One more. Do it! And you let some out, maybe you got it. Oh, perfect, okay. Tell me about what's going on with this balloon. What's goin' on?\u000a Oh, increase...\u000a Four cubic feet, and they...\u000a  Oh, what are they?\u000a I think I'm thinking of the wrong one. Like, it's not...  Like, it's not measuring each breath, it's something...\u000a No, you are thinking right. This is, is this like what we had?\u000a Two days ago?\u000a Yeah, a couple days ago. Like, is, what was constant a couple days ago in our activity?\u000a Air is being continuous air pulled away by the rate of...\u000a Yes. So, like, the volume, the rate of change of volume is constant. Is that true on this or is that a different problem? Okay, and so, what is the unknown that you are trying to figure out?\u000a The change of the radius. How the radius is...\u000a And what do you predict will happen with the rate of change of radius with the larger the radius gets?\u000a It'll stretch out.\u000a That, I'm sorry?\u000a It'll slow down.\u000a Yeah, I think that's a good conjecture. That would be like what happened the other day when we looked at it, slowed down quite a bit the bigger the radius got. Sounds good. And it is because it was what?\u000a  The volume...\u000a  'Cause the volume...\u000a  Yeah. \u000a F four for that, that'll go on the left. F four and D six.\u000a  Have you gotten to the balloon part yet? Let's talk about the other one, okay? One. Okay, the other balloon problem was about surface area? Is that right? Have you done this one yet?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay, how many, blow up the balloon and let's see what's happening in that balloon. Kevin, what was happening on this balloon?\u000a  It's the rate of the...\u000a  The puddle?\u000a B, a formula problem.\u000a Okay, so, how is Jesse gonna show us the surface area of DVDT? Okay, so let's demo that. Causing ripples. Thank you, nice demonstration.  What is constant on this problem?\u000a  The area and then... Yeah, the radius?\u000a

V Our goal is to find the answers to your questions so we can fill this column, what I learned, in the KWL chart. Okay? So that's our goal. Our goal is to find the answers to draw a conclusion to our month long experiment. Before we do that, why don't we take another measurement. I would like you to measure your plant, if you have any. And I would like you to count the number of leaves on your plant, on one of them. Go ahead. Scientists take your ruler. Take your ruler and measure. I like the way some of you are holding your rulers. It's great that you put the lower number down when you measure. Great! If it helps you can pick up your plant. Okay. After you have your measurement and the number of leaves, make sure you count the numbers, the leaves too, you may put your plant down. After you put your plant down I know you are ready to continue. Could you touch your head with your empty hands? Good job, John. Touch your head with your empty hands. Wonderful, I see that you're ready, right Katie? Put your hands down. I also took pictures of your experiment. Your pictures will serve as data. That means the information you collected. This group picture were from the people who conducted the experiment to see if seeds would grow with soil, water, and sunlight.\u000a  Sunlight.\u000a We have air all around us so we all have air. I would like you to use good listening ears. Day one. Day 11. That's what it looked like. Day 18, day 24, and day 32. We even have a ruler here, a primary ruler that's easy for kindergartners to use. Now looking at the data and your pictures. What do you think the conclusion is if you did this experiment? If you planted the seeds, you planted your seeds with soil, water and sunlight could you please raise your hand? Good, we have some eager participants. Could you please come up here with your experiment and a ruler and explain to us?\u000a My experiment was if plants will grow with sun, soil, and water and I put them near the windowsill.\u000a Why did you put your cup near the windowsill?\u000a To get some sunlight.\u000a So your seeds received sunlight. Did you water your seeds?\u000a Yes I did.\u000a Okay. And you did put soil?\u000a Yes, in the cup.\u000a Okay. What do you think your conclusion is?\u000a If plants will grow in sun, soil and water.\u000a And what is your answer?\u000a Um.\u000a Did your seeds grow?\u000a Yes.\u000a Did you take a measurement?\u000a Yeah.\u000a May we see how tall they are? How tall are they?\u000a One inch.\u000a Did you see how Kieran measured his plants? He has the end with the lower number touching the base of the plant. That's good scientist! Now how many leaves do you have on some of them?\u000a Four leaves.\u000a And how many did you have last week?\u000a Two.\u000a Two. So what do you think is happening?\u000a They're growing.\u000a They're growing because you have more?\u000a Leaves.\u000a Wonderful! Great job scientist! And now let's look at the next experiment boys and girls. This one is planting seeds without water. Did seeds or plants grow without water? I would like you to look at the data. This is your data just in case you don't remember. Sometimes we don't remember what we did, but pictures help us. Day one, day 11, day 18, day 24, day 32. Hmmm. I wonder what the conclusion is? Oh, John you want to come up and share? Great! Take your experiment and your ruler. And I really love the way Thalia listened.\u000a My experiment was if plants will grow without water. And I put sun, soil. I gave it sun, and I put soil and I never gave it water.\u000a How did you give it sunlight?\u000a I put it by the windowsill.\u000a Okay, so what is your conclusion?\u000a My conclusion is plants will grow without water.\u000a Will grow or won't grow?\u000a Won't grow.\u000a Very good! Thank you.\u000a Thank you very much young scientist. Great job! And let's look at the next experiment. Did seeds grow without soil? Here's day one. Again, scientists look at the smart board. Day 11, day 18, and day 32. Now, who did this experiment? We would like you, come on up Rachel. Bring up your experiment and tell us all about it.\u000a I did an experiment if seeds will grow without soil. And I put seeds, water in it, and I put it by the window. And I gave it sun. And they didn't grow.\u000a What did you not use?\u000a Soil.\u000a You did not use soil. And where are your seeds?\u000a By the window.\u000a They're in your cup right now.\u000a In my cup.\u000a Uh huh.\u000a Would you mind showing the class what you have there? Tilt it down. Boys and girls take a peek. This is what Rachel's seeds...\u000a I can't see.\u000a Okay. So now, what is your conclusion, Rachel?\u000a Seeds won't grow without soil.\u000a Very good. Thank you scientist. We have nothing to measure in Rachel's cup. And the last one. Oh, boys and girls this is a very interesting one. I really would like you to look up here. Look at the data first. Did seeds or plants grow without sunlight? A lot of your cups were by the window so that they received sunlight. But look at this one. Day one. Do you have anything?\u000a  No.\u000a No. Day 11.\u000a  No.\u000a Day 18, look at the number. Look at the numbers on the ruler. Day 24, I want you to look at your data. And day 32. Well, that's some interesting experiment. I know some of you did this one. Quite a number of children. If you did that experiment and you would like to come up and talk nicely and loudly. Juliana would you please come up with your plant and your ruler if you would like? Come on up. Okay, John you're going to show Juliana what a good listener you are, okay? Go ahead buddy.\u000a I planted seeds without sun. And I put them in the closet.\u000a Did you cover your seeds with soil?\u000a Yes.\u000a So your seeds have soil.\u000a Soil.\u000a You watered them?\u000a Watered them.\u000a Every week you watered them? And?\u000a And no sun.\u000a And you did not give them any sunlight because you put them in--\u000a The closet.\u000a In the closet and the closet has no?\u000a Sun.\u000a Has no sunlight. It has no windows. Right, John? Now Juliana, tell the class if you ever had any sprouts.\u000a I did have sprouts.\u000a And what do you think happened?\u000a They died.\u000a How tall were your sprouts at one point.\u000a One inch.\u000a One inch and why do you think they died?\u000a Because they had no sun.\u000a And do you think the sun is important for plants to grow? So what is your conclusion?\u000a No, seeds won't grow without sun.\u000a Very good. Good job scientist. You may go back. Now boys and girls, I'm going to ask you to think about your experiment. Think about what your question was. What you wanted to find out. And the steps you took to do your experiment. And you are going to turn to your partner and ask your partner what they wanted to find out. You may say, "What was your question?" Or, "What do you want to find out?" And here's a big question mark. And after your partner answers then you may ask, "What did you do?" "What steps did you take?" And at the end we will like you to ask your partner, "What is your answer?" How did you know that's the answer? They have to tell you their evidence, what they used to tell you the answer. Okay, now turn to your partner and talk to each other. Remember how we work as partners.  What did you find out?  What was your question?\u000a My question was... \u000a  Take turns.  Gabby, take turns  Boys and girls, let's take 30 more seconds. If you need to use your plants as your evidence feel free.  Okay, boys and girls turn around. Please put your hands on your lap so I can see your empty hands. Alright. Let's look at the answers again. Our whole experiment, and let's look at the questions. Will seeds grow without water? What do you think?\u000a  No.\u000a If you don't think seeds will grow without water shake your head. Great. Cameron will seeds grow without water?\u000a No.\u000a No, good. Okay, next question. Will seeds grow without sunlight?\u000a  No.\u000a Let me see you touch your ears if you don't think seeds will grow without sunlight. Okay, let's see. Will they Cameron?\u000a No.\u000a Touch your ears so I know you understand. Next one, will seeds grow without soil? Yes or no?  Yes. No.\u000a Will seeds grow without soil?\u000a  NO!\u000a No. Touch the ground, touch the rug. Okay, great. The last question, Katie, is will seeds grow with water, sun and soil?\u000a  Yes.\u000a Good. Then make some rain drops. Make the sun and form a cup to hold your soil.\u000a

V So can you record two on that? \u000a It's harder to write two.\u000a Remember, here, you can use your number line if you need it to help you. Do you want me to turn it? So there's the two. Can you try to write it?\u000a  I did it. \u000a Awesome. That looks like a two. So was this awesome, all right, or super bad?\u000a  Super bad.\u000a Super bad. Why do you think it was super bad?\u000a  Because it's not heavy.\u000a Because it's not heavy.  Okay, Julia, what's our second problem?\u000a Ow.\u000a  The styrofoam ball.\u000a The styrofoam ball. Can you find the styrofoam ball?  Yes, that one. We can, first we're gonna make--  This one is bigger. How does it feel, though? Is it round?  It does? We're gonna be answering questions over here. Julia, can you let  make his prediction?  Which one did you pick?\u000a That one.\u000a You picked all right. Why did you pick all right?  Because it's little. How does it feel? Feel it. No, it's not heavy.  What do you think? Is there anything that you're wondering about that?  What's next?  What do you think?\u000a All right again?\u000a You think all right, too?  Mark them all right.  You think awesome? You think it's gonna go 15 or more? Okay, let's see.  Are you ready? Can you pick up the tape and do it again? Gonna get the tape. \u000a You're supposed to do it again.\u000a Because there's another space? Yep, we're gonna actually do it again after we do all of them one time. Okay.   Put it this way. Ivan's gonna put it in, is everyone ready? Oh wait, you have to keep it upside down so it can push. Okay? Can you try it over? Ivan, are you ready? Let's try one more time. I'm gonna put this cup right in front. One more time.    Well, feel it.  Is it heavy?  That's okay. I'm gonna be right back.  Has anything surprised you so far?  What happened?  The orange ball? So what kind of push was it?\u000a An awesome.\u000a  An awesome push. So did that surprise you? You didn't think it was gonna go so far?\u000a I though it was gonna go like .\u000a Is that where the tape went? So you guys can pick up the tape. Should we do the green ball?\u000a The green ball. Which ball so far...\u000a  A zero.\u000a A zero?  And it didn't move at all?\u000a Yes.\u000a Why do you think it didn't move?\u000a Because it's so tiny.\u000a It's so tiny. But does it weigh a lot?\u000a No.\u000a No, it didn't. Do you think that's why it didn't go far?\u000a And it's so tiny. And it doesn't have more mass.\u000a Ahh, I see. So, should we do this again?\u000a Yeah.\u000a The super bad is actually this one right here.\u000a Oh, it's so tiny.\u000a So feel it. How does it feel?  Let Luka feel it. How does it feel?  So Jacob, why don't you make your prediction? From all right to super bad. What do you think, Sofia? What did you put? Why did you put all right?  So right there. How far do you think it's gonna go?  What did you put, Sofia? Sofia picked... Luka, what do you think? Which one do you think? What's it gonna be? Awesome, all right, or super bad? Good pick, all right. So we're gonna do it down here on this one. All right. Are you ready? Make your prediction. And then we're gonna put it on the ground. What do you think? Awesome, all right, or super bad?  Who picked awesome? Sofia, right?  Do you guys have anything that you're--\u000a Remember when we were... \u000a I do remember when we were trying to . What did we find out? What is it?  What do you think for the second ball?   You think a rock is inside? Maybe.\u000a If they were rocks, then they would be so hard.\u000a That's true, is it really hard?\u000a A little.\u000a A little bit hard? What do you think is inside? Can we find out? We can open one of these, probably. Let's put it down first. Everybody write it. Jacob, are you the recorder? What are you? The counselor? Are you the starter? Okay guys, is everyone ready?  You know what? We're gonna do it one more time so that it knocks over the cup.  We can move the tape now.  Sofia, we need you to count. Move the cup over. How far did it go?\u000a One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.\u000a Will you count again with me? Ready?\u000a  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Jacob, this went 10. Can you write 10 down?\u000a No! \u000a For the super bad, it went 10. Yep.\u000a It's super awesome.\u000a So what do you think? Where did it go? Was it awesome, all right, or super bad?\u000a Awesome.\u000a All right.\u000a It was all right. Why was it all right?  And is 10 more or less than 15? Less than 15. So that's why it's all right. Okay guys, I'm gonna go to the next group. Now what you're gonna do is trial two. You're gonna do every ball one more time. Okay? Yep.  We're gonna do it one more time. Okay, I will be right back.    How's it going over here? Has anything surprised you?  What surprised you?  Which ball didn't push it very far?  Wait, how far did it actually push? So that means that the cup didn't move at all?  Why do you think the cup didn't move?  Because it's so light? Which one moved the farthest so far? Which ball?  The orange one? Is the orange ball really light?  How does the orange one feel?  Like it has more mass? Is there anything you guys are wondering about?  If they're bouncy? Let's put this ball back. Does that one bounce?  I wonder why not.  Okay, so what are we putting next on your sheet? What should you do?  Are you putting the rubber ball?  Yeah. Are you guys all putting that you think it's gonna be an awesome push?  Ready?  Put tape here. Alexandra, are you the taper?   \u000a It's on the wrong side.\u000a No, she got it, she did it. So move the cup over. Now Nicholas is gonna count.\u000a One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. \u000a Can you help write in 13?  Yeah, this one right here has a one and a three. Can you try writing that?\u000a It's gonna have one more.\u000a  It's gonna have one more? So if the styrofoam ball went zero, and the orange ball went 13, which one is more?\u000a 13.\u000a How do you know that? You just know that?  When you count, does it come higher? Yes, it does? Okay, Ivan's ball is next. We need to do a trial shoot of which one?  Okay. \u000a You have a red...\u000a Yeah, mine.\u000a What do you guys think about this ball?\u000a It's awesome.\u000a It's awesome? Why is it awesome?\u000a It's awesome because it's red and it's the Cardinals' color.   \u000a Well, I would love for you to come. Should we see how far it goes? All right, let's check it.   It knocked the cup over. Let's try one more time.   It knocked it over again. We're gonna put the tape here.  Do you think that was farther than the rubber ball?  But when the ball goes farther.  Seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.  What?\u000a Can you find it on the number line? Where's 11? Uh huh, that's what it looks like. Is 11 more or less than 13?  Is it more than 13 or less? Which one?  Is what?\u000a More than.\u000a Is more than 11? If you look on the number line. So you're right, 13 is more.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah. Okay, you guys can start putting the balls away.\u000a

V How do you know?  How do you think it might be different? Okay, maybe Ethan goes here . Measure yours and let's see.  And which one do you think you're going under?  I don't know.  Okay, all right.  Okay, well you all, listen to him, listen to him.  You all talk about it.  You talk to them, I'm gonna walk around.\u000a It's my turn, EJ. \u000a  Okay, let him do the writing. \u000a Why are you taking them out of that one?  Okay, and what are you trying to make it do?\u000a Balance.\u000a Okay, balance. Let's see you trying to make it balance.  Okay. \u000a We need to put it right there.\u000a Okay.  Did you balance it now? Okay, so what do put in that point? \u000a  I'm going to scoot this just a little it. And then you write it down, good. How did you know it was balanced? Good.  You said which one was heavier here? Okay, why did you say ?  Think you can do that one? How did you know it was balanced? Is it balanced? What about that?  At first, which one was balanced? Because why?  It was heavy, okay. \u000a Okay, so how many of those are ?\u000a I think it was one more.  Okay, you're put it in. You'll put what in this one?  And the number of crayons you all used.  You had another object that was moving? Look right here. You think their eraser didn't move?\u000a  What you all gonna test next?  Did you even measure that one? \u000a And I'll come back. Alright, what are you all doing here? \u000a Do you think if you did the scissors, and Matthew did the scissors, do you think it would measure the same?\u000a  Let's do it.\u000a Okay. Let's do it one at a time. What's happening? You guys can't measure, try this one. Here's my question. If Matthew blows the paper clip, is it gonna get the same distance as if you blow the paper clip? What do you think? You don't think so? Why not?  Matthew, you blow.  Okay, all right, so remember that, okay? Now, Weslee, I want you to test it. You said you thought it would go different. See if you can make a difference. \u000a Yeah, why did it do something different? What's that that you're blowing out?\u000a Air.\u000a Air, and what is it?\u000a Gas.\u000a Gas, good. All right, you all can go ahead and finish measuring.  I saw Ella trying. Now, if you and Ella both try to blow on that do you think it's going to move? Why don't you think it's going to move?  You think it's too heavy? And you don't have enough breath.  Try it and see. See if you all both do it if you can get it to move.  You're going red in the face and it's going away. Did you all think it was going to move? You all didn't think it was.  How did you find this? What'd you do?\u000a Counted. Okay, counted, and what are you working on right now?  The colors.  Okay, which one do you have to count now ? Which one do you have there?  This one, and what is that one? What is that one? A solid, a liquid, or the gas?\u000a Solid.\u000a A solid, how are you going to find out? What are you gonna do?\u000a Look at this.\u000a You're going to look at those, can you count those? I'm gonna come back and see if you counted and made your graph, okay? You're doing good. Okay. Okay, can you come over here and count? You might have to get out of your chair, you have lots of them. \u000a  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Eight. \u000a Five, six, seven, eight.\u000a Check your numbers, and you checked to make sure. All right, whatcha going to do now?\u000a Tally.\u000a Tally them, okay, think you all can do that? Okay, you need help putting it on , remember which one is the total .  How did you know that so quick? I heard you started counting and then what did you do? You found it quickly.  You remembered from that, okay. How else could have known that fast?\u000a Go down there. Go down there, okay, good. \u000a

V Until I say switch. So you stay at your center when you are finished. When I say switch, you may go to the next center. Okay? All right, so. Here are different centers. You know where you go, you may go to your center, and you may begin.  Let's go back again, let's make sure we're pushing. There you go. \u000a 14, 14, 14. Where should we start them? Good job. Nice job. Where do you think we should start our cubes when we're gonna measure?\u000a Here.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Because we wanna line it up where it starts.\u000a Good.\u000a Nathan used more force to do it.\u000a Right, Nathan used a little bit more force than you, didn't he? So when you used more force, what did that do?\u000a It made it go farther.\u000a It made it go farther, good job. All right guys, if you are done, put your thumbs up. If you are still working, raise your hand in the air. Okay, I'm gonna give you about one more minute to finish up.  All right, how did it go?\u000a  Okay, very nice.  Where should we start it? Now if we're measuring, where do we need to start the cube? Nice job.  All right, I want you to stop what you're doing. You need to pick up your clipboard and your pencil, and you need to switch. Leave the cubes and the pucks at the station. Clipboards, pencils, and switch. \u000a We have no puck over here.\u000a Here it is. Have an idea for you. Okay, hold on a second, let's go down the list. I want you to come back, put that away. I saw Teddy go like this and put his fingers here, and go up. Why did you do that, Teddy? Where it was, but when he marks the paper there, he needs to really leave it there and then push the other ones up. And I need someone else to come over here and measure. Now, we knew it was 10 here, what are we gonna count next? What comes after 10?\u000a 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.\u000a 15, okay, go ahead and record that.\u000a How do we know when it's supposed to be a ? \u000a Okay, so whose turn is this one?\u000a Mine. Where do you need to start lining it up?\u000a 50.\u000a  15?\u000a 50.\u000a  50? So if we did 10, what comes after 10? 11...\u000a 12, 13, 14.\u000a  14. Right there. Nice job. All right, stop what you're doing. I want you to go ahead, pick up your clipboard and your pencils, and you may switch.  \u000a Let me do it.\u000a Can I ask a question?\u000a Sure, what would you like to ask me?  All right? Okay. That's a good question. All right, who's gonna go next in this group? Okay, why don't you hold on one second. Can you move over a little bit? Get behind it and push it. \u000a 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...\u000a Yeah, I did.\u000a What do you notice about those two numbers?\u000a Oh, it's two 19's.\u000a I think Amber might get the 19.\u000a You think she might get 19?\u000a No, she didn't.\u000a  Do you wanna try pushing it again?\u000a Here, start behind.  Nice job. All right guys, go ahead and switch one more time. Take your pencil and your clipboard. \u000a You can go first.\u000a Okay, guys. Let's get our pencil so that we know exactly where it is.\u000a Right here.\u000a Okay, so now go ahead and count. So what did you come up with?\u000a 13.\u000a  13, good job. Let's turn the clipboard around so you can.\u000a Three backwards.\u000a 35.\u000a Whoa!\u000a All right, now whose turn is it?\u000a DaMonte's turn.\u000a Go ahead, DaMonte. Now where do we need to start counting?\u000a Right here.\u000a Can you give him some tips? Where do you think he should start counting?\u000a Right here.\u000a Okay, and why?\u000a The line.\u000a That's where the tape begins, right? Or you could even go like this and start it at the tape and then you use your pencil.\u000a So where does the pencil stop?\u000a Right here.\u000a Okay, so then count to there. I'll hold it for you, you count.\u000a 10.\u000a Ben, what do you think? Can you help him?\u000a Seven.\u000a So Ben thought that he got seven.\u000a Yeah, it's seven.\u000a Okay, so we're gonna stop where the thing begins, so we're gonna stop at the seven, okay? Here you go, good job.  Okay, I want you to stop what you're doing. I want you to quickly come to the carpet with your pencil and your clipboard. Come to your circle spot. I'm gonna count down from five, I want you to be on the carpet at zero. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. And zero. I love how you guys get to the carpet so nice and quietly. Thank you. Give yourself a pat on the back for doing a really good job. Now, I wanna know what you noticed about using the different surfaces. What did you notice about the tile, what did you notice about the wood, what did you notice about the cloth, and what did you notice about the carpet? Sophia.\u000a I noticed that the cloth and the carpet was harder.\u000a It was harder? And so what do you think happened?\u000a The puck slowed down.\u000a The puck slowed down, what made it slow down?\u000a The bumps on the towel.\u000a The bumps on the towel, and when we watched that video that talked about the bumps, do you remember what they called that? What is it that causes those bumps?\u000a  Nathaniel?\u000a It pushes back.\u000a It does, it pushes it back. What's that big word that we've been talking about?\u000a Friction.\u000a Friction, so do you think there was more friction on the towel?\u000a Not when I did it.\u000a Okay, so Monalisa, share what you noticed.\u000a When I pushed mine, it went all the way down.\u000a It went all the way down, so which one had more friction when you were testing it? Which one slowed down or did not go as far?\u000a  Which surface was slower, do you remember?\u000a The carpet.\u000a The carpet, so the carpet for you had the most friction? Okay, so does anyone else wanna talk about their surface? Kayley.\u000a The cloth, when I pushed the puck, it went kind of far, but not really far, because of all the bumps.\u000a Which surface had the least amount of friction? Daniel.\u000a Wood.\u000a The wood. Give me a thumbs up if the wood was also the one with the least amount of friction. Good job!\u000a

V  What?\u000a It's a dark color.\u000a  So what does that mean?\u000a We think the sun might hit it or light might hit it faster so it might melt faster.\u000a  Keegan, how are you going to figure out how much it weighs?\u000a Maybe, it will melt faster because the water.\u000a  What about that, explain your thinking.\u000a Because...\u000a You've stolen her even. Now we got to count it. One, two.\u000a No, now you're taking them all.\u000a Three, we got to count, four, five, six.\u000a Here.\u000a Seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12\u000a  Freeze for just one second. Let's switch and have the boys keep on. You stopped at 20. Boys, finish counting. They stopped at 20, finish counting.\u000a 21, 22, 23, 24.\u000a But they're not counting, they're just putting it in. It's not working.\u000a They're just putting it in in the same time.\u000a  So freeze gentlemen. So how do you think you could fix that?\u000a Put it back in.\u000a  You might want to try to remeasure. Definitely want to.\u000a  Miss T look.\u000a  Guys, we need to take a bunch of it out because it's not really getting weighed.\u000a You might need to use something heavier.\u000a  Oh, remember, you're not supposed to touch that nob on the back. That's not how you, how would you figure out how to weigh it?\u000a What happened?\u000a  What's going on Daniel? Tell me what the problem is.\u000a It has too much, oh sorry. It has too much water in it.\u000a Yeah.\u000a  Well, can we change that scientists?\u000a No.\u000a  What can we change?\u000a We can take out a lot.\u000a It's too heavy. It was reaching on that side.\u000a Six halves.\u000a This is heavier.\u000a  Wait, say that again Brayden. What did I just hear you say?\u000a I said it's heavier.\u000a This is heavier than the blocks, so we put more in.\u000a  Oh.\u000a Yeah, we're going to put more in.\u000a Oh way too much, way too much.\u000a Whoa, look.\u000a Uh-uh.\u000a Ms. Teacher, Ms. T, I think it's six and a half.\u000a  What is six and a half?\u000a The measure.\u000a  Oh, is that your predication, that's your what?\u000a That's my hypothesis.\u000a  Oh, how are you going to find out if it's true?\u000a What do we do?\u000a  Can you maybe explain to Teagan what she needs to do?\u000a Just balance it. They're like working on it.\u000a There we go, got it.\u000a Got it.\u000a  Daniel, what were you saying?\u000a We were going to like...\u000a We just figured out how much blocks it weighs.\u000a Hang on, it'll get there.\u000a  So what did you discover?\u000a We discovered we had, we discovered we had to take...\u000a We had to take one, two, three, four of the blocks out.\u000a Five.\u000a Five of the blocks out to make it weigh.\u000a  So how much does it weigh?\u000a So let me count the blocks. One, two, three, four.\u000a Do you want me to hold the balloon so it doesn't fall?\u000a Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.\u000a How many does it weigh?\u000a Okay, I'll start wearing this. I mean I'll start writing it.\u000a  No, I got it.\u000a  What are you doing there Abigail?\u000a Well, I'm weighing and it's not showing up yet.\u000a  What are you using that tool for?\u000a What tool? This tool?\u000a To see how cold it is.\u000a  So did you already weigh it?\u000a We have to hold it from the top.\u000a  Oh, so do you think it's going to weigh more now that you taped that to it? What's your prediction with that? Do you have a prediction?\u000a I have a prediction that it might be really cold.\u000a  And that's going to tell you that? But have you weighed yours yet?\u000a  No.\u000a And it's going to turn to ice.\u000a  So, but should you keep that thermometer on it while you weigh it or do you think it'll change how much it weighs?\u000a I think it will actually change how much it weighs.\u000a  Can you explain your thinking.\u000a Because, because the thermometer is heavy too and it would change how much...\u000a One pound.\u000a ...it was so we should probably get the thermometer.\u000a One pound.\u000a So we can, so we can, so we can weigh it and then we can put it back on.\u000a My hypothesis is it's going to be 20 degrees.\u000a My hypothesis is this is going to change it because it's only one pound.\u000a  Oh, so what are you going to do to test that?\u000a Weigh it.\u000a  Okay.\u000a Put it here, put it here.\u000a  Oh, are you guys discussing? What are you guys discussing?\u000a Where we are going to put our balloons.\u000a  So first talk to me about your balloon. Why did you choose this color?\u000a Because it was a light color and we think it might melt faster.\u000a We will think it will melt slower. We think it will melt slower.\u000a  Why?\u000a Because.\u000a Because it's a light color.\u000a The sun is attracted to the dark colors so that's why we picked pink.\u000a  So what are you doing right now?\u000a Doing a hypothesis.\u000a  Oh, can you explain what's your hypothesis, Teagan?\u000a It will be warm because we're going to put it next to the heater.\u000a That's what I was going to say too.\u000a  And so what's your hypothesis? How will that change the balloon?\u000a Because maybe you said we're going to put it in the freezer and then when we take it out we'll put it in the heater and we think it'll melt faster.\u000a  Okay.\u000a What about us?\u000a It's almost in the middle, take out one more.\u000a  Now I'm going to count.\u000a  What were you guys just doing down there?\u000a  She was thinking about the weight.\u000a  What does that mean?\u000a Like in the middle.\u000a  Okay, so how will you figure out how much it weighs?\u000a We need to take this out and we'll count them and then we'll write it on the paper.\u000a  32, 32.\u000a 12, 13, 14.\u000a  Brayden? Brayden?\u000a Hi.\u000a  Hayden?\u000a  Is there any group that's measuring the length of their's?\u000a 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,\u000a Almost there. 43, 44, 45, 46, 47. It's there, it's there.\u000a  What does that mean?\u000a So it means that they weigh the same thing.\u000a Okay.\u000a Now we have to count them.\u000a Let's let Will only do it.\u000a Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,\u000a 64, 64.\u000a  Teagan, be working in your group.\u000a 23, 24, 25.\u000a I measured my balloon by using tiles, like tiles when I measured it. Tiles. What should we do now, Mrs. T? My balloon is filled with matter.\u000a  Why do you say that?\u000a Because everything is matter. Well, there's water inside the balloon so it's like solid and liquid.\u000a  Why is it solid and liquid? What were you saying? What were you saying? No, keep explaining your thinking.\u000a  I have a question.\u000a  One second.\u000a Water is a liquid and pushes on the weight.\u000a  Oh, so is that kind of tying in to your hypothesis?\u000a Light turns into water, solids and liquids.\u000a My hypothesis is, my hypothesis is if we like, if we... If we lose the like point it will not melt faster.\u000a  Why?\u000a It's a darker color.\u000a And when you think about it, dark colors will melt faster on their own.\u000a Is that cubes, the  has the cubes?\u000a  No, that's the weight. Pass it on. Have you all measured yours yet?\u000a  Yes.\u000a  How'd you measure it?\u000a With the tape thingy.\u000a  Would you mind showing me what you decide to do?\u000a My hypothesis is that it will melt faster because we're putting it by the sun.\u000a  Did you make a hypothesis by the length of it? No?\u000a Ours was six and a half inches.\u000a  How do you know?\u000a Because we measured it with the measuring tape.\u000a  Can you show me how you did it? Oh, there's an extra one Will.\u000a Did you say not to touch the balloon without the thermometer?\u000a  Now do we draw a picture of what it looks like right now?\u000a  These have bigger numbers you know.\u000a  So what are you thinking there Abigail?\u000a I'm thinking that not really.\u000a  But what were you saying there with the bigger numbers? I didn't understand. You held up the number line and you said those have bigger numbers.\u000a I mean like you can see them very well and you also can tell. 30.\u000a 30?\u000a 30, he should start now.\u000a  So how big is your balloon?\u000a We got to start at one.\u000a  Oh why did you change it Julia, from your first measurement?\u000a Because we accidentally started from the 30.\u000a  Oh.\u000a And now we have it upside down.\u000a  Okay, you got it? It was, it is, move your finger for me. It is...\u000a Now let's send this back here.\u000a Okay, I think we should do my idea for taking that thermometer off.\u000a Yeah.\u000a Yeah, I'll hold the thermometer.\u000a I'm trying to take it off.\u000a My hypothesis is it's going to be warm, but then not attracted to the light.\u000a Cold water is in there.\u000a Because sunlight can only make warmth. Right?\u000a

V So, these two are gonna combine and make six X squared?\u000a Yes.\u000a Okay and then what about this guy?\u000a Just bring him down.\u000a Alright, what about her?\u000a You can bring her down.\u000a Okay.\u000a That's a four X to the fourth, not four X squared.\u000a Ah, thank you. Four X to the fourth. And is this term positive or negative?\u000a Positive.\u000a And what about this term?\u000a Positive. And what do we call this guy?  Rock on, okay good, good, good. Alright, easy one, you ready? Three X times X squared plus four X minus two. And this time we're multiplying, what kind of monomial is that?\u000a Linear.\u000a Linear, good. Times a quadratic what?\u000a Trinomial.\u000a Trinomial, awesome. Go ahead and distribute that and see what you get. When you think you have an answer do you wanna show it to the person next to you and see if you agree or disagree with each other? Alright, alrighty. So. Any exciting disagreements?\u000a No.\u000a Nothing.  No one differs from anyone else?\u000a No.\u000a Larry Thayer.\u000a He just forgot to write his  down.\u000a Okay, but now you're cool? So, everybody either feels like they got the same thing or they fixed what thought they had? Alright, that's boring. Okay, so what do get when you your first product done?\u000a Three X cubed.\u000a Alright, and then?\u000a 12 X squared.\u000a And then?\u000a Six X.\u000a And then?\u000a Nothing, it's simplified.\u000a It's done? Okay. So, we ended up with a cubic trinomial. Now, here's what I wanna show you. Somethin' a little different, because what's the, raise your hand if you can tell me the verb we did here.\u000a Cubic?\u000a We been talkin' the verb.\u000a Distributed?\u000a We distributed and we also what?\u000a Simplified.\u000a Which one's right? They're both, we simplified and we used distributing in order to simplify. Okay, so I'm gonna put a verb up here. And I'll even put distribute because that's specifically what we did. Now, here's what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna give you a different thing. I'm gonna give you this. I'm gonna give you four A cubed plus two A squared minus 10 A. And I'm gonna spice this up just a little bit, I'm sorry about that, change that 10 A to a 40 A. Alright.\u000a It's already simplified.\u000a It's already simplified, okay. So, I can't give you simplify for a verb. I'm gonna give you a different verb. Now, there's a better word than what I'm about to put up here. This isn't really a math word, we're gonna replace it with a better one very shortly. And here's a clue. Undistributed. How do you undistribute? Let's shove this expression that you said's already simplified, in a time machine. Imagine you got like a, have you guys ever seen like fast feed photography where there's a seed? And it's like they speed up the footage and you see the seed germinate and you see the little stem grow, and it's kind of all jerky and everything. Okay, can you imagine playing that backwards and you have a little sprout and it goes back in and it ends up as a little seed. Right? Imagine that this was on the page as a final answer and we put it in backwards to see how it might have started as a math problem.\u000a Do you use the ?\u000a You can do that?\u000a Do you use like the factor tree?\u000a Say that a little louder, Alec.\u000a Do you use the factor trees?\u000a Alec, that's interesting that you asked. Alec is asking about our warm-up problem today, which was a throw-back to when you guys were in elementary school and you talked about things called factor trees. And with factor trees we talk about how you can take a number and use a sledgehammer and kind of bust it up  into it's what?\u000a To it's factors.\u000a To its factors and we keep goin' until we can't do it anymore, right? Huh.\u000a The deal with that is you have to figure out what was originally inside and outside of the parentheses. You just gotta kinda ignore the A, I guess.\u000a Even ignoring the A like, I don't know if putting it in a facts tree you really put it into parentheses. 'Cause you don't really have a whole lot to work with there, to put it back into parentheses, I don't know. It's kinda going against every fiber of my being and--\u000a  Like why would you make a math problem out of a perfectly nice number?\u000a Yeah.\u000a Okay, that's interesting, we'll come back to that cuz that's a really good point. Why would you take like a 12 and turn it into a math problem, what good does that do? Yeah, what good is that? We'll come back to that, that's an excellent question. With big answers. Yes sir, what do you think?\u000a I forgot what I was gonna say.\u000a Ya sure? Lauren, what d'ya think?\u000a Isn't this kinda like checking it?\u000a Lauren just said something interesting. She said "Isn't it kinda like checking it?" So, when you check an equation for example, what do you do?\u000a Put it back in .\u000a So, when you solve an equation, it's kinda like tying a knot. And then when you put it in, put in the solution and you check it it's kinda like untying the knot to see if comes out the same way.\u000a But we don't have an equation to plug those into.\u000a You're right. Carolyn, what were you gonna say?\u000a Okay, so you know how yesterday, I know this is kind of off subject but I--\u000a That's okay.\u000a You know how yesterday like you showed us this problem on our worksheet and it was like three times the binomial or whatever? When you said we were gonna do those today?\u000a Can you be specific with the problem so I know what exactly.\u000a It was number 50 on--\u000a Oh, oh you mean the problems that look like this.\u000a Yeah. the ones that we said we've already done but we really haven't.\u000a Like this? And you guys wanted to make this, what did you wanna make this?  X squared, oh it feels so right, doesn't it? We'll come back to that in a second. That is sort of related to this. What were you gonna say Zach and then we'll take a closer look.\u000a I was just gonna say, couldn't there be different, like when you unsimplify that, couldn't there be different answers? Or is there only one correct answer?\u000a Can someone restate what he's sayin' here? Or what do you think he means by that? Sam, what do you think he means by that?\u000a I think he means that when like you unsimplify it it can be with the two parentheses or it can be with one parentheses and the term in front of it.\u000a So, you're sayin' maybe it's like this and there's something here. Or maybe, it's like this?\u000a Yeah.\u000a 'Cause this looks, I'll tell you, this looks an awful lot like the answer we got here. And this didn't start off with a number that was distributed necessarily like this one. It started off like this, didn't it?\u000a How do you figure out how to throw it backwards? 'Cause that's just like...\u000a You know what, let's start with the easier one. Which one of those is less complicated, the blue one or the orange one?\u000a The blue one.\u000a I'd agree, let's start with this way and then maybe we can go up to the orange. So if I wanted to, again this is not a math term, we're gonna use a better term in a little bit. If I were to quote undistribute, or use a vacuum cleaner to suck something out of all three of these terms, would you agree that it has to be the same thing that we suck out of each one? In other words, can I pull a four out of this and an eight out of this?\u000a yeah.\u000a Okay.  Any suggestions? Let's just focus on the coefficients, any suggestions on what I can pull out?\u000a A two.\u000a A two, okay. Anything else?\u000a Four?\u000a Can I pull a four, let's go door to door. Can he give me a four? Can he give me a four? Can she? So, if there was a four out there I would have to think what was in there to distribute a four two to make two. I'm gonna avoid fractions here.\u000a Yeah see, he's avoiding fractions.\u000a I could, I could technically pull out anything. But with the factor tree we did at the beginning of class, typically when you talk about, that's a good point. When we talk about factors we stick with whole numbers. Okay? Or maybe even integers, but we usually don't go into fractions. Sam, what're you thinkin'?\u000a To unsimplify it, couldn't you put in one of those boxes that we did yesterday for the terms? Like put it in the middle and then find what it is?\u000a Oh yeah.\u000a Why, you're talkin' when we were doing  this.  And then ask ourselves what would go here, that's a weird question mark. What would there and what would go there? That's interesting. Alec, what are you thinking?\u000a Couldn't you take out an A with that two? Like on the problem?\u000a Since it all has A's? If you can take out a, can you put out an A, like you took out the two? \u000a Can he give up an A?\u000a Yes.\u000a Can he give up an A?\u000a Yes.\u000a She give up an A?\u000a Yes.\u000a Well, let's try that, let's try that, that's interesting. So if I were to quote, and again, we're not gonna use this word much after the next. Would you, if you were to quote undistribute a two A from four A cubed, what would that look like? What would have to be here?\u000a It would have to be a two A squared.\u000a Well okay, let's keep goin' and then we'll check to see if this makes sense. I'll get your question in one second, Caroline. So then what would be next?  So, the two from the two would leave a ghost one. And then the A from the A squared would be a what, Oscar?\u000a I was thinkin' one A.\u000a One A, alright I'd like that. And then the two A from the negative 40 A would be a what?\u000a Negative 20.\u000a Negative 20 A?  So, now we're back to what Justin said. We've taken a perfectly nice, simplified polynomial and turned it into a math problem. Let's see if this is even right. What do you think we could do to check ourselves like Lauren suggested?\u000a Do the problem.\u000a What do you mean do the problem?\u000a Simplified.\u000a Okay, so let's simplify it real quick. What's two A times two A, and no peeking?\u000a Four A squared.\u000a What's two A times two A cubed, I mean squared? Four A cubed, good. And what's two A times A?\u000a That's two A squared.\u000a What kind? Positive two A squared. And two A times negative 20?\u000a Negative 40 A.\u000a Oh, it worked!\u000a Yeah. \u000a I have a question.\u000a Yes, ma'am.\u000a What exactly is the point of this?\u000a That's an excellent question. Shhhhhh, ready? Why on earth would you do such a horrible rotten thing?  Well, one day, shhhh. One day what if you had this beast?\u000a Holy Cow!\u000a Whoa!\u000a Do you guys know where to start? No, I don't know. But, check this out. Didn't you just say we could take this and turn it? That's the same thing we had, right? So, can I factor that and turn that into two A times two A squared plus A minus 20? Are you cool with that? Are you okay if I just leave the bottom? Two A squared plus A minus 20. Anybody have an idea what might happen now?  Did you guys know that you've been doin' that since the fourth grade?\u000a No.\u000a Yes, you have. Just with much less obnoxious numbers. What does 16/32, what does that, let me use another. What does that simplify to? Here's why, you guys probably already knew this. Let's leave the 16 alone, and isn't 32 two times 16?\u000a Yeah. Ohhh!\u000a That's the math. That's the math that justifies simplifying fractions like you've been doin' since you were like eight years old.\u000a That's cool.\u000a What other occasion, this is gonna be helpful. How do you undo plus or adding when you're solving equations?\u000a Subtraction.\u000a Subtraction, you call in the opposite, right? How do you undo multiplication?\u000a You divide.\u000a Divide, well here's what we're leading up to. How are you gonna undo the squared? Factoring busts up the squared for us. And it's gonna be a very important tool when we're solving, what kind of equations do you think we can call these?  Think about it. Look at the degree.\u000a Oh, quadratic.\u000a Quadratic equations.  Alright, let's take a look at another one. Let me have you undistribute one again. We need a better word for this. Did we call this unmulltiplying?\u000a No.\u000a What did we call the verb here, what was the verb on this?\u000a Division?\u000a

V Anybody tell me how much cases usually run? \u000a At Radio Shack, they're 30 dollars.\u000a Okay, you know what? So we'll factor that in in a minute. But Alex, you had your hand raised. So I'd like to hear from you.\u000a I was just gonna say that the 199, tax is gonna come in anyway, so \u000a What if you got a deal about it that paid the tax and shipping? \u000a Okay, hold up. Cynthia.\u000a But even though... Even though if you use 12, you're only gonna have a couple dollars left over. With the economy these days, things are not cheap. So you can't buy something with five dollars. You're not gonna get a case for that cheap.\u000a That's probably right. \u000a I'm gonna hear two more of you, and then I have something I wanna drop into this conversation that several of you talked about, and I think is really important to point out. So I wanna hear what you two have to say, and then I'm gonna go back to something several of you kinda mentioned. Go ahead.\u000a It's better to have more money than less money because if you exactly calculate it to... then you'd still have zero dollars left, but it's better to have equal or more money.\u000a Okay, that's, you know I think you're right. That seems like it just makes sense, right? And one more, yeah.\u000a Actually, when I bought my phone, I got a case just for about five dollars on ebay.\u000a Ebay, so you got a used one?\u000a And it paid for shipping, so I didn't, yes I did.\u000a Okay well you know what? I wanna talk about that because that's actually what you guys just said is really important, and several of you others mentioned it. Maybe we don't want, maybe I don't want to have the exactly the price, maybe I want to have at least... And if I say I wanna have at least 200 dollars, is there a way to say at least with math symbols? To make that equation change so it says least. 'Cause right now, it says equal. Is there a way to do it so it says at least? Colin?\u000a If you, you need to get the iPhone and the case in the same shipping order, or else it's gonna cost more for shipping.\u000a Oh okay. So yeah, I need at least a certain amount.\u000a Yeah. So you're gonna .\u000a Wanna jump in on that, guys?\u000a You need to put the greater than or equal to sign.\u000a But what does that look like?\u000a The greater than sign with a line under it.\u000a Okay. And what's the word in English that we have for that symbol? Yeah, say it again, Alexis.\u000a That least.\u000a It is. So now, how much do I need to save to get at least 200 dollars, right? So it's okay if I have exactly or more than. So that kinda talks about what you guys are talking about. Maybe I need more money, if she wants more, more than just a phone. I'm sure she does, right?\u000a With the...  What about the  just come with the phone. Just that, or does it come with something else? Like a... Charger, battery, or even a case itself.\u000a So again you're saying I need at least 200 dollars, right? Depending on what comes with the phone.\u000a  like a Christmas special? Like half off or something? \u000a What you can... Also think is where you gonna buy it? And where is there's no tax and stuff? So, it depends on where you're gonna buy it. If you want no tax, that means like on Ebay or something, but...  It might be 50 percent off and stuff like that.\u000a Okay, interesting.\u000a I'm just saying, it depends where you're gonna buy your phone.\u000a Okay, no, I like that a lot.\u000a When I was doing my equation, I got 121. So you would still have a dollar left over. And you know how Cassidy said that she can get it on Ebay, that much. Most people, they... I understand that it's cheap, and most people want it like that, but I bought stuff off the line before, and some of the stuff does work good, and some of 'em you drop them and it breaks. So, it's not always good.\u000a Somethin' to pay attention to. All right, I'm gonna change the conversation a little bit because I think you guys are doing really really well. Let's go with what you guys said and say I need at least 200 dollars. If that's true, is there any way to find out, or to answer the original question, which Nick brought up. How much money do I need to save each day based on what we have so far? Where do I go from here?\u000a There is a way to solve it. You grab 200 dollars, and then you subtract 80 from it.\u000a Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there. I don't mean to interrupt. Katherine, you're watching this and I saw your paper, what do you think about what Najeem just said?\u000a Like \u000a Okay, and why is that?\u000a I don't know. That's how you solve it in equality.\u000a Okay, so can you repeat what you said?\u000a You subtract 80 from both sides.\u000a Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and do that right now. And what does that leave us with?\u000a 120.\u000a And you know what, I have a question. What does that 120 represent? I mean, if 200 is how much the phone costs, what's 120 about? I'm not sure.\u000a How much you need to raise, until then.\u000a Okay, okay. And Nayanna? Can you comment on what you think might be the next step?\u000a Divide 12 from 120.\u000a Again.\u000a Divide 12 from 120.\u000a Okay. And, somebody else, jump in.\u000a The answer was . The answer would be 10 because 12 and 120 equals 10.\u000a Okay, and Katie you were ready to say something. What would you say?\u000a I was about to say .\u000a Equals 10. X equals 10 and-- \u000a X equals at least 10.\u000a Oh, it was so you're not liking what I wrote over here, Alexis.\u000a At least 'cause you have to keep the  all the way down.\u000a Okay, Katherine, what do you think?\u000a I agree with Alexis because... it can't just like change, because...\u000a When you say it can't change, what do you mean?\u000a the side.\u000a Oh  Okay, that's good . I didn't know what it was I'm just asking.\u000a And then you have to put what X means. \u000a Oh, Oh. Oh, so what is the label? What are the units we're talkin' about?  Ah.\u000a  the blue tooth. If you wanna have a little extra money, you could have more, and plus, if you get a little extra money one day, but you have the same another, and you get a little less the next day, you could raise up for another day.\u000a Oh, like if I'm going to collect cans and I don't collect as many cans one day, but I collect extra the next day.\u000a Yeah, like that.\u000a Nayanna, you had your hand raised.\u000a When you have to add 40 to 200, for the Bluetooth.\u000a Ah, that's an interesting idea. So maybe we, so tell me what to write. Instead of this, how would you change this to incorporate what you just said?\u000a 80 plus X equals 240.\u000a Okay, are you pleased, are you okay with that?\u000a I disagree.\u000a Cynthia.\u000a I disagree with your answer on that one. I don't agree that it's 10 because if like they were saying earlier if you wanted some extra money, you would... You should... You should do 11 for a day because if you do you'll get 132, and then you'll have extra money.\u000a Okay. \u000a But that's the problem .\u000a What do you mean when you say it's not asking?\u000a Well, it's not asking for extra money, or anything, it's just asking how many... How much money you need per day. \u000a Anthony, I noticed you've got some stuff written down. What do you think about... I wanna go back to what Nayanna said. She says she's gonna change the equation here, and she put 240 up there, why? Why did she do that, and do you agree with that?\u000a Yeah, 'cause then you would have a little extra money left.\u000a A little bit.\u000a You would have a little bit of extra money left.\u000a Okay.\u000a  like the Bluetooth in the case, maybe?\u000a Okay.\u000a Isn't this another problem? Another problem  not a part of this one yet?\u000a Yeah, 'cause they're not asking how much extra money do you need. This problem, this question's not asking how much extra do you need for a Bluetooth, also.\u000a Okay.\u000a How much are the phone and Bluetooth, it's just asking for the phone.\u000a Okay. \u000a I think because... The question wasn't asking to bring extra money into it. We just brought the extra money to round the, make the equation easier and round the and extra money is okay, but we shouldn't change the equation. 'Cause it's not asking you to.\u000a Okay.\u000a This question isn't saying anything about case or a Bluetooth yet, it's a yes question. And this question talks about Bluetooth.\u000a Okay, so what I kinda like is you guys were doin' this problem, and a couple of ya jumped ahead to this problem, which is no problem at all. Let's jump ahead just for a minute and assume that I did want to get the Bluetooth. Would this be the equation to represent? And before I answer this question, what I would like to do, I'm gonna call on Olivia, and then I'm gonna have everybody switch so the pilots go back to the co-pilots, and the pilots come up, but not yet. Let's hear what Olivia has to say.\u000a Would it be  equals 12 X, if you wanted to get it before Christmas? Or would it be after?\u000a One more time, I could barely hear ya.\u000a Would we still get that before Christmas, or would it be after?\u000a Before, before.\u000a So would it be 12?\u000a Comments on that?\u000a I agree with that. \u000a Thumbs up if you think 12, thumbs down if you think no, we don't need 12 on this one. Okay, Adrian, you have something?\u000a We need to know how much money you earned each day.\u000a Well that's... What do you guys think about that question?\u000a Well that's what we're finding out right now.\u000a I know, but how much you earn. That's how much he has to save.\u000a Pilots, switch with somebody in the back.  All right, here we go. So now, I have a question for you. Can everybody turn around for just a minute please? Thank you. Question for you. If I wanted to graph our first solution on a number line, what might that graph look like? So will you guys agree that okay, we need to earn a minimum amount. And at least 10 dollars a day, but if I wanted to graph that, put that on a number line represent that graphically, what would that look like?\u000a It would be like a... It would be . But the circle... \u000a What kind of circle? I didn't hear you.\u000a Shaded.\u000a So you want to put this up here?\u000a Yeah. \u000a Amarra, I'd like to hear your opinion on that.\u000a I don't, I never understood the shaded thing. I don't know why it's shaded.\u000a It's shaded because it's not, I think if it's not shaded it means greater than, I mean greater or less than. But when it's shaded I think . It means equal to or less than or... With.\u000a Okay, Tara, do you wanna contribute to that \u000a Well, whenever it says greater than, or equal to, the dotted means it could be 10 because it could be equal to, or greater than, which is over 10. But greater than or less than can't be that number so it has to be open circle. And than greater than or equal to.\u000a Anybody have an example of a problem or words that we would use to put an open circle, unshaded circle? In real life, what might we say for something to represent an unshaded circle?\u000a Go ahead, Al.\u000a Fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils.\u000a A little louder.\u000a I got fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils.\u000a So in that problem, could 14 students have mechanical pencils, if you have fewer than 14?\u000a No.\u000a So that would be unshaded. 'Cause 14 doesn't count. So in this question, Amarra, the least number of money I should save per day is how much?\u000a I think 10 is a good answer. because it does go into the number.\u000a And so would be shaded or unshaded?\u000a Shaded.\u000a Oh, is that the only number amount of money I should save each day? Is that it? Are their other possibilities out?\u000a Yeah, you could do--\u000a
